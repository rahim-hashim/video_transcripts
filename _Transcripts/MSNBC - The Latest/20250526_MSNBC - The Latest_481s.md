# Gives Trump 'an out' politically: RFK Jr. prepared to rework review of mifepristone
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0)
*  We know quite a bit now on many of JFK Jr.'s controversial takes on things like vaccines, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=0.0s)]
*  autism, and nutrition. They're based on questionable, even downright debunked science. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  But now his attraction to the scientific fringe seems to be encroaching on abortion care. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=12.0s)]
*  He's leaning on what the Atlantic is calling a particularly questionable study that could [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=21.04s)]
*  change the FDA's assessment of the abortion pill, Mifepristone, which has been used safely [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=24.8s)]
*  and reliably for decades. Joining us now, UC Davis law professor Mary Ziegler, who has written [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=29.44s)]
*  several books on the history of abortion in America, and former Obama White House Health [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=35.68s)]
*  Policy Director and NBC News medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel. All right, so Mary, this study [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=40.0s)]
*  on Mifepristone, what is it based on? What did it show? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  So it was based on emergency codes that insurers offer. And they claim to show that the actual [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=51.12s)]
*  rate of serious complications related to Mifepristone was in fact, you know, 20 times, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=60.72s)]
*  more than 20 times higher than had been reported by the FDA. So the argument here, I think, is not [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=66.8s)]
*  just that Mifepristone is dangerous, but to give President Trump sort of an out politically to say, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=73.04s)]
*  I did sort of promise not to touch abortion restrictions nationally, but I didn't know that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=78.08s)]
*  this data was available. It's by a group called the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which is not [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=85.12s)]
*  typically involved in medical research of any kind. It was conducted by the organization's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=90.0s)]
*  president and head of data analysis. So these are not people who usually do this kind of work. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=95.2s)]
*  And it obviously, I think, was pursued in part because there was a feeling not only that the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=100.72s)]
*  Trump administration was dragging its feet on abortion, but also that there would need to be [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=107.36s)]
*  some kind of new data to justify an about-face by the president on what had been his previously [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=111.36s)]
*  taken public position. So do you believe that this was always something that they were [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=116.64s)]
*  going to try to do? And now they're looking for a justification for it, Mary? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  I do. I think that there has always been an, there's been an attack on Mifepristone, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  really, since Mifepristone was first approved by the FDA in 2000. And I think the previous hope had [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=129.76s)]
*  been that existing questions raised by anti-abortion groups would be enough for the Trump [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=134.88s)]
*  administration. But that didn't appear to be the case. And President Trump was very vocal about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=138.88s)]
*  saying this issue should be left to the states. There were going to be no transformational changes [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=143.68s)]
*  at the national level, really on the campaign trail and to some degree afterwards. So I think [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  there was beginning to become a sense that more needed to be done to give him some kind of political [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=152.0s)]
*  leverage or room to maneuver. And I think that's part of what we're seeing with this study. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=158.0s)]
*  And Dr. Patel, just the study claims more than 10% of people who use Mifepristone experience [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=163.84s)]
*  serious adverse events. That's a big number, 10%. The reality though, past studies, and by the way, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=171.28s)]
*  this drug is in wide availability and wide use, show that a less than 0.3% rate of significant [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=178.32s)]
*  adverse events from medical abortions involving Mifepristone. So 10%, according to this study, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  but all of the other studies done up until now, 0.3%. Help me understand the discrepancy there. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=191.84s)]
*  How does this one study show such a high number of adverse events? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=198.4s)]
*  Yeah, Katie, I think Mary pointed to it. Well, first of all, that when you actually go to the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=204.56s)]
*  Ethics and Public Policy Center website and try to look for the methodology and including the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  databases from which they extracted it from, you don't have the kind of transparency that we're [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=213.84s)]
*  used to seeing in peer-reviewed journals, for example, where those studies that cited the 0.3% [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=218.4s)]
*  that you mentioned, Katie, actually do have the transparency in the data sources methodology. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=223.36s)]
*  So that's one huge gaping difference that I saw as a health services researcher looking at these [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=228.0s)]
*  reports. And I should say calling it a study is a misnomer because a study is done with hypothesis, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=234.32s)]
*  methodological rigor, and again, transparency, as I mentioned, and the analysis that we're [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=241.36s)]
*  discussing that conveniently popped up about a month ago in time for potentially some sort of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=248.16s)]
*  change at the FDA is far from any of the decades of research, including, by the way, this has been [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=253.44s)]
*  a drug that has been under pretty strict prescribing guidance. What's considered some of the highest [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=259.68s)]
*  standards for database requirements when I would write a prescription, there was a detailed [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=266.08s)]
*  accuracy and account that I had to submit in order to give with that prescription in order to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=272.08s)]
*  create this decades of research that this is safe and effective. And so I do think that the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  discrepancy, Katie, just reduces to, I would like to say, political convenience, but also it goes [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=282.0s)]
*  against what even the Supreme Court has heard in terms of arguments around Miffl-Pristone and the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=288.23999999999995s)]
*  scientific basis for which some of the most recent Supreme Court posturing to try to take down the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=293.2s)]
*  Miffl-Pristone prescribing access has been. This, combined with the Medicaid cuts that we're seeing [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  in the budget bill that's going forward, is troubling, not just for reproductive access, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=305.92s)]
*  but for women's health access overall. There's women's health. There's also overall health that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  is now potentially at risk. We talk a lot about how RFK Jr. wants to make the country healthier [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=315.36s)]
*  again, but a lot of the moves that are being made behind the scenes aren't enforcing that, aren't [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=320.72s)]
*  achieving that. There was proposed regulation that would have prevented illness by reducing [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  the presence of salmonella. And that is top of mind because whenever there is a recall of lettuce [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=334.0s)]
*  or of some food product, it's pretty widely publicized. Hey, don't eat this thing or be [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=342.24s)]
*  careful of this thing or if you have this thing, send it back. There was a nine-year-old boy in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=347.92s)]
*  Indiana who was hospitalized last November from an E. coli outbreak that the FDA did not publicize. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=353.68s)]
*  Now, this is back in November. It's during the Biden administration still. So, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  why is it something that we need to be concerned about now? So, this happened back in November. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=367.28s)]
*  Why didn't this information get publicized, Dr. Patel? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=372.32s)]
*  Right. I think that's exactly what the recent Washington Post reporting, as well as the number [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=378.56s)]
*  of other people even on social media have been calling for, the Center for Science and Public [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=382.96s)]
*  Integrity. There are a number of organizations, nonprofit organizations that have been trying to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=386.96s)]
*  understand. And as you mentioned, Katie, just to be clear, that the incident and the events and the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  E. coli and unfortunately what has happened to not just this one child but likely to many other [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=396.64s)]
*  individuals who don't even realize it was E. coli that was the source of potentially the food [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=401.76s)]
*  poisoning, unfortunately, this is not something that has gone away. And this administration has [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=405.67999999999995s)]
*  to deal with it. Number one, there has been back and forth reporting around this current [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=411.28s)]
*  administration's reduction in food inspection workforce. That's something that just as of today, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  the FDA commissioner tweeted that that is not the case, but we still don't have an accurate [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=421.67999999999995s)]
*  count of which FDA workforce on food inspections have or have not been decreased. Number two, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=426.4s)]
*  I think, Katie, anytime there's something, even if it's in the past, it's an opportunity to educate [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=433.67999999999995s)]
*  and understand what we need to do to fortify the future. We have not necessarily seen that [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=437.68s)]
*  same level of intensity as we have seen just around the topic we're discussing now, Nipah [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=441.92s)]
*  Pristone or another topic, calc powder, which is also a very important, all of these are very [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=445.92s)]
*  important safety topics, but the evidence around E. coli far outweighs any of the evidence around [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=451.2s)]
*  adverse events for Nipah Pristone, for example. So I think you're watching not just the food and drug [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=456.88s)]
*  administration, but the, I think that you're seeing other parts of HHS being used to kind [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=462.08s)]
*  of promote something that doesn't necessarily make America healthier again. It's making us thicker. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=469.76s)]
*  Maybe political priorities over actual health priorities, maybe. Dr. Kavita Patel, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  thank you so much. Mary Ziegler, thank you as well. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3FOLQDtq0&t=478.88s)]
