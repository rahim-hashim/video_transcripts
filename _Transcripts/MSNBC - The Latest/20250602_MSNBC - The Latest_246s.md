**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk)

*  Repairs of the Breach, leading a demonstration against Republican spending plan, what the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=6.16s)]
*  group calls the largest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in U.S. history. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=11.52s)]
*  The Reverend William Barber speaking out in front of the Supreme Court earlier, where [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=17.5s)]
*  we also spoke to a rally goer. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=21.3s)]
*  They have passed a big, ugly, deadly budget bill. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=24.96s)]
*  And they don't want it talked about in public. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=30.48s)]
*  Now every senator is going to have to decide whether they're going to vote for the we're [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=35.08s)]
*  all going to just die approach to politics. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=39.64s)]
*  We're going to keep the pressure on and we're going to keep speaking out and speaking up. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=43.72s)]
*  People are angry and they want to stand up and say not anymore. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=47.36s)]
*  Joining us now is the Reverend Casimir Brown, executive director of Repairs of the Breach. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=51.92s)]
*  Thanks for being with us. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=56.84s)]
*  Your organization says this is a budget that destroys people. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=58.28s)]
*  You're not mincing words. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=62.24s)]
*  What are the potential impacts you're most concerned about and you want people to know [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=64.16s)]
*  about? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=67.76s)]
*  Thank you so much, Chris, for having me. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=68.76s)]
*  We need a moral budget being passed right now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  We are in a moral crisis because what we're seeing is cuts to Medicaid, cuts to SNAP, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=75.72s)]
*  cuts that are going to impact access to safe and secure housing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  We're seeing an increase in spending on the building of family deportation centers, detention [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  centers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=92.68s)]
*  What we need from this Congress is to pass a moral budget, one that is for the people. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=93.68s)]
*  You heard what Republican Senator Joni Ernst said when she was confronted over Medicaid [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=100.04s)]
*  cuts and she is one of the Republicans who argues, and this has been a main argument, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  What they're really doing here is saving Medicaid, that it's not sustainable at the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=109.44s)]
*  levels it's at right now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  What's your answer to that? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=115.12s)]
*  What we know saves people is access to health care, looking at health care as being a human [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=117.52s)]
*  right, not something that only a privileged few get. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=123.2s)]
*  We're seeing that the cuts for Medicaid will impact over 13 million people. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=126.32s)]
*  That's 13 million people without health care. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=131.32s)]
*  We're also seeing that SNAP is being cut as well, affecting over 11 million people. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=134.4s)]
*  Hungry mouths, literally, because they are forcing the brunt of it, the budget being [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=140.08s)]
*  placed on the states instead of they actually being able to do what is right and have the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=146.24s)]
*  money given to the states so they can allocate the food assistance that's needed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=151.4s)]
*  So what I would say to that is we know what is right by the people. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=155.36s)]
*  What's right is actually giving food to people on their tables. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=158.76s)]
*  What is right is making sure that they have access to health care. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=161.24s)]
*  What is right is not ripping families apart. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=164.18s)]
*  And we know they can do that by passing a moral budget. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=166.62s)]
*  But have you seen anything, and I know that you've been working hard on this cause, you're [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=170.38s)]
*  surrounded by people who have dedicated themselves to this cause, are you seeing indications [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=174.34s)]
*  that this kind of constituent pressure is having an impact on lawmakers? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=179.46s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=184.58s)]
*  What we have is a moral fusion coalition. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=185.58s)]
*  And that's just another way of saying that we have people from across the country, across [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=189.18s)]
*  faith backgrounds and non-faith backgrounds, across political divides, because we are a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=193.7s)]
*  nonpartisan movement. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=198.17999999999998s)]
*  We have people from different geographic locations and races. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  And so we have a moral coalition saying we are raising our voices up for too many people [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=204.5s)]
*  who are often pushed aside and silenced. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=210.34s)]
*  We are raising our voices up for justice. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=213.42s)]
*  We know that when we continue to apply that pressure, that things do change. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=216.29999999999998s)]
*  And this is one step closer to doing what is right for the people. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=220.22s)]
*  Reverend Casimir Brown, thank you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4elB5Pgzfk&t=224.3s)]
