Video Description: MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell details how Donald Trump’s “breathtakingly cold statement” about kids getting fewer dolls for Christmas is the clearest thing he has said about “how incapable he is of serving the needs of anyone in America, including children who can now understand how stupid and incompetent their president is.”

# Lawrence: Donny 2 Dolls Trump's cruelty ignores little girl who asked him to 'make Barbies cheaper'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc)
*  Good evening. I'm Lawrence O'Donnell and welcome to the next 100 days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=0.0s)]
*  It was a very bad day in the presidency of Donald Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=5.0s)]
*  Donald Trump had to get rid of the first big player in this White House that he has had to get rid of. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=10.5s)]
*  That was today and today. A federal judge appointed by Donald Trump ruled against Donald Trump. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=17.5s)]
*  It's a turning point. We are at a turning point. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=25.5s)]
*  Heck of a job Brownie. That was a turning point for George W. Bush. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=29.5s)]
*  When President Bush said that to his FEMA director in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=35.5s)]
*  everyone knew that Brownie wasn't doing a heck of a job and the Bush administration's response to that disaster was in itself a disaster. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=41.0s)]
*  And that was a turning point in the perception of the competence of the Bush administration. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=49.5s)]
*  Donnie Two-Dolls arrived at what might be the most memorable turning point in his presidency [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=56.5s)]
*  when he himself expressed the damage his tariffs are doing in terms that any child in America could understand, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=65.5s)]
*  especially a girl hoping for a Barbie for Christmas. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=75.5s)]
*  What Donald Trump said about that yesterday became the lead story on this program last night and went viral today. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=81.5s)]
*  And today Donnie Two-Dolls used the furor created by the stupidest thing ever said about Christmas by a president of any country [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=88.5s)]
*  to mask the first firing in the second Trump White House last night on this program. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=98.5s)]
*  With the generous approval of David Chase, the brilliant creator of the Emmy-winning HBO series The Sopranos, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=106.5s)]
*  I suggested the possible nickname Donald Trump would have if he were a character on The Sopranos. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=113.5s)]
*  And I suggested that that nickname should be Donnie Two-Dolls after he said this yesterday. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=119.5s)]
*  Somebody said, oh, the shelves are going to be open. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=128.5s)]
*  Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=131.5s)]
*  and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=135.5s)]
*  After I made the Donald Trump's Two-Dolls theory of Christmas the lead story on this program last night, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=141.5s)]
*  called him Donnie Two-Dolls to both prove the intellectual rot of the Trump tariff scheme [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=148.5s)]
*  and how Donald Trump is now pushing voters away from him, pushing supporters away from him with scrooge-like comments. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=155.5s)]
*  Donald Trump's favorite hometown newspaper, The New York Post, the newspaper owned by Donald Trump's billionaire friend [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=165.5s)]
*  Ruben Murdoch, the newspaper that has always treated Donald Trump favorably as a gossip item before he got into politics, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=172.5s)]
*  agreed with me that the two dolls was the most important thing Donald Trump said yesterday. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=178.5s)]
*  And Donnie Two-Dolls woke up to find this as the cover of today's New York Post skimp on the Barbie. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=185.5s)]
*  Trump admits tariffs will raise prices, cause shortages. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=194.5s)]
*  It's that simple. And it's on the front page, the cover of a pro-Trump newspaper. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=201.5s)]
*  Anyone can understand that. Any child who might have seen that cover of the New York Post today could understand that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=208.5s)]
*  That is a right-wing Republican newspaper. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=216.5s)]
*  And even that Trump supporting newspaper knows how stupid and politically disastrous it was for Donald Trump to turn himself into Donnie Two-Dolls yesterday. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=219.5s)]
*  That phrase went out there in the world today. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=229.5s)]
*  Protesters were using it on their placards. I think we have some shots of this that we can show you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=233.5s)]
*  There's one from Manhattan today. Protesters out there against Donald Trump. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=239.5s)]
*  Others from other places in the country today dumped Donnie Two-Dolls. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=244.5s)]
*  It really moved because it is so easy to understand. It is just so simple. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=250.5s)]
*  And so Donald Trump chose today to make the biggest change in the White House staff since Inauguration Day, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=258.5s)]
*  hoping that the disaster at the core of that story about Donnie Two-Dolls could be muted. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=265.5s)]
*  He might be able to mute the story that he was creating for himself today. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=273.5s)]
*  Today, Mike Walz set a record for Donald Trump's first choice for national security adviser. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=279.5s)]
*  Mike Walz made it all the way to the 101st day of the Trump presidency before being removed from that position. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=286.5s)]
*  The man who says he always chooses the right people, the best people, got rid of his national security adviser, Mike Walz, on the 101st day of service, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=295.5s)]
*  which means that Mike Walz served four times as long as Donald Trump's first choice of national security adviser in the first Trump White House. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=304.5s)]
*  Michael Flynn served 22 days as national security adviser in Donald Trump's first White House before Donald Trump fired him [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=314.5s)]
*  and before Michael Flynn then went on to become a convicted criminal who Donald Trump then pardoned. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=320.5s)]
*  So if Donald Trump chooses you for national security adviser and your first name is Michael, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=325.5s)]
*  you are going to be the first person he fires in a Trump White House. He has a perfect record on that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=331.5s)]
*  The removal of Mike Walz was, like most Trumpian moves, not carefully planned. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=337.5s)]
*  The carefully planned version of such a move includes the immediate announcement of an impressive choice to be the next national security adviser, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=343.5s)]
*  preferably someone who is seen more favorably than the one who's getting kicked out. But Donald Trump had no one. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=351.5s)]
*  That's a turning point, too. Donald Trump had no one today to put into that job. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=358.5s)]
*  The most important job in the White House after president and vice president. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=364.5s)]
*  Today, Donald Trump needed a new national security adviser, and he couldn't find one. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=369.5s)]
*  So he made Secretary of State Marco Rubio the acting national security adviser. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=375.5s)]
*  Mike Walz was removed from that job after organizing a group chat that included the CIA director, the director of national intelligence, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=380.5s)]
*  the secretary of state, the secretary of defense and others to make sure that everyone was informed [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=389.5s)]
*  and in some cases over informed about an air attack that the United States was about to launch in Yemen. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=396.5s)]
*  One of the people Mike Walz included in that group chat, not on secure technology, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=402.5s)]
*  was the editor in chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, who wrote all about it, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=409.5s)]
*  exposing the single biggest security breach by a national security adviser in history. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=414.5s)]
*  Every participant in that group chat had a professional responsibility to check the list of everyone else they saw on that group chat [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=420.5s)]
*  to make sure that it was safe. But the CIA director didn't do that. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=430.5s)]
*  The incompetent director of national intelligence didn't do that. The incompetent secretary of state didn't do that. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=435.5s)]
*  The incompetent secretary of defense didn't do that and shared battle plans. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=441.5s)]
*  None of them, none of them fulfilled their security responsibility in that group chat on an unsecure platform. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=446.5s)]
*  So they all exhibited rank incompetence in their jobs just by participating in a group chat over that non-secure forum. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=454.5s)]
*  But it was Mike Walz's phone that specifically linked Jeffrey Goldberg into the conversation [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=462.5s)]
*  and in any sane White House, Mike Walz would have been fired as soon as that was discovered. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=467.5s)]
*  Donald Trump decided to give Mike Walz an exit parachute today, but might not be easy to operate because it includes Senate confirmation. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=473.5s)]
*  Donald Trump intends to nominate Mike Walz to be ambassador to the United Nations, which requires Senate confirmation. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=484.5s)]
*  Donald Trump already dropped his first choice for ambassador to the United Nations, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=490.5s)]
*  Congresswoman Elise Stefanik after the speaker of the House panicked about losing another Republican member to the House of Representatives to the Trump administration. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=494.5s)]
*  So Donald Trump's first choice for national security adviser has become his second choice for UN ambassador [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=501.5s)]
*  and will be answering questions under oath in a Senate confirmation hearing about the not secure group chat [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=508.5s)]
*  that he set up to discuss specific times and targets of a battle plan, the kind of information that has always been classified since the invention of classified information. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=515.5s)]
*  Mike Walz's defense under oath in his confirmation hearing will probably be what they've been saying up to now, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=527.5s)]
*  which is that the battle plan wasn't classified, which is the single worst defense anyone could possibly suggest in a case like this, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=536.5s)]
*  acceptable only in Trump world, which means Republican senators will likely be shaming themselves once again and accepting this unique definition of classified [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=548.5s)]
*  and in this case, accepting the dangerous incompetence of Donald Trump's so-called best people. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=559.5s)]
*  Mike Walz's Senate confirmation hearing will give Democrats an opportunity once again to highlight the startling and dangerous incompetence of Donald Trump [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=566.5s)]
*  and his national security adviser and his director of the CIA, his director of national intelligence, his secretary of state, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=575.5s)]
*  who is also now the acting national security adviser and his spectacularly incompetent secretary of defense who shared the actual specifics of the battle plan [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=583.5s)]
*  on that crazy group chat that they had. The childish incompetence of that Trump national security team will be on display in Mike Walz's confirmation hearing [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=596.5s)]
*  and American voters will have no problem understanding it because it is so simple. High school kids will have no problem understanding [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=609.5s)]
*  how stupid and incompetent you have to be to have your group chat leak publicly. The Trump presidency is sinking. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=618.5s)]
*  The cruelty will continue. He will continue to try to deport children who are American citizens. He will continue to try to imprison in El Salvador people who have committed no crimes. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=629.5s)]
*  He will publicly revel in his cruelty to people for whom Trump voters have shown very little sympathy. That will continue. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=639.5s)]
*  But so much of the rest of what Donald Trump is trying to do is sinking. The Trump voters who have showed up at rallies, which is a very tiny percentage of Trump voters, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=649.5s)]
*  have always shown sympathy for themselves. They have always shared in Donald Trump's self-pity when Donald Trump would stand at his rallies and whine and complain about how badly he has been treated [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=659.5s)]
*  after he arrived at that rally on his private plane whose fuel and maintenance was paid for by their campaign contributions. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=671.5s)]
*  Donald Trump knows how to feel sorry for himself. He's very good at that. And the people at Trump rallies who spoke to reporters seem to be very good at that too. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=680.5s)]
*  But remember, about 99% of Trump voters have never been to a Trump rally. Donald Trump does enjoy sounding cruel. Donald Trump enjoys sounding threatening. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=690.5s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to scare his opponents and he wants to scare any of his political allies in the Republican Party who might ever think of disagreeing with him. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=700.5s)]
*  The cruelty is not an act. It is one of Donald Trump's genuine, deeply held qualities. It takes unspeakable cruelty. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=708.5s)]
*  For a president of the United States to take the food away from starving children in Africa in the middle of a famine as Donald Trump and Elon Musk have done. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=719.5s)]
*  Donald Trump took food away from starving mothers in famine in Sudan, from grandmothers, from grandfathers, hungry children watching their siblings starve to death because of Donald Trump. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=728.5s)]
*  And Donald Trump decided they don't need any more food from us, even though the United States of America for the entirety of Donald Trump's life and before that has produced much more food than we can consume in this country. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=741.5s)]
*  The farmers who produced that food that the United States Agency for International Development was using to feed starving children in Africa were all paid in full for that food. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=756.5s)]
*  The federal government paid American farmers for that food that the American government then delivered to starving children and it was as tiny a budget item as exists in the federal government. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=768.5s)]
*  And only the cold cruelty of Donald Trump could take that food away. No other president ever contemplated such a thing. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=779.5s)]
*  No matter how negatively someone might think of the overall record of Republican President George W. Bush, he was as caring and kind and yes, Christian as any president has ever been when trying to help save lives of the poorest people in the world. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=788.5s)]
*  President George W. Bush did more to save the lives of people dying of AIDS in Africa than any other president and in doing so, George W. Bush was following not just good governing policy, not just smart international relations, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=803.5s)]
*  and not just principled altruism, he was following the Christian teachings that he actually believed about loving thy neighbor, about how we treat, as the Bible put it, the least among us. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=816.5s)]
*  The most behaviorally and philosophically un-Christian president in history today at the White House after becoming Donnie Two Dolls yesterday participated in a national day of prayer without ever having been able to publicly recite a prayer in his life from memory. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=833.5s)]
*  Donald Trump embodies cruelty, not Christianity. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=853.5s)]
*  Donald Trump cannot hide the cruelty and cannot control the cruelty and that is why when he was asked about the fact that 80% of the toys sold in this country come from China and 90% of all Christmas products come from China, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=858.5s)]
*  Donald Trump couldn't find words that would express any sympathy for anyone, for any child who might not get that toy that they were dreaming about on Christmas Day because of Donald Trump. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=871.5s)]
*  So Donnie Two Dolls said, well maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=887.5s)]
*  That's the sound of a cruel billionaire, that's the sound of someone rich enough to think that 30 dolls under the tree is a common experience for children in America. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=897.5s)]
*  And that's a billionaire mean enough to think that everyone should just calm down and follow his advice at how many dolls should be under a Christmas tree. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=907.5s)]
*  But Donnie Two Dolls breathtakingly cold statement about the children of America is the clearest thing he has said to Americans and to Trump supporters about how lost he is, about how incapable he is of serving the needs of anyone in America, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=915.5s)]
*  including children who can now understand how stupid and incompetent their president is, including children who came out to support Donald Trump during the presidential campaign. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=933.5s)]
*  Campaign reporters sometimes have to do some gimmicky things, sometimes their producers want them to do things like interview the kids at the campaign rally. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=945.5s)]
*  NBC's Shaq Brewster is as good as it gets on the campaign trail, and he has conducted many important interviews during campaigns and during important breaking news events in this country. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=954.5s)]
*  He has appeared on this program repeatedly during some of those breaking news events. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=967.5s)]
*  And last September at a Trump rally, Shaq Brewster conducted an interview that was fun. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=971.5s)]
*  You can tell how much fun Shaq Brewster had. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=977.5s)]
*  You can tell how he's enjoying talking to these two Trump supporters. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=980.5s)]
*  One thing you're not expecting in an interview with children at a campaign rally is anything substantive. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=984.5s)]
*  But Shaq Brewster's interview with two young girls in Michigan in September stands tonight as possibly the most important campaign rally interview conducted by anyone in that campaign because it shows precisely what Trump supporters expected of Donald Trump. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=992.5s)]
*  And it shows precisely how clear it is and how clear it can be to Trump supporters now. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1013.5s)]
*  What a total failure Donald Trump has become to them. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1021.5s)]
*  Two wonderful young girls at a Trump rally named Stella and Maeve with the full support and approval of their father asked to be interviewed by Shaq Brewster. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1027.5s)]
*  They asked for that moment in front of a TV camera. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1040.5s)]
*  And we are so lucky tonight that they did ask to be interviewed and that Shaq Brewster had the good grace to do it. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1044.5s)]
*  And importantly, as you'll see, the skill to recognize that there was actually some real substance to be gained in this interview of children at a campaign rally. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1051.5s)]
*  What you're about to see is the full range of the age of Americans who can understand exactly how Donald Trump's tariffs work against them. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1063.5s)]
*  Here is the campaign interview that deserves to be seen by every American of every age. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1077.5s)]
*  What do you want him to do? What do you want him to say today? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1093.5s)]
*  I want him to lower prices and lower the taxes and make Barbies cheaper. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1098.5s)]
*  Make Barbies cheaper? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1109.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1110.5s)]
*  Tell me more about that. Have they gotten expensive? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1111.5s)]
*  Yeah. And Polly Pockets. All my favorite toys are so expensive. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1113.5s)]
*  Barbies cheaper. It just doesn't get simpler than that. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1120.5s)]
*  It doesn't get easier to understand than that. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1125.5s)]
*  That is a simple request. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1129.5s)]
*  And Donnie Tudel said yesterday he is sure that the parents of young girls hoping for a Barbie won't mind paying, as he put it, a couple of bucks more. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1132.5s)]
*  Barbie has made billions upon billions of dollars for Americans over the course of the life of that remarkable doll. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1142.5s)]
*  And recently Barbie made even more billions of dollars for Americans by becoming a movie character. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1152.5s)]
*  And not a single Barbie in history that most American of dolls has ever been made in the United States of America, not one. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1161.5s)]
*  But Barbie has managed to make Americans richer in many ways. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1172.5s)]
*  And the vast fortunes made on Barbie are American fortunes. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1178.5s)]
*  And because Donald Trump doesn't understand economics and because Donald Trump doesn't understand the huge value of international trade and because Donald Trump doesn't understand little girls, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1184.5s)]
*  Donald Trump thinks Barbie is an enemy of America because Barbie is not made here. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1194.5s)]
*  That's how much Donald Trump doesn't understand about America. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1202.5s)]
*  That's how much Donald Trump doesn't understand about what a real enemy is. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1207.5s)]
*  He thinks Barbie is an enemy. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1212.5s)]
*  That's how much Donald Trump doesn't understand about his youngest supporters and the fathers and the mothers of those youngest supporters who were really hoping and believing that he would make Barbies cheaper. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1215.5s)]
*  It doesn't get simpler. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1231.5s)]
*  The obvious failure of Donald Trump does not get simpler. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1233.5s)]
*  The New York Times picked up today on Donnie Tudel's cold comments about the Tudel limit he wants to see under Christmas trees. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1238.5s)]
*  The Times reports, this grinchy pronouncement by the president had the value of being truthful. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1247.5s)]
*  Many American toy makers and retailers have started to pause their orders as the effects of Mr. Trump's tariffs ripple out, threatening to snarl supply chains. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1253.5s)]
*  It could all have a big impact on this year's holiday season since it takes months to manufacture, package and ship many products to the United States. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1264.5s)]
*  The Independent reports, quote, in a toy association survey of 410 small and medium sized toy manufacturers taken this month, 64 percent of small toy companies and 80 percent of mid-sized toy companies said they have canceled orders. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1273.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, roughly half said they would go out of business within weeks or months if U.S. tariffs on China remained in place. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1288.5s)]
*  Jennifer Bergman, the owner of Westside Kids in New York City, told the New York Times, quote, that she would try to buy as much as she could now, but that the shortages were already starting. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1299.5s)]
*  As for the tariffs remain, Christmas will be like something we've never experienced before. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1311.5s)]
*  Ms. Bergman said, people will be standing in line to buy things that cost twice or three times as much as before. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1317.5s)]
*  She said her business is already under pressure from competition by Amazon, but she fears that the tariffs will deliver a final blow. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1326.5s)]
*  I will be in business for Christmas, said Ms. Bergman, who added that she was consulting a bankruptcy lawyer. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1334.5s)]
*  The most expensive product the United States of America has ever exported in history is a Boeing commercial airliner. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1343.5s)]
*  That's the most expensive object in the world. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1355.5s)]
*  And international orders for Boeing commercial airliners now face the possibility of being canceled, which could ultimately drive Boeing out of business thanks to Donald Trump's tariffs. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1359.5s)]
*  We used to have several manufacturers of commercial airliners in the United States. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1370.5s)]
*  Then we got down to three. Then we get down to two. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1374.5s)]
*  And we have been at one for a long time now. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1377.5s)]
*  And Donald Trump could be the president who loses that one. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1380.5s)]
*  And then we become the country that manufactures zero commercial airliners. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1385.5s)]
*  The Trump tariffs could do that. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1392.5s)]
*  But if you're a little girl who doesn't know anything about the cost of that airplane that you're flying on to on Christmas vacation. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1394.5s)]
*  You understand the price of Barbies. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1403.5s)]
*  General Motors announced today that the Trump tariffs will wipe out about a fourth of the profit of America's biggest car company. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1407.5s)]
*  What they were hoping for this year. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1415.5s)]
*  And if you're a little girl who doesn't understand what General Motors is, doesn't understand that your car, your family car is a General Motors car, you understand the price of Barbies. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1417.5s)]
*  And that's a big problem for Donald Trump. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1428.5s)]
*  That everyone at every age now is learning the hard way about what Donald Trump is doing to prices. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1430.5s)]
*  Children can learn this now. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1440.5s)]
*  A Barbie that cost twenty dollars last Christmas could cost, will cost fifty dollars this Christmas, at least unless Donald Trump surrenders in his trade war with China. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1443.5s)]
*  And that price rise is not, as Donald Trump put it, a couple of bucks. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1458.5s)]
*  It's one hundred and fifty percent. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1463.5s)]
*  That's his tariff. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1465.5s)]
*  One hundred and forty five percent on Barbies from China. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1467.5s)]
*  It cost fifty dollars this month. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1472.5s)]
*  If you can get a Barbie, if you'll be able to get one, if the shortages don't hit in the toy store in the day you're going in there. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1476.5s)]
*  That's not a couple of bucks more. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1485.5s)]
*  No. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1488.5s)]
*  Donnie Tudel doesn't understand what he's doing. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1491.5s)]
*  He has no idea what he's doing. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1494.5s)]
*  He has never understood tariffs. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1497.5s)]
*  And now little girls in America know that Donald Trump doesn't know what he's doing. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1499.5s)]
*  Even they know. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1504.5s)]
*  Everyone knows. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1505.5s)]
*  This is a turning point. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1507.5s)]
*  Last night, Kamala Harris said this. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1509.5s)]
*  Courage is contagious. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1514.5s)]
*  The courage of Americans who are banding together in the face of the greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1522.5s)]
*  Americans across the political spectrum who are declaring that the president's reckless tariffs hurt workers and families by raising the cost of everyday essentials, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1536.5s)]
*  devastate the retirement accounts that people spent a lifetime paying into, and paralyze American businesses, large and small, forcing them to lay off people, to stop hiring or pause investment decisions. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1554.5s)]
*  I understand why. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1574.5s)]
*  And it's certainly true of those tariffs. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1576.5s)]
*  Tariffs that, as I predicted, are clearly inviting a recession. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1580.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_BJisSuBc&t=1610.5s)]
