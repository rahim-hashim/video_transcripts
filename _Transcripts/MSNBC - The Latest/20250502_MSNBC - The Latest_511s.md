# 'Never seen anybody this incompetent': Sen. Warner says Hegseth is the 'worst' Defense Secretary
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE)
*  President Trump may have just plucked Mike Waltz out of the frying pan and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=0.0s)]
*  thrown him straight into the fire. After Democrats clamored for and were denied [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=4.16s)]
*  an investigation and hearing into Signalgate, Waltz's nomination to be US [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=8.88s)]
*  ambassador to the UN may give them the opportunity they've wanted. So how will [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=13.48s)]
*  they use it? Our next guest says he expects it to get pretty brutal. I want [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=19.2s)]
*  to bring in Democratic Senator Mark Warner, vice chair of the Senate [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=24.2s)]
*  Intelligence Committee. It's always good to see you, Senator. I mean, we know [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=27.46s)]
*  that a confirmation hearing hasn't been scheduled yet, but you did say you [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=30.98s)]
*  thought it could be brutal. How? What are you looking for? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=34.620000000000005s)]
*  Well, how are these incredibly sloppy protocols around secure information [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=38.96s)]
*  being allowed to take place? And we heard on Mr Waltz that he had done not [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=47.3s)]
*  simply one of these, the famous Signalgate chat, but that there were up [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=53.3s)]
*  to 20 other chats. We still don't even know, Chris, whether the devices used [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=57.98s)]
*  have ever been scanned for malware. I mean, that's, you know, basic security [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=64.3s)]
*  101. And people are, I can tell you this, people in the military and in the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=69.7s)]
*  intelligence community are pissed off because they know if they had done any [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=75.25999999999999s)]
*  of this activity, they would absolutely be fired. I will give Waltz credit that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=80.02s)]
*  he acknowledged that there was a mistake. He at least had the, I think the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=84.82s)]
*  good sense there. Candidly, I'm glad we're going to have this chance to get [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=88.61999999999999s)]
*  to how this took place. But the real damage and the place where the person [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=95.06s)]
*  that desperately needs to go is Pete Excev. He doesn't even have the excuse [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  that it was only receiving your government officials. He took that same [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=105.14s)]
*  information and put it on a SignalChat with his wife, his brother, his lawyer, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=108.42s)]
*  by the way, why are they on DOD payroll to start with? And I've dared him to come [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  down. He says no bad information to come down to Norfolk, Virginia, which is the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=120.3s)]
*  home port of the Truman. The Truman was the aircraft carrier that launched these [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=125.26s)]
*  jets against the hoodies and explained to the friends and the families of the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=130.1s)]
*  sailors on that ship how that information if it had gotten in the wrong hands [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=134.38s)]
*  wouldn't have been potentially deadly to those sailors. So, you know, I think [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=138.78s)]
*  Waltz will go through this. Hegev is an extraordinarily worse secretary. I've [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=143.98s)]
*  never seen anybody this incompetent. And there is not a day, Chris, that goes by [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=150.5s)]
*  that I don't hear from the military or from the intelligence community that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=155.1s)]
*  their morale is deteriorating because this kind of behavior is going on from [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=159.26s)]
*  Hegev from Waltz. I got to throw Tulsi Gabbard in there as well. There's never [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=163.74s)]
*  been a director of the National Intelligence that almost on a daily basis [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=167.74s)]
*  condemns the intelligence workforce and calls them out somehow as all deep state [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=172.06s)]
*  individuals. These kind of actions across this national security group in [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=177.3s)]
*  Trump administration is making our nation less safe. And I think Waltz will [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=182.78s)]
*  have to provide answers. And I'm glad he's out of that position. But boy, oh, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=187.78s)]
*  boy, I'm not going to rest until Hegev. And I also think Tulsi Gabbard are [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=192.98000000000002s)]
*  removed from their positions as well because they are undermining, you know, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=198.10000000000002s)]
*  the security of our military, our intelligence forces and are frankly [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  destroying confidence of our allies that we can keep any kind of secret safe. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  So if indeed, Senator, folks are ticked off and they want to get to the bottom of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=211.58s)]
*  this, what's the plan? Have you talked to members of the committee and how [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=215.3s)]
*  they're going to go about this? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=219.94s)]
*  Yeah, this all happened yesterday afternoon. I've had a couple of one off [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=221.86s)]
*  conversations. I'm sure the committee will do an important job. I'm going to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=226.58s)]
*  make sure that we don't just talk or I hope they will not just talk about the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  actual contents of the signal scam. But how would this allow in the first place? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=235.82s)]
*  Waltz has acknowledged 20 other such chats who are on those chats. And again, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=243.70000000000002s)]
*  not to sound and nerd out, but, you know, security 101. Have these phones been [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=249.17999999999998s)]
*  checked for malware? You know, you can find all of these folks' numbers on the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=255.1s)]
*  web. If the Chinese or the Russians who have broken into our systems, who have [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=260.5s)]
*  targeted even encrypted systems like Signal, if they can implant malware, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=265.7s)]
*  even if they don't have physical possession of the phone. So the fact that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=273.38s)]
*  we've not even got an answer on that shows the kind of casual attitude this [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=277.94s)]
*  administration has towards classified information. And I can just tell you [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=282.26s)]
*  firsthand, allies I've heard from, not just NATO, but for example, Israel were [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=286.26s)]
*  aghast that this kind of information is out there. And the problem is, Chris, if [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=292.86s)]
*  they stop sharing with us, we won't really know because, you know, you don't [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=297.74s)]
*  know what they actually had. But I do know there is a thorough review going on [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=301.82s)]
*  amongst many of our allies about whether their trusted secrets can still be [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=308.58s)]
*  shared with us. That is a awful position and something that in literally 100 days [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=313.74s)]
*  this administration has created that I never thought I'd see in my lifetime. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=319.46s)]
*  Well, that brings me to ask you about how all this affects your former [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=323.18s)]
*  colleague Marco Rubio. Now, on top of being Secretary of State, he is the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=326.18s)]
*  Interim National Security Advisor, Acting Administrator of USAID, Acting Archivist [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=330.3s)]
*  for the National Archives. You voted to confirm him as Secretary of State. Let's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=336.3s)]
*  just say it's a big job. Now adding three more onto his plate. What questions do [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=341.26s)]
*  you have about how the work of diplomacy and national security are being carried [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=348.62s)]
*  out right now? Listen, I worked well with Marco during our tenure when I was [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=352.74s)]
*  chair and he was vice chair of the Intelligence Committee. Candidly, I've been [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=359.66s)]
*  disappointed by, for example, his unwillingness so far to stand up for [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=363.42s)]
*  American soft power, for example, that comes out the USAID. We basically wasted [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=369.78000000000003s)]
*  70 years of trying to work with particularly developing countries. And I [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=375.18s)]
*  can already tell you China has rushed in with pennies on the dollar to fill the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=381.5s)]
*  void. I don't have the foggiest idea how you can be Secretary of State, head of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=386.14s)]
*  USAID and now National Security Advisor. You know, I've met with national [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=392.38s)]
*  security advisors, obviously, Jake, during the Biden administration, but [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=397.78s)]
*  during the first Trump administration, this is a full time job plus. And the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=401.78s)]
*  idea that you can do that national security component and still lead the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=407.09999999999997s)]
*  diplomatic efforts that are frankly being so undermined by the erratic [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=411.98s)]
*  behavior of Trump from the tariffs to basically turning our allies into [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  enemies. I mean, again, who would have ever thought that, you know, Canada has [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=423.34000000000003s)]
*  completely changed their view of the United States and in 100 days of a Trump [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=427.22s)]
*  administration. Um, I still like Marco a lot, respect him, been disappointed by [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=430.86s)]
*  some of his actions, but I don't know how in any kind of rational way you could [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=436.08000000000004s)]
*  do literally two of these jobs little more than the three or four that he's [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=441.86s)]
*  got assigned at this point. And it shows, I think this requirement of grand [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=446.56s)]
*  fidelity to the leader. I mean, you could have looked at that cabinet meeting the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=454.42s)]
*  other day and you could have taken out Donald Trump's image and put in Kim [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=459.18s)]
*  Jong Un from North Korea. And you could have been the same kind of cabinet [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=463.94s)]
*  meeting where everybody has to go around and pledge allegiance to the great [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=468.54s)]
*  leader. Frankly, it was disgusting and unamerican. So the idea that Marco [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=472.62s)]
*  suddenly going to have three or four positions at once. Um, he's got a lot of [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=478.98s)]
*  skills, but no human being can do that. Senator Mark Warner. It's always good to [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=483.70000000000005s)]
*  have you on the show. Thank you. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEdFsNRnIE&t=489.40000000000003s)]
