# 'Closing the war on Putin's terms': Trump's Ukraine peace plan parrots Kremlin talking points
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA)
*  The president said he was going to end the war in Ukraine on day one [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=0.0s)]
*  We're obviously approaching day 100 and he told Time magazine like I really couldn't believe this one [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=4.2s)]
*  He told Time magazine it was an exaggeration and people knew that it was said in jest [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=9.28s)]
*  This is a war. Yeah, this is a war. This is a country that has been at war for years [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=15.48s)]
*  And are we really gonna swallow that I was just kidding [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=21.12s)]
*  I think his supporters do I think the Republicans who have abdicated their responsibility in Congress [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Have I think the rest of the world looks at it and says oh now we're not gonna share information with you anymore now [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  We know we can't trust the United States now [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=35.48s)]
*  We're not going to do national security sharing because it's not just that you failed to solve the war, right? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=37.4s)]
*  It's it was nothing that anyone was going to be able to fix in a month [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=42.76s)]
*  The larger issue is that you have done nothing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=45.28s)]
*  You have allowed Russia to get more aggressive and then you basically try to son and embarrass and emasculate [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=48.08s)]
*  The president of Ukraine when he came to the United States [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=54.5s)]
*  Nobody like that and then you sent your little lapdog JD Vance over to Europe to tell everybody else that they're the old [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=57.7s)]
*  Well, we don't want to work with you anymore. That's where the problem is the humanitarian crisis is clear [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  Russia's doing is terrible people are starving people are dying. We wish this war was over [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=66.74000000000001s)]
*  That's already clear [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=70.58s)]
*  But the policy element of it and the failure on the part of dollar Trump has changed the way [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=71.66s)]
*  America is looked at across the planet and I'll tell you this so I'm a really good friend of mine who left the country [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=76.58s)]
*  Like a lot of people lives in France now, and she said, you know, what's really interesting [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=81.86s)]
*  She's like when I talked to people were out we're hanging out socializing. They asked me if I'm a refugee [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=85.22000000000001s)]
*  They asked what she she said they asked if I am a refugee [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=89.54s)]
*  Are you one of those Americans who's moved here since Trump got back into power because your country is unsafe now? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=93.26s)]
*  And she said that what she often hears and she works in politics when she's just talking to smart people as they say [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=98.7s)]
*  The first time you guys elected him we figured maybe it was kind of a fever dream [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=103.5s)]
*  But now that you've done it again, we know we can't trust you [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=107.18s)]
*  That's the time it wasn't about him this time [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=109.42000000000002s)]
*  We knew exactly who he was and it's about us exactly on the war [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=113.82s)]
*  Vlad the Volodymyr Zelensky is another person who's tougher and stronger than Trump Donald Trump by saying he's going to end the war [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=119.33999999999999s)]
*  he is aligned with Vladimir Putin and he's trying to close the war on Putin's terms and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=126.78s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky is not having that and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=133.62s)]
*  other [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=136.85999999999999s)]
*  Powers our former allies in Europe are not having that so I think he's been [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=138.1s)]
*  That's part of the reason it's not just because wars are difficult [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=143.46s)]
*  It's because he was looking for a particular outcome that he's found it very difficult to achieve [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=146.3s)]
*  Strengthening the NATO alliance was actually one of Joe Biden's strongest achievements [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=152.94s)]
*  He doesn't get a ton of credit for it because foreign policy isn't something that voters focus on but is the lesson learned here? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=157.3s)]
*  Diplomacy is really hard right when you come from real estate. It is here's a one-pager take it or leave it [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=164.62s)]
*  I'm gonna walk away that doesn't work in war. Yeah, not just in Ukraine, but but with Israel [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=170.14s)]
*  Yes, and Trump had a very easy argument in the campaign, which was these wars in Gaza and in in Ukraine [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=175.26s)]
*  We're not happening why I was president true. They weren't they weren't happening was president [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  He did not answer the rest that that that statement that covered that question [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=184.5s)]
*  What are you going to do to end it? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=188.98s)]
*  The glibness with which he's been dealing with this in the last hundred days shows that there was not actually a plan beyond we're going to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=190.62s)]
*  Talk to Russia about giving giving them enough to give Ukraine and the war [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=197.66s)]
*  But this coalition that Trump put together in 2024 [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=201.5s)]
*  It did include millions more people including people who would have voted a third party in the past or don't trust politicians [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=204.46s)]
*  And I was meeting a lot of voters who liked Trump because they believed they believe the day one thing [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=209.54s)]
*  You usually don't run for president saying you'll do something on day one when you don't plan to do it [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=214.0s)]
*  They did believe that Trump had some ability [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  Just that he had to keep prices low before that before kovat that he had some ability to wrap these wars up because he was [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=219.5s)]
*  Tough he he could negotiate across the table frankly [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=224.9s)]
*  He didn't look as old as Joe Biden and Joe Biden look like he get rolled and he couldn't and I have seen this start [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=227.46s)]
*  To break apart some of the coalition the way that you're talking about where the Burstle Justin in [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  In the sort of podcast network [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=236.9s)]
*  I have seen people who took a big bet on Trump were very comfortable saying he's gonna get the peace in Gaza because [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=238.86s)]
*  Netanyahu trust him he's gonna get a peace in Ukraine because he's tough [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  I've seen people with some chagrin not necessarily apologizing for this but saying [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=247.38000000000002s)]
*  Stopping to talk just talk about it and there were there were people who were never for Republican before and I don't think we'll be [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=252.9s)]
*  Republican again [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=257.86s)]
*  They were because they thought Trump had some ability to negotiate and end these wars that did not start in his watch [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=258.54s)]
*  The Gaza part in particular he it's still Democrats were getting protested by people who were calling a genocide etc [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=264.1s)]
*  But there were people who said this was this is going to end. I'm not gonna have to think about it [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=270.54s)]
*  He's going to have some sort of deal [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=273.74s)]
*  There are still bombing happening [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=275.98s)]
*  And there's still this plan that that blew people away the first couple weeks the presidency to just turn it into some sort [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=277.84s)]
*  Of resort that immediately started losing people just in going out and talking to to voters who are not necessarily hard partisans [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=283.32s)]
*  That's where I saw some people saying I took a risk and I do regret it [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=291.44s)]
*  I don't know how the Biden would have fixed it, but certainly he's not going to well those voters that David's talking [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  About are the voters who decide elections. Yeah, when you go from 49 to 40, you're losing people. I agree with you guys [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=299.88s)]
*  He's not losing MAGA people but he's losing voters that he needs and Republicans need to win the soft [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  Republicans the ones who kind of vaguely had a sense about [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=313.76s)]
*  Strength and doing something about inflation those people are drifting away from him [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=317.2s)]
*  But let's talk about p-tag Seth because you brought it up a moment ago things really are [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=322.08s)]
*  Chaotic at the Pentagon. Okay, you've got people getting fired. You've got people quitting [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=327.92s)]
*  You've got top lieutenants who are quitting who are writing scathing op-eds [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=331.8s)]
*  We've got reporters who are telling us it is pure chaos [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=335.2s)]
*  Inside the Pentagon and the thing is well, he might not be at risk of the president sending him packing [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=338.88s)]
*  If an organization it can be the government or business if an unqualified or unpopular or unruly leader [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=346.08s)]
*  Takes charge there it can easily be mutiny from within the rank-and-file [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=353.32s)]
*  Can blow your game up and humiliate you? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=358.6s)]
*  How do you think this is gonna go because as humiliating as this is for Hague Seth [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=362.68s)]
*  He does represent a part of MAGA that really are ride or die for Trump and Trump knows that I [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=367.4s)]
*  Don't see him go anywhere because that's not how this administration operates, right? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=374.44s)]
*  You have to personally offend Donald Trump before he makes you go [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=378.32s)]
*  He can screw up twenty seven different thousand ways [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=382.36s)]
*  But unless Pete Hague says says something that contradicts Donald Trump or someone gets into Trump's ear and says this guy said this thing [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=384.88s)]
*  About you at third period and what if he really embarrasses you? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=391.86s)]
*  What if he just really just blows the way I mean just what if he drives your poll numbers down? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=394.90000000000003s)]
*  That's why I disagree with Jason. I don't think he's long for this world because Donald Trump [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=399.7s)]
*  Yes, personal slights mean a lot to him, but bad press [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=404.98s)]
*  Means a lot to him as well and falling numbers mean a lot to him, but you're the thing. He'll survive it [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=408.78000000000003s)]
*  He'll survive it unless you have some sort of consequence, right? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=413.90000000000003s)]
*  Pete Hague Seth looking like an idiot is very easy for Donald Trump to say Pete Hague Seth looks like an idiot and at some point [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=417.18s)]
*  That sort of attention as long as it's not on him, right? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=422.7s)]
*  We've seen this with Elon Musk Elon Musk is grotesquely unpopular [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=425.5s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't kick him out because it's not him unless it becomes a Donald Trump didn't kick him out because Elon Musk [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=428.86s)]
*  Benefits Trump in that he's happy to be a human heat shield for bad press and his pockets couldn't be deeper [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=435.02s)]
*  He takes that much different story [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=440.9s)]
*  You [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QaaU4KzGA&t=447.18s)]
