# Fmr. Harris campaign advisor: The bottom line on tariffs: 'Trump doesn’t have a plan’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U)
*  Is it okay in the short term to have a recession? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=0.0s)]
*  Look, yeah, everything's okay. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=4.0s)]
*  What we are, I said, this is a transition period. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=8.96s)]
*  Are you worried about a recession? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=11.94s)]
*  No. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=16.04s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=17.04s)]
*  Senate Republicans are growing increasingly nervous about the potential effects of Trump's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=18.04s)]
*  trade war after he suggested that some of his tariffs could be permanent. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=25.52s)]
*  West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito told The Hill, he was elected on the economy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=30.08s)]
*  He's a dealmaker in the economy space, so he has big expectations of himself. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=35.64s)]
*  That America, we don't necessarily have a lot of tolerance for pain. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=41.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump is growing frustrated with reporters asking when to expect major trade [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=45.36s)]
*  deals to be secured after the president previously boasted about how our trade partners were [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=50.2s)]
*  quote, dying to make a deal. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=55.32s)]
*  But in a sign he may be aware of Republicans' anxiety, he's also suggesting that he would [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=58.44s)]
*  be willing to lower tariffs on China to 80% from 145%. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  That would be clear. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=68.84s)]
*  Joining us now to discuss is former senior spokesperson and advisor for the Harris campaign, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=70.16s)]
*  Adrian Elrod and founder of Principles First, Heath Mayo. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=75.4s)]
*  Adrian Heath, welcome to the show. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=80.64s)]
*  Okay, I just want to apologize for my stunned silence when we came out of that sound. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  Shook as the kids call him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=88.44s)]
*  Yes, that's exactly it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  I was shooketh. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  Shooketh. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  The tariffs on China, 145%. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  He says he's going to bring them down to 80%. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=97.36s)]
*  What the entire hell is going on here? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=101.52s)]
*  I think he's hit a whoopsie moment. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=104.56s)]
*  He touched the hot stove and he realized it was hot. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  Aside from the fact that it just doesn't even make any sense to put a lot of pressure on [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=110.96s)]
*  all your allies when the focus has been China, I mean this is really going to hit just the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=114.72s)]
*  basic necessities for a lot of American families. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=119.56s)]
*  You look at strollers and car seats. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=122.08s)]
*  I think we get something like 97% of our car seats from China. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=123.6s)]
*  This is going to mean significant increases for young American families. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=127.52s)]
*  We just had our first in December. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=131.4s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=133.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=134.28s)]
*  The upper baby Vista I saw yesterday is up 300 bucks. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=135.28s)]
*  It's not cheap. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=138.44s)]
*  It's like now 1,200 bucks. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=139.52s)]
*  This is not just iPhones, computers, TVs. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=142.2s)]
*  This is the basic necessities. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=145.6s)]
*  New families that are just starting out, 300 bucks, that's a lot of money. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=147.44s)]
*  People are going to be mad. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=151.84s)]
*  That's a large part of American voters. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=152.92s)]
*  The administration has said they want to be pro-family, but this is going to crush them. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=154.68s)]
*  Politically, it seems like a bad idea. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=158.12s)]
*  When you look at, Adrienne, Donald Trump's ability in the past to speak to people's fears [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=160.24s)]
*  and what they're scared of, he's usually pretty good at it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=166.48s)]
*  He's usually pretty good at reading the room and saying, yeah, you should be scared about [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=169.36s)]
*  that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  We're going to fix it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=176.60000000000002s)]
*  In that interview with Welker, that's not what he was doing whatsoever. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  Talk a little bit about how he might be making some of the mistakes that Joe Biden made, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=181.08s)]
*  which is not fully, at least publicly, understanding how people are feeling about the economy and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  how that is more important than anything else. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=190.68s)]
*  For a couple of things. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=192.56s)]
*  First of all, he made it very clear on the campaign trail that he was going to enact [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=193.56s)]
*  and impose tariffs and raise tariffs. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=196.84s)]
*  That was something that we tried to warn the American people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=198.84s)]
*  We made it very clear if he does this, it's a tax on American families. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=201.96s)]
*  A tariff equals a tax on American families. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=205.56s)]
*  What he has not done so far in this administration is, yes, he's gone forward with the tariffs, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=208.84s)]
*  but he hasn't actually explained to the American people effectively how it's going to work, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=214.28s)]
*  how he thinks it's going to lower their costs in the long run. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=218.08s)]
*  He hasn't explained that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=220.7s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=221.7s)]
*  It's kind of where he's at. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=222.7s)]
*  And by the way, rule 101, whether you're working on a campaign in the White House, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=223.7s)]
*  an agency, wherever you are, is to make sure that you have, when you're rolling out a message, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=228.54s)]
*  when you're rolling out a new policy, you have surrogates out there. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  You've got administration officials out there validating you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=236.06s)]
*  In the sense of tariffs, if he just had a couple of CEOs that were going out and saying, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  you know what, we were briefed on this plan. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=243.73999999999998s)]
*  Here's how we think it's going to be okay. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=245.73999999999998s)]
*  Maybe that would have blunted some of the market chaos, but he didn't do that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=248.67999999999998s)]
*  Because the plan changed everything. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=251.83999999999997s)]
*  Because he doesn't have a plan is the bottom line. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=252.98s)]
*  So very ineffective strategy, to your point. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=255.8s)]
*  I mean, he tried to talk about America first and Americans family first. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=258.48s)]
*  He's just going to raise costs on American families. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=262.96s)]
*  Chaos ensues, and it's not a good strategy for especially people who want to try to retire [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=265.48s)]
*  in the next one to two years. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=269.96s)]
*  But you're a conservative. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=271.88s)]
*  You worked in Republican circles. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=272.88s)]
*  I believe now you don't consider yourself a Republican. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=274.48s)]
*  Yes, but you know the economic Republicans who turn out reliably and vote. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=277.88s)]
*  And they may disagree with other parts of the platform, but they like Republicans in [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  control of the economy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=288.12s)]
*  What is happening right now to that voter and to so many of the members on the Hill, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  which I really can't believe they still are keeping their mouths shut as Trump is basically [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=295.04s)]
*  decimating the American economy and the free market? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=299.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the Republican primary voter is sort of still in lockstep with Trump to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=302.4s)]
*  some degree. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=309.32s)]
*  I mean, there's this gravitational pull that he has politically over the party, and he [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=310.32s)]
*  surrounded himself with yes men that make it difficult to erode that support. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=314.67999999999995s)]
*  But the minute that mom, dad, families go to start to buy these basic necessities and [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=319.0s)]
*  they realize that, hey, why am I paying $400 more for a stroller? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=325.52s)]
*  People are going to start to get frustrated. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=331.04s)]
*  Especially when he promised that that wasn't going to be right. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=332.56s)]
*  And to your point, when he's not able to explain it effectively, like what are we getting out [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=335.44s)]
*  of this? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=339.64000000000004s)]
*  People if they're sitting at home, they're going to start to get pissed off about this [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=340.72s)]
*  because the only reason that there's no reason this is happening other than the fact that [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=343.74s)]
*  the president and the yes men that he has surrounded himself with just simply don't [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=348.16s)]
*  understand the basic economics. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=351.88s)]
*  Trust us. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=353.56s)]
*  Trust us. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=354.56s)]
*  I mean, you have the president saying in that interview with Kristen Welker, oh, well, there [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=355.56s)]
*  will be short term pain. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=359.36s)]
*  You have to, yeah, I mean, it's going to hurt in the short term, but in the long term, trust [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  us, it'll be fine. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  But I remember if a Democrat had said that, oh, don't worry. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  It's going to hurt in the short term. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=371.92s)]
*  They would have been blasted as being out of touch. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=373.44s)]
*  They're out of it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=376.32s)]
*  The American people hate it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=377.32s)]
*  And yet this guy gets away with it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=381.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  I just, he's asking Americans to sacrifice. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=383.40000000000003s)]
*  And I mean, we've asked Americans to sacrifice before. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=385.8s)]
*  Americans can sacrifice during wars if we have a good reason, but not just because Trump [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=388.36s)]
*  woke up this morning and tweeted and had us. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=394.36s)]
*  Can I also just remind everyone he inherited Trump inherited a pretty gosh darn good economy. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=396.76s)]
*  15.5 million jobs created under President Biden for major economic bills, 800,000 manufacturing [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=402.84000000000003s)]
*  jobs. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=408.16s)]
*  The implementation of those economic bills is playing was playing out when it still is [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=409.16s)]
*  to an extent, even though the Trump has caused so much chaos. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  The fact that he inherited this good economy and now he's trying to say, just trust me, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=416.66s)]
*  it's going to be a little difficult for a while, but like, I'm going to get it sorted [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=420.06s)]
*  out. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=423.06s)]
*  Things were not so bad except for inflation. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=424.06s)]
*  That's one of the main reasons why we lost. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=425.06s)]
*  Adrian, Republicans can be made to pay the price for all of this chaos. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=427.58000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=433.42s)]
*  And when this tariffs get bad and people started spending 400 extra dollars, there is a world [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=434.42s)]
*  in which Democrats are able to make Republicans pay at the ballot box for this. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=438.08000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't have any more elections to run, so he don't care. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=441.86s)]
*  But how do Democrats do? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=444.66s)]
*  He's saying, I was just joking. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=446.26s)]
*  But how do Democrats do that? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=451.38s)]
*  You are a strategist, coms maven. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=453.09999999999997s)]
*  How do Democrats actually make this worth their while on the electoral and electoral [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=455.82s)]
*  I'm really glad you mentioned that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=461.3s)]
*  First of all, we've had some electoral successes and some of the special elections that have [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=462.65999999999997s)]
*  taken place. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=466.14s)]
*  Of course, Pennsylvania, the state Senate race there, the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=467.14s)]
*  We're seeing some of these bellwethers special, special elections that are showing that Americans [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=470.38s)]
*  are frustrated. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=474.18s)]
*  So that's one category. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=476.26s)]
*  However, Democrats have to also have simultaneously a forward looking vision. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=477.74s)]
*  I mean, the chaos. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=481.90000000000003s)]
*  An alternative. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=482.90000000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=483.90000000000003s)]
*  The chaos is is is riding itself. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=484.90000000000003s)]
*  We're seeing it every day. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=486.06s)]
*  People are worried and we have not even seen. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=487.06s)]
*  Let's remind ourselves we have not even seen the fruition of these tariffs enacted yet. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=488.46000000000004s)]
*  We're probably going to see that in the next two to three months as these prices really [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=493.02s)]
*  take hold here. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=495.94s)]
*  But you've got to create and talk about as Democrats a forward looking vision. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=497.14s)]
*  And I got to tell you, I mean, I don't know what the Democratic Party's economic [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=500.62s)]
*  vision is right now. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=505.3s)]
*  I think they will get there. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=506.3s)]
*  But we as Democrats, both on Capitol Hill, governors throughout the states have to do [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=507.86s)]
*  a better job of really talking about what our plan is for the economy. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=513.3s)]
*  And I think we as we get closer to the midterm elections, you will see that. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=518.62s)]
*  But it can't just be something we're running against Trump's economic policies. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=522.34s)]
*  We're running against Trump's divisiveness and chaos and raising prices. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=526.46s)]
*  We actually have to put forward our vision. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=530.26s)]
*  And I think that's something Democrats really need to focus on and work on over the next [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=532.6600000000001s)]
*  16 months. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=535.74s)]
*  Well, and there are so many interesting races to watch. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=536.74s)]
*  Just in Georgia, I think we have the tweet we can show where Marjorie Taylor Greene notified [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=539.5400000000001s)]
*  the public that she is declining to run for the Senate. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=545.22s)]
*  It's on the edge of my seat. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=547.9000000000001s)]
*  And Governor Brian Kemp, who's hugely popular, he is not running for the Senate also. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=549.38s)]
*  So what do you foresee in Georgia? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=554.9000000000001s)]
*  Is that good for John Ossoff and Democrats? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=557.34s)]
*  It's definitely good for John Ossoff and Democrats. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=559.6600000000001s)]
*  And we obviously must remember that Biden won Georgia in 2020. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=561.4599999999999s)]
*  We lost Georgia in 2024, but we certainly consider that state to be a swing state, a [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=565.62s)]
*  state that Democrats certainly have ripe opportunities for picking up the suburban communities, the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=570.6999999999999s)]
*  ex-Urb communities, suburban women, people who are going to be heavily impacted by these [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=577.26s)]
*  price hikes that Trump is enacting. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=582.42s)]
*  It's a real opportunity for Democrats. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=584.5s)]
*  And it certainly looks good for John Ossoff at this point in the campaign. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=586.1s)]
*  To zoom out a little bit, candidate quality, right? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=591.3000000000001s)]
*  The reason that Marjorie Taylor Greene jumped out, one of them is it feels like someone [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=594.3000000000001s)]
*  may have been whispering in her ear, like, ma'am, you're not going to help us here. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=598.5s)]
*  But we're seeing that happen in a couple of these other races, right? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=601.62s)]
*  Where Republicans are looking at who they have to run and are getting a little nervous. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=604.58s)]
*  At least that's who the ones that are talking to me are getting a little nervous because [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=609.94s)]
*  they've seen when you put someone who's a little too far right, someone who maybe isn't [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=612.86s)]
*  really from the area, Dr. Oz, then you lose there and you have an issue. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=617.62s)]
*  So talk a little bit about how Republicans should be thinking about candidate quality [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=621.38s)]
*  and actually doing something a little bit different than they have to. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=626.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=629.7s)]
*  I mean, you look at somebody like Governor Kemp, this guy is sort of cut from central [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=630.7s)]
*  casting. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=635.42s)]
*  This is somebody that the Republican Party knows plays well with the suburban swing [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=636.42s)]
*  voter that it takes to win in places like Georgia. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=641.62s)]
*  The fact that he is not stepping up and is saying, I don't, this is not the time to go [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=644.26s)]
*  right now, tells you just the kind of struggles that they're having internally. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=648.42s)]
*  Now, they're going to have a battle to fight, I think, still with their voters because this [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=652.66s)]
*  party is hook, line and sinker behind Trump, Trumpism and sort of the entertainment politics [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=657.9s)]
*  that he has built inside the Republican Party. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=664.78s)]
*  And that's going to take some time to unwind, I think. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=667.6999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, Adrian, another Democratic senator who isn't having a good time of it is Senator [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=670.46s)]
*  John Fetterman, Pennsylvania. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=678.02s)]
*  NBC News has this really concerning story. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=680.18s)]
*  In the past year, from April 2024 to this March, Fetterman missed 77 of 381 votes, according [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=685.3s)]
*  to GovTrack. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=691.78s)]
*  That put him in the 90th to 99th percentile among all senators in terms of total votes [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=692.86s)]
*  missed during each three month stretch of the calendar in that time. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=698.14s)]
*  I mean, this comes on the heels of a devastating profile of him in New York magazine by my [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=702.66s)]
*  former Washington Post colleague, Ben Terrace, that did not put the senator in a good light. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=709.1s)]
*  How, how concerned should Democrats be that, you know, Senator Fetterman, is he up for [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=713.86s)]
*  the job? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=720.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=721.22s)]
*  First of all, Jonathan, as you know, Democrats, our margins in the Senate are not great. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=722.22s)]
*  I mean, it certainly could have been far worse. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=727.4599999999999s)]
*  We nearly won a couple of races in some of the states that Harris lost, like Michigan, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=729.26s)]
*  Wisconsin, which is good. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=734.74s)]
*  So it got our margins up to 47. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=735.74s)]
*  But the bottom line is this is where self-sacrifice comes into play. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=737.78s)]
*  We cannot afford to lose another vote in the Senate. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=741.18s)]
*  And if that means that, you know, you have, you know, a challenging family situation that [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=744.8199999999999s)]
*  takes you away from voting, or if it means that you have, you know, an illness or whatever [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=750.42s)]
*  it is, this is where I think folks really need to take a step back, self-reflect and [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=755.02s)]
*  think how can I actually make sure that Democrats have the representation? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=759.86s)]
*  We need so much is on the line. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=764.1s)]
*  We're dealing with Trump, who is becoming more and more authoritarian by the day. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=765.98s)]
*  We cannot afford to lose, you know, the folks that we have in the Senate who actually do [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=770.0600000000001s)]
*  have some power. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=774.46s)]
*  But does it come at the expense of his ability to do the job? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=775.46s)]
*  Because looking at these stories all told and talking to the staffers who work with [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=779.3000000000001s)]
*  They have concerns that he can't even do the job, even if he's there just in case. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=783.38s)]
*  He's not voting a lot. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=787.6999999999999s)]
*  Look, I think when you are a former staffer who was around him very closely and saw a [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=789.38s)]
*  lot of things and saw a lot of things that frankly we're not seeing publicly and you [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=794.66s)]
*  chose to take some action, I think we have to really take those concerns seriously. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=800.02s)]
*  You know, I obviously love Senator Federman, as do many people, but we also have to take [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=805.22s)]
*  the concerns of people who have been around him more than we have very seriously. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=810.1s)]
*  And it's another chance for the Democrats, after all the criticisms they faced with President [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=813.86s)]
*  Biden, to really build some trust again with the American people and to be honest about [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=817.94s)]
*  what so many of us are seeing, I think. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=822.58s)]
*  And early on at the end of the day. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=824.82s)]
*  Adrian Elrod and Heath Mayo, thank you so much for being on the show. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvH_nJTvL2U&t=826.5s)]
