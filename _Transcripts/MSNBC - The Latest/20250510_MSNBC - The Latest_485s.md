Melanie Stansbury (D-NM), who was involved in some of these heated exchanges, blasts DOGE’s touted accomplishments and calls on her Republican colleagues in Washington to put a stop to cuts to the federal government.

# DOGE ‘flopped’: Rep. Stansbury slams Musk, GOP over ‘complete joke’ of lack of real savings
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I)
*  You took a minute of my time wasting my time on a non point of order the gentlelady's time [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=0.0s)]
*  is expired I now recognize Ms. McClain from Michigan. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=8.5s)]
*  Time was not wasted and to the trans community we stand with you with the LGBTQ plus community [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=12.88s)]
*  we stand with you and you can raise your ear drums all you want Madam Chair but we stand [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=19.92s)]
*  with the LGBTQ plus community and you can gavel me to order this hearing will come to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=26.2s)]
*  order. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=32.8s)]
*  All right this week a hearing on the House Subcommittee on delivering on government efficiency [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=33.8s)]
*  aka DOGE spiraled into chaos after the top Democrat on the committee called into question [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  the intention of the hearings topic transgender athletes participating in fencing competitions. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  The subcommittee chair congresswoman Marjorie Taylor-Green said the topic was indeed tied [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=51.76s)]
*  to government efficiency because President Trump signed an order barring transgendered [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=56.14s)]
*  women from competing in women's sports. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=60.36s)]
*  Joining us now is the ranking Democratic member on that subcommittee New Mexico congresswoman [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=62.96s)]
*  Melanie Stansberry. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Congresswoman that hearing seemed to get a little off topic why do we think DOGE you [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=68.8s)]
*  know something that's supposed to look into waste fraud and abuse from the government [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=74.96s)]
*  time looking into sports and what exactly prompted that heated exchange we just played. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=79.12s)]
*  Well it's very clear that the entire DOGE enterprise has completely flopped over the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=85.44s)]
*  last hundred plus days we've seen is not only Elon Musk has failed to deliver on any of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=90.56s)]
*  the promises he made the American people have spoken up that they reject the way in which [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  he's gone about it the mass firings the dismantling of agencies the data mining of our sensitive [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=101.06s)]
*  data and setting himself up for private contracts and now in his wake we've got two thirds of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=106.92s)]
*  Americans opposing him the president's approval ratings are in the dumps in part because [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=112.68s)]
*  of Elon Musk and DOGE the Republicans won't even say his name in public right now and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=117.76s)]
*  I think that's fascinating and a hearing and in a committee that was set up to do that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=122.92s)]
*  bidding and so what we saw this week was a complete distraction the Republicans are basically [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=128.24s)]
*  now using this committee to pivot to red meat issues that they think are going to give [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=134.4s)]
*  them some sort of you know political cadence with their political base that have literally [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=139.52s)]
*  nothing to do with government efficiency and I think that the Democrats showed up with [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=145.68s)]
*  the receipts we showed up ready to defend and stand with the LGBTQ plus community and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=151.4s)]
*  against trans hate and the chairwoman didn't like that and so she tried to gavel us down [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  all committee but we kept vigilant and we're doing the work of the American people I do [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=162.12s)]
*  want to drill down into some of those numbers of the receipts as you were just talking about [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=168.68s)]
*  so Elon Musk originally predicted two trillion dollars in cuts to the federal budget he then [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=172.38s)]
*  scaled that down to one trillion and then settled on somewhere around 150 billion in [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=177.34s)]
*  projected savings for the 2026 fiscal year that's about two percent of federal spending [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile there's this Wall Street Journal analysis that finds government spending since [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=188.0s)]
*  Trump's inauguration is a hundred and fifty four billion dollars more than during the same period [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=192.12s)]
*  in 2024 so how can doge justify its mission of eliminated government waste and saving taxpayer [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=197.2s)]
*  money do you think at this point it has been a complete failure oh absolutely I mean I think [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=205.4s)]
*  from the start it was a farce and while I think Democrats at large are very much dedicated to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=210.52s)]
*  making sure that the government is efficient and modernized and that we make changes to how we [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=216.96s)]
*  deliver services it's very clear that Elon Musk had you know a dream one day about creating this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=222.36s)]
*  effort to try to remake the federal government using a tech model and it within the ideological [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  bounds of his ideas about the world and the worldview and he gave Donald Trump you know almost [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  $300 million to fund his campaign and so sure Donald Trump gave him carte blanche to go in there [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=241.32s)]
*  and do it and it completely failed he was unable to do anything that even resembled creating [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=248.28s)]
*  efficiency and as you're pointing out and as these studies are pointing out Donald Trump actually [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=254.32s)]
*  increased spending over his first hundred days over the last administration while they were [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=259.2s)]
*  withholding funding for food aid for children who were starving around the world while they were [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=264.88s)]
*  cutting back services at Social Security while they were holding on to vital funding to help our [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=270.68s)]
*  communities do the basic services that our seniors and our children need so this has been a complete [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  joke and on his way out as Elon Musk is headed out and we don't know what's gonna happen to the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=284.52s)]
*  formal Doge Bros who are still there but I suspect many of them will leave since it's been such an [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=290.08s)]
*  abject failure you know he's leaving with having accessed and analyzed the most valuable data sets [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=295.92s)]
*  on planet earth and he set himself up for billions of dollars in new contracts but the American people [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=302.48s)]
*  don't want this this is not what they voted for even Republicans overwhelmingly reject what Doge [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=309.08000000000004s)]
*  is doing and it's very clear that the Republicans don't have a plan except for the nefarious plans [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=315.04s)]
*  that they're gonna try to put into place through Donald Trump's budget so Doge is now pivoting to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=320.96s)]
*  Donald Trump's budget which we saw delivered to Congress two weeks ago and we're seeing this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=326.76s)]
*  unprecedented effort to dismantle Medicaid food assistance and environmental programs to give [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  seven trillion dollars in tax breaks to billionaires permanently so that's the only agenda they have and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  it is so historically and absolutely a failure and rejected by the American people they're holding [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=347.24s)]
*  hearings attacking trans kids and trying to rename the Gulf of Mexico that's their agenda I mean the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=354.72s)]
*  issue is though if it is as you call it a joke the problem is it's had some very real consequences I [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=362.48s)]
*  mean we were just talking in the studio here about how many folks we all know here in DC who have [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=368.12s)]
*  been laid off who don't know their status who are sitting around trying to pay their bills what are [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  Democrats doing to fix that you know USAID drove by the other day it's still shuttered some of these [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=376.76s)]
*  agencies are still not functioning what are Democrats doing to solve this problem if it is as big of a [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  problem as you say it is oh absolutely so let me be clear I'm not calling the consequences a joke [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=386.84s)]
*  but I'm calling a joke is the idea that Elon Musk was going to somehow magically fix the government [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=393.68s)]
*  the consequences have been absolutely devastating for the United States for our federal workers for [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  programs for our international standing and right now we just saw a judge yesterday in a federal court [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=404.6s)]
*  in San Francisco rule that the executive order that Donald Trump signed that set much of this in [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=411.48s)]
*  motion has to be immediately halted so we are fighting back in Congress using our oversight [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=416.92s)]
*  capabilities we're fighting back in the courts there's now over 200 court cases with over 140 [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=422.8s)]
*  court injunctions against the Trump administration and we're fighting back in educating folks in our [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=429.08000000000004s)]
*  communities because at the end of the day none of this has to happen the Republicans are in the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=434.24s)]
*  majority all we need is four Republicans in the house to have a backbone and stand up for the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  Constitution and do their jobs and we could stop this now so it's really important that we continue [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=445.08s)]
*  to organize in our communities that people speak up and speak out and Democrats are gonna hold their [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=451.68s)]
*  feet to the fire and continue to do that work and to stop them at every step that we can all right [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=457.0s)]
*  thank you congresswoman Melanie Stansberry we're gonna have to leave it there [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOhzvN6s4I&t=462.36s)]
