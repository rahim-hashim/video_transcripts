# Dems gear up for midterms: ‘The last time they cut Medicaid, we booked the House’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE)
*  First came the big, beautiful bill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, as political reports, Senate Republicans are promising a big, beautiful rewrite. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=3.14s)]
*  According to The Hill, five to seven Republican senators have already expressed concerns about [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  the House bill because of major cuts to Medicaid. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  That was before they found out it also slashes Medicare. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=18.8s)]
*  At the same time, some Senate Republicans want to go even further, pushing for even [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=24.72s)]
*  deeper cuts than the House version, which, according to the Congressional Budget Office, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=29.46s)]
*  already kicks, get this number, 13.7 million Americans off health insurance. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=34.86s)]
*  And that reduces resources for the poorest Americans by 2 percent in 2027 and increases [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=42.660000000000004s)]
*  them for the richest Americans by 4 percent, all while raising our national debt by more [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=48.82s)]
*  than $3 trillion over 10 years. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=55.54s)]
*  Democrats warn that's not just bad policy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=60.379999999999995s)]
*  It's political malpractice. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=62.78s)]
*  And they had a lot to say about it on the House floor. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=64.96s)]
*  Every provision in this program is cruel, and they know it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=69.96s)]
*  That's why none of them spoke on it in committee. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=74.02s)]
*  When you wake up in the morning, you will realize that you voted to defund Planned Parenthood [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=76.4s)]
*  and to take away health care from 13.7 million Americans. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=82.38s)]
*  And when this country wakes up in the morning, there will be consequences to pay for this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=86.3s)]
*  When the votes are ultimately cast on that first Tuesday in November next year, that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=91.86s)]
*  this day may very well turn out to be the day that House Republicans lost control of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=101.14s)]
*  the United States House of Representatives. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=109.34s)]
*  And joining us now is Democratic Congresswoman Lauren Underwood of Illinois. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=114.18s)]
*  Congresswoman, welcome to the weekend. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=118.7s)]
*  So my mom is a former nurse, retired nurse. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=121.9s)]
*  You're a former nurse. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=126.18s)]
*  Talk about, spell out how this budget plan will affect Americans' health care access. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=127.54s)]
*  Well, we know that nearly 14 million Americans are about to be kicked off of their health [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=133.02s)]
*  care, which will be devastating for American kids, devastating because Medicaid, the Medicaid [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=138.45999999999998s)]
*  program covers half of kids in this country. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=143.78s)]
*  We also know that for those individuals who purchase their own health care through the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=146.45999999999998s)]
*  marketplaces, a.k.a. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=149.94s)]
*  Obamacare, they're going to have a real hard time affording their plans because the Republicans [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=151.94s)]
*  declined to extend the extremely popular tax credits that made their health care premiums [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  more affordable. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=162.14s)]
*  At the end of the day, I think we can expect all-cause mortality, meaning death rates to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=163.14s)]
*  go up across the country. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=168.28s)]
*  And that is nothing to celebrate. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=170.36s)]
*  One of the things, a few things that I'm obsessed with in this story is the speed at which this [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=172.2s)]
*  happened. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=178.76s)]
*  One, the Affordable Care Act by comparison, 427 days to pass the measure legislation. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=179.76s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act, 357 days. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=186.0s)]
*  An average budget reconciliation, 152. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=188.52s)]
*  This budget reconciliation so far, 88 days. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=191.6s)]
*  Now, there were a lot of things that they did during the, they do a public comment period. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=194.88000000000002s)]
*  They also did this in the dead of night. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=200.88000000000002s)]
*  They also set the work requirements to start after the midterms. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=202.38000000000002s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  So it seems they know that this is unpopular and still did it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=207.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, they don't care. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=210.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=211.12s)]
*  They don't care about the American people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=212.12s)]
*  They don't care about people having health care. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=213.12s)]
*  They don't care about hungry kids and families. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  They don't care about the destruction that we're seeing in communities across the country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  And Donald Trump has advanced in economic policy through these tariffs that have already [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=222.12s)]
*  made prices increase. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=225.82s)]
*  And now we're making, they are making health care less affordable. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=227.52s)]
*  They are making food and groceries out of reach for vulnerable families in this country. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=230.84s)]
*  And I think that it's just wrong. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=236.44s)]
*  It speaks to their values. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=237.74s)]
*  Yeah, because Trump says stay off of earned benefits, stay out of that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=239.04s)]
*  And yet here we are. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=242.04s)]
*  He literally came to the Hill and he was like, stay the F away from Medicaid. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=243.04s)]
*  And these guys were like, you can't make me, you can't make me. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  This is our bill. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=249.6s)]
*  They're gleefully celebrating cutting people off of health care. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=250.6s)]
*  Now let's listen to what some GOP senators have been saying about this bill because there's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=254.0s)]
*  going to be another fight between deficit hawks and those who don't want any cuts to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=258.36s)]
*  Medicaid. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=263.04s)]
*  So let's hear that now. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=264.04s)]
*  I couldn't care less if these are sad. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=265.04s)]
*  I'm concerned about my children, my grandchildren and the fact that we are stealing from them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=267.84s)]
*  We are stealing from our children and grandchildren, $37 trillion in debt and we're going to add [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  to it as Republicans. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=278.2s)]
*  That is unacceptable. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=281.2s)]
*  And that's why there's no way I'm going to vote for this bill in its current form. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=282.2s)]
*  The House bill is going to add about $4 trillion to the debt ceiling. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=286.56s)]
*  The Senate bill adds $5 trillion. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=290.0s)]
*  There's nothing fiscally conservative about expanding the debt ceiling more than we've [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=292.72s)]
*  ever done it before. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=298.12s)]
*  I mean, the Senate's going to want to put its own stamp on this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=299.12s)]
*  We'll write our own version of the bill. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=301.04s)]
*  I talked to the president about this last night and his instructions were pretty clear. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=302.2s)]
*  Don't cut Medicaid. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=305.48s)]
*  So how do you think this bill is going to fare in the Senate? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=308.6s)]
*  I think that each of these senators is going to get a little sweetener. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=312.36s)]
*  We saw it happen overnight in the House where one Republican member got a tax removed on [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=315.04s)]
*  the silencers. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  And now we're going to see more and more deadly shootings in this country. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=323.0s)]
*  They're deregulating, you know, these accessories on deadly weapons as a sweetener to get the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=327.72s)]
*  Republicans to vote for the tax bill. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=332.24s)]
*  I think that we're going to expect to see more of that in the Senate. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=334.4s)]
*  Congresswoman, I'm sorry, go ahead, Elise. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=337.84s)]
*  I was just going to say, well, Democrats, do you think this is a potent issue for political [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=341.47999999999996s)]
*  attack coming into the midterms? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=346.67999999999995s)]
*  Politico was reporting that there's a big digital buy that Democrats are going to roll [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=349.4s)]
*  out ads attacking Republicans on Medicaid. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=354.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's already started. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=357.2s)]
*  The American people understand what it means to cut their health care. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=359.23999999999995s)]
*  Listen, this is not that complicated. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=362.4s)]
*  It's not so nuanced that regular Americans don't get it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=364.0s)]
*  And the last time these guys came for our health care, we flipped the house. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=366.92s)]
*  We picked up 43 seats. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=370.2s)]
*  I was part of that class in 2018. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=371.72s)]
*  And so, you know, right now I'm working with the D-TRIP as the recruitment co-chair. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=374.06s)]
*  We are talking to candidates across the battleground. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=378.64s)]
*  They are fired up and they're ready to win. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=380.96s)]
*  Eugene, have you asked the question yet? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=384.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=387.68s)]
*  It is early here in Chicago. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=388.68s)]
*  So I didn't want to take a question away from you, Eugene. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=394.52s)]
*  But Congresswoman, I want to pick up on something that you just mentioned, that the sweeteners [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=397.48s)]
*  that the Republicans are getting to get them to vote. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=403.56s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=406.88s)]
*  There aren't supposed to be non-budget related issues in reconciliation bills, right? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=409.68s)]
*  Since when did they start following the rules? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=415.5s)]
*  Since when did Donald Trump follow the law? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=417.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you have to remember who we're talking about here. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=419.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=422.84000000000003s)]
*  So I'm glad you... [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  So then, fine, sweeteners and all. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  And we just saw it showed that sotmash of all those Senate Republicans talking smack [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=426.92s)]
*  about the House bill that's about to come over to them. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  But I'm just wondering, do you have any faith that all that smack talk is going to continue [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=435.92s)]
*  once President Trump troops up to the Hill, goes to the Senate side and says, y'all, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=441.32000000000005s)]

*  I would not trust my health care in the hands of Ron Johnson. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=450.64000000000004s)]
*  I would not trust my health care in the hands of Tom Tillis. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=454.12s)]
*  I would not trust my health care in the hands of these guys. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=457.24s)]
*  I just don't... [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't think that they have a lot of credibility when it comes to protecting the social safety [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  net for working families in this country. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=465.26s)]
*  One of the things that's really interesting about them kind of keeping the tax cuts, right? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=467.64000000000004s)]
*  But that doesn't give people who are poor more tax cut, like another tax cut. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=473.56s)]
*  They're not getting anything out of this. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=478.84s)]
*  They're just keeping what happened in 2017. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=480.12s)]
*  So I guess I'm interested in if the American people are saying, we want more tax cuts, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=482.0s)]
*  we need more money, we're broke, we can't afford eggs, and they're not doing that, political [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=488.34000000000003s)]
*  ramifications for that as well. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=493.64s)]
*  Well, right, because instead they're cutting health care for Americans. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=495.2s)]
*  little child tax credit that they're championing doesn't do nearly as much as what we did in [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=499.6s)]
*  the American Rescue Plan. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  There are so few children that are going to benefit from this marginal increase from $2,000 [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=506.28000000000003s)]
*  to $2,500, and I don't even think it's refundable. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=512.36s)]
*  I just think that they're not credible on this issue. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=514.88s)]
*  This is not a tax plan that in any way rewards working families in this country. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=517.76s)]
*  All the benefits, all the benefits go to the billionaires. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=522.12s)]
*  Instead, working families, people who have to go to work every day to put food on the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=525.68s)]
*  table are going to be left holding the bag. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=529.8s)]
*  And Congresswoman, the debt, it makes all of our economic situations worse because of [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=532.28s)]
*  inflation, interest rates, so many of the rippling cascade effects. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=538.28s)]
*  Can Democrats use the deficit whole as a potent political weapon in midterms too? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=542.5999999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=548.8399999999999s)]
*  I think it's all on the table for us. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=549.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's nothing, there's no upside here. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=551.3599999999999s)]
*  There's nothing positive. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=553.88s)]
*  What they are doing is taking a big risk on America's future for future generations to [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=554.9599999999999s)]
*  have to pay off, and it's rewarding these billionaires who have never been paying their [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=559.52s)]
*  fair share to begin with. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=564.1999999999999s)]
*  I think that it's a really bad deal. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=565.56s)]
*  Donald Trump talks about dealmaking literally every day, and he doesn't seem to recognize [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=567.88s)]
*  how the American people lose. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=572.1999999999999s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=574.4799999999999s)]
*  This is not going to be a pretty negotiation when it happens. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=575.76s)]
*  I'm very curious to see how those two camps within the Senate reconcile the deficit alts [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=581.64s)]
*  and the ones who know that this is a political loser when they're up for re-elections. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=587.76s)]
*  They all know it's a political loser, right? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=592.76s)]
*  You can hear them talking about it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=594.64s)]
*  But at the end of the day, senators, they don't have every two years, they don't have [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  to do it every two years, so they have more leeway to ignore President Trump. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=600.84s)]
*  So we'll see if that actually happens. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=604.48s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=605.72s)]
*  Well, Congresswoman. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=606.72s)]
*  Congresswoman said, no. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=607.72s)]
*  She was like, guys, come on. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=608.72s)]
*  I heard that. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=609.72s)]
*  But can I just say, people are upset. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=610.84s)]
*  Call your senator. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=612.84s)]
*  Call him now. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=613.84s)]
*  Call him on Tuesday when everybody gets back from the holiday weekend, right? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=614.84s)]
*  The American people have so much power in this moment. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=618.9200000000001s)]
*  Our voices matter in this debate. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=621.0s)]
*  Make your voice heard. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHmFe26JcPE&t=623.8000000000001s)]
