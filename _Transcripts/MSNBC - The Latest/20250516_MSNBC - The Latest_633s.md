# 'Scaring people from speaking out' against Trump: Rieckhoff on Comey being investigated for post
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0)
*  Let's see what happens to her. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=0.0s)]
*  That was Donald Trump back in 2016 calling for secret service agents guarding Hillary Clinton to drop their guns. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=2.0s)]
*  A comment that was slammed as inflammatory and dangerous, but not investigated. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=9.6s)]
*  There was also a social media post from 2024, which we won't show you, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=14.08s)]
*  where Donald Trump amplified an image of President Biden hog-tied in the back of a pickup truck. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Again, the post was slammed as inflammatory and dangerous, but Donald Trump wasn't investigated. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=24.16s)]
*  So if Donald Trump cleared those bars, what makes this post from former FBI director James Comey so much worse? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=30.0s)]
*  So bad, in fact, that the Secret Service is investigating James Comey for making a threat on Donald Trump's life. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=38.4s)]
*  What do these seashells arranged in a numerical sequence mean? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=45.36s)]
*  DNI Tulsi Gabbard says it's clear that James Comey was issuing a hit on Donald Trump. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=50.72s)]
*  Congressman Tim Burchett says Comey should be arrested. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=57.76s)]
*  Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita says he'd raid Comey's effing house. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=61.44s)]
*  And Trump himself says it means Comey wants him assassinated. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=67.28s)]
*  Quote, a child knows what that meant. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=72.16s)]
*  Does Matt Gaetz? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=75.12s)]
*  Because here's a tweet from Matt Gaetz saying he'd 86th Republican leadership. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=76.56s)]
*  Did Matt Gaetz assassinate Kevin McCarthy, Ronald McDaniel, or Mitch McConnell? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=81.76s)]
*  Did he try? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=85.76s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=86.8s)]
*  He was bragging about getting them ousted from Republican leadership. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=88.24s)]
*  So why is 86ing someone suddenly a death threat? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=92.96s)]
*  How is it worse than saying maybe the Second Amendment people can stop Hillary Clinton, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  something Donald Trump did as well? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=102.24s)]
*  Or again, promoting an image of a sitting president hogtied in the back of a pickup truck. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=103.92s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=110.16s)]
*  host of Independent Americans podcast Paul Rykhoff. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=113.36s)]
*  Washington Post national reporter and MSNBC contributor Carol Lenig. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=116.64s)]
*  And former senior special agent with the Secret Service and former special assistant [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=121.52s)]
*  U.S. prosecutor Christopher McClennock. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  Carol, give us a little bit of the background here. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=129.2s)]
*  What's the beef, remind us, with James Comey? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=131.76s)]
*  I liked your wind up there, Katie, because it speaks to my heart in the Secret Service, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=137.68s)]
*  which is how they decide when there's an actual threat against the president and his life. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=144.88s)]
*  The Secret Service did not think there was a threat against the president's life when [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump suggested and had a picture of Joe Biden tied, hogtied to the back of a pickup truck, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=155.76s)]
*  which many people thought was promoting violence in its imagery. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=163.2s)]
*  The beef with former FBI director Comey runs deep. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump in 2017 called on Comey privately in various meetings to exonerate him, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=172.32s)]
*  to exculpate him, to say that the Russian probe had nothing to do with Donald Trump and did not [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=179.2s)]
*  implicate him in any way or his campaign. And Comey essentially brushed it off because he [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=185.68s)]
*  was an independent director of the FBI and he knew that the investigation into Russian [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=191.68s)]
*  contacts with Trump's 2016 presidential campaign was legitimate and appropriate. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=196.88s)]
*  He was essentially fired for not complying with then President Trump's request that Comey show [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=202.64s)]
*  fealty. And ever since, Donald Trump has promised to pay Comey back, essentially. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  If I were in former director Comey's shoes, I maybe wouldn't post things on social media [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=215.76s)]
*  because you have Donald Trump basically pledging that he's going to find a way to get this guy in [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=223.6s)]
*  trouble, to come after him criminally, civilly, come after him some way. And he's made that very [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=230.24s)]
*  clear. He's not shying away from that boast. And here, these seashells don't seem very violent to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=236.16s)]
*  me, but they do suggest get rid of Donald Trump politically at the minimum. And that imagery is [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  something that the Secret Service at Donald Trump's behest can now seize upon. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=251.2s)]
*  Chris, let me ask you as a former senior special agent with the Secret Service, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=257.68s)]
*  what is your read on this? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=262.88s)]
*  Well, I think she was pretty accurate when she said that at the behest of the president, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=267.84s)]
*  the Secret Service is going to look into this, unfortunately. As an agency, we try to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  go above the political fray that said, if a sitting president is advising that you need [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=278.08s)]
*  to take a look at something, you inevitably will. Again, the fact that it's a message in seashells, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  using the vernacular of probably a 1920s gangster as an 86-some-one, all that be damned. The fact [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=297.12s)]
*  is it was made by the former director of the FBI. And candidly, it maybe should have been a little [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=306.72s)]
*  more responsible. It could be argued that, in fact, he knew or should have known the controversies [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=316.0s)]
*  that such a message would bring about. That said, is it going to actually constitute a threat? I [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=322.72s)]
*  doubt it. Is it going to lead to criminal charges? Does this actually warrant getting up to the level [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=329.84s)]
*  of probable cause where you can go in front of a grand jury and get an indicted? I seriously doubt [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=337.76s)]
*  that. And would it ever, in any universe, get to the point of actually a criminal conviction [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=343.28s)]
*  beyond a reasonable doubt? I seriously, seriously doubt that as well. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=349.84s)]
*  I don't like doing the what-about-ism, but this screams for it. And so I'm going to touch on it, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  as I did a moment ago. And Chris, I want to ask you about the image that, again, we're not showing, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=361.52s)]
*  that President Trump reposted of President Biden hogtied in the back of a pickup truck. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  It was a guy driving a pickup truck on Long Island, a bunch of Trump flags on top of his car. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  And in the back of it, there was a decal image that mimicked the back of the pickup truck [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=378.32s)]
*  on the back of the pickup truck. And it showed President Biden on his side hogtied. And it looked [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=384.24s)]
*  like that's what was in the guy's car. And the president, who's now the president, who's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=390.56s)]
*  campaigning back then, retweeted that while President Biden was the president. Can you [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=395.35999999999996s)]
*  help me compare the posting of those two images? Are they the same? Are the seashells worse? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=400.72s)]
*  Why was one investigated and the other not? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=408.32000000000005s)]
*  I think we hit on that. And that is it was at the behest of a president in one regard and not at the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  behest of another president. It's unfortunate that potentially criminal investigations can [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=419.44000000000005s)]
*  be led in that direction. But in this case, I believe they were. I believe that seashells [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=427.52s)]
*  have risen to the level of a potential threat, whereas that previous post that you mentioned [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=434.0s)]
*  did not because of that. We live in a time where there was recently, maybe about eight years ago, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=443.84s)]
*  a comedian who held up the Fox head of the now sitting president, a bloody head of his. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=450.08s)]
*  And that did not lead to a criminal indictment. That did not lead to criminal charges. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=459.76s)]
*  Again, I think a lot of the time, unfortunately, it's at the behest of who is in fact in the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  position of authority at that time. You know, our NBC News reporters, Sarah Fitzpatrick and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=474.64s)]
*  Kelly O'Donnell did some good reporting on this, and they have a former federal prosecutor [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=480.56s)]
*  who's investigated threat cases saying he didn't commit a crime. He gave his enemies an opening. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  I think that's a very accurate way of putting it. And Sarah and her reporting is referring to the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=492.47999999999996s)]
*  particular statute under which threats are typically prosecuted. And that statute has as [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=497.44s)]
*  its standard a knowing and willful communication of a threat, either through the mail or something [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=502.8s)]
*  else like a social media post. As Chris was just sharing with you, when Kathy Griffin posted that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=508.64s)]
*  picture of herself on Instagram many years ago, holding what was a fake bloodied head of then [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=515.52s)]
*  President Trump, she was in fact investigated. She was put on a no fly list. That investigation [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=522.32s)]
*  went on for a few months, and yet she was never charged. I think that in many respects is maybe a [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=527.92s)]
*  more appropriate comparator than the hog tying that you mentioned, because if that didn't rise [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=533.5999999999999s)]
*  to the level of being prosecutable, certainly this does not. People can mean 86 in a variety of ways. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=539.28s)]
*  Was this blisteringly dumb? Absolutely. Was it criminal? Likely not. 86 are french fries. We don't [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=545.76s)]
*  have any more french fries in the restaurant. Don't sell them. I mean, that's the way that I [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  think a lot of people see the term 86. It does feel, I mean, make the comparisons and whether [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=556.88s)]
*  they are commiserate, but it also does feel stupid on the part of James Comey. Absolutely. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=563.68s)]
*  And it's created an opening for his enemies. I think that's right. And the MAGA propaganda and [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=570.48s)]
*  spin machine is in full effect here. And it's actually having a larger political impact, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=574.4s)]
*  which is it is intimidating and scaring people from speaking out against Donald Trump. I mean, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=578.8s)]
*  the Secret Service is going to be really busy if this is the standard now, because one third of [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=583.44s)]
*  Facebook- But is it only going to be the standard for political problems of Donald Trump? He sees [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=588.0s)]
*  James Comey as a political enemy. I mean, it's not going to be, I doubt it's going to be Joe [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=592.32s)]
*  Schmo on Facebook, but if it was Joe Schmo, who happened to be a former member of the administration [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  who said 2020 was a fair election- If it's Joe Schmo on Facebook, it could be one third of people [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=600.8800000000001s)]
*  on Facebook. It could be one third of people on Twitter and X. And I think that is the intent [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=606.0s)]
*  here, not just to go after his political enemies, but to provide a chilling effect on opposition [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=610.08s)]
*  across the country. And it's having that effect. I'm sure there are lots of people who are scanning [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=615.5200000000001s)]
*  their Facebook right now wondering if they used 86 at any point in the last 20 years, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=618.88s)]
*  and they're pulling it down. And that is the larger impact that they're having with this agenda, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=623.2800000000001s)]
*  is stifling dissent, pushing down opposition and intimidating people. And in that regard, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=627.44s)]
*  I think it's working. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5fMgfTOM0&t=631.9200000000001s)]
