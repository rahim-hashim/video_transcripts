# War powers? Ari Melber on Trump’s deportation power grab and Supreme Court pushing back
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw)
*  A special report right now on the core rights and liberty protections the Trump administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=0.0s)]
*  has been both attacking and very brazenly testing in the highest courts in the land. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=5.04s)]
*  The push begins with Trump's mass deportation agenda, the people being hauled on and off [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=10.84s)]
*  planes and sent to various parts and corners of the world, but it doesn't necessarily stop [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=16.78s)]
*  there. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=22.32s)]
*  This has actually drawn a string of losses in federal courts, rebukes from multiple judges, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=23.32s)]
*  orders to bring back, sometimes wrongly, deported individuals. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=27.72s)]
*  There's been the Supreme Court losses in the early rounds. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=31.68s)]
*  You're probably familiar with some of that, but as Donald Trump keeps pushing, we now [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=34.12s)]
*  have this standoff between him and the courts, as the Wall Street Journal reports, and this [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  is the current baseline. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=43.84s)]
*  And these clashes already go beyond even the tense standoffs over foreign detainee rules [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  during the war on terror. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  We're past where we were then under Trump in the second term. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  And the president's challenge is to the law and the Constitution in a way that could go [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  even farther than those clashes. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=62.94s)]
*  Indeed, Trump's number two official in the White House, Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=65.84s)]
*  Miller, has asserted he says the administration is mulling ways to suspend the core longstanding [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=69.58s)]
*  liberty right against unlawful or unlimited government detention powers that they claim [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=76.92s)]
*  they're already looking at how to suspend habeas corpus. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=82.26s)]
*  The Constitution is clear, and that of course is the supreme law of the land, that the privilege [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=87.38000000000001s)]
*  of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  So I would say that's an option we're actively looking at. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=97.30000000000001s)]
*  Look, a lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=99.26s)]
*  That's their stance. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=104.62s)]
*  They're, quote, actively looking at it, and then he adds a kind of a bluster toward the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=105.62s)]
*  courts. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=110.5s)]
*  You don't do the, quote, right thing, which means agree with Trump on just about everything. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=111.5s)]
*  Maybe they'll suspend this right. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=115.62s)]
*  Now in our special report right now, I want to be very clear about this baseline. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=117.78s)]
*  In any era in American history, claims to suspend that core right of the Constitution [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=122.14s)]
*  are a huge deal. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=128.18s)]
*  That Latin phrase habeas corpus is one of the most important and vital rights that people [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=129.58s)]
*  have in their dealings with the government. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=135.14s)]
*  The founders were clear that that right would operate in the Constitution so no politician [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=138.66s)]
*  and no Congress can repeal it, and it would operate permanently to limit government powers [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=144.85999999999999s)]
*  against the people. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=152.1s)]
*  That is the baseline. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=153.7s)]
*  And while, yes, there are times where you might have an actual emergency or a world [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=155.1s)]
*  war, that would also be enumerated. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=159.5s)]
*  You can't just suspend the right because you don't like dissent or you have a different [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=162.14s)]
*  immigration policy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=168.28s)]
*  It could only be done suspended in the case of wartime invasion or emergency public safety. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=169.28s)]
*  That's what it says in the Constitution. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=175.76s)]
*  It means something good. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=177.04s)]
*  It means most presidents have never even gone near suspending it or even talking about how [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=179.76s)]
*  they could. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=184.84s)]
*  That's even after obviously shared public safety disasters and emergencies like the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  9-11 attacks. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=191.84s)]
*  And while Mr. Miller could be exaggerating, political aides have been known to do that, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=194.14s)]
*  on the deportation front, let's draw a direct line to his threat and what the administration [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=200.0s)]
*  has already done. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=205.17999999999998s)]
*  Rush to formally claim war powers in those first hundred days, a period where Americans [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  do know, whether you follow all this stuff closely or not, that there was no declared [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=212.5s)]
*  war or new war. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=216.42s)]
*  But that's part of the asserted war powers that the new president in his second term [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=217.94s)]
*  tried to assert by citing the old wartime Alien Enemies Act, which judges then rejected [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=224.74s)]
*  because there's no war on the southern border and the White House, as one judge put it, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=231.38s)]
*  failed to prove any invasion. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=236.42s)]
*  Now the history here is instructive. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=239.7s)]
*  America's had its share of wars and obviously related to that, intense debates about both [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=242.38s)]
*  wars themselves, whether to start them, where to wage them, and then the attendant powers [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=248.26s)]
*  that come alongside big wars. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=253.38s)]
*  Protests over those war powers or government overreach. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=256.18s)]
*  Consider the huge power of drafting people into battle, which is part of what animated [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=260.34s)]
*  the wider opposition to Vietnam. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=266.7s)]
*  Debates over how the U.S. treats people abroad during war, whether it follows human rights. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=272.62s)]
*  And I want to turn with you to history's lessons tonight because this is a very important thing [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=278.26s)]
*  we're going to be living through. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=282.26s)]
*  Some of them have possibly bad news for Trump's claims through his DOJ lawyers. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=283.86s)]
*  What the current clashes are telling is the administration is not exactly shy about its [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=290.42s)]
*  claims that it can suspend rights, something they say they may do further, or that they [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=296.98s)]
*  have war powers. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=301.74s)]
*  In fact, we just pressed top administration border czar Tom Homan about this. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  Another judge said the White House failed to prove the existence of the invasion or [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=310.26s)]
*  conflict required to justify invoking that act. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=313.70000000000005s)]
*  You've been blocked from using those wartime powers. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=317.26s)]
*  You don't have to be a war for alien enemies. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=319.3s)]
*  They're also going to be a predatory incursion. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=321.42s)]
*  That's what we believe happened. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=323.38s)]
*  Mr. Homan, I'll tell you so you have the benefit of knowing this is a Texas appointed judge. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=324.38s)]
*  I have the quote on the screen. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=328.58s)]
*  This term invaded concerns warfare. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=331.22s)]
*  So not people crossing what you're calling predatory. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=333.82s)]
*  But anyway, my key point to you is now the Supreme Court limited that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=337.1s)]
*  You're going to follow that unless and until the courts change it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=340.94s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=344.1s)]
*  Of course, we won't follow the Supreme Court. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=346.9s)]
*  Now this is playing out at the Supreme Court. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=349.82s)]
*  And it has allowed certain types of deportations while requiring actual real due process. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  And remember, the founders were concerned as we're going to see that wherever you set [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=360.29999999999995s)]
*  the minimum line, it's going to have implications because wherever the minimum is, is what some [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=365.34s)]
*  people will go through if the government accuses you, for example, of being here unlawfully. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=370.97999999999996s)]
*  Now Justice Sotomayor has warned about some of these problems, saying citizens under [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=376.26s)]
*  the Trump claims could be taken off the streets, forced onto planes. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=380.98s)]
*  And again, I'm going to leave this up for a moment because she says U.S. citizens. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=384.74s)]
*  She's talking to the public and the Trump administration. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=390.86s)]
*  And for those who say, oh, well, this is only for unlawful migrants or new people who came [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=394.78s)]
*  here. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=399.94s)]
*  She knows how things work. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=401.09999999999997s)]
*  She understands the law and then says this. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=402.53999999999996s)]
*  She's no stranger to such lawless regimes that this nation system of laws is designed [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=405.66s)]
*  to prevent, not enable their rise. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=409.98s)]
*  Sotomayor discussing the centuries that have led up to these protections that guarantee [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=413.58000000000004s)]
*  these rights for citizens. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=418.82000000000005s)]
*  In fact, you can trace it back all the way from before this country was founded in the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=419.82000000000005s)]
*  rebellion we've all learned about, the revolution we all study against kings and their kingly [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=425.98s)]
*  abuses of power. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=431.22s)]
*  You can go all the way back to about 13th century England and the Magna Carta, which [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=432.22s)]
*  was the initial attempt to try to have some sort of peace between what was then an unpopular [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=436.78000000000003s)]
*  king because a lot of times when you ask the people, they don't like these kings and some [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=442.66s)]
*  rebels. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=446.54s)]
*  And there was the idea that it would be a bartered way to have at least a basic protection [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=447.66s)]
*  from illegal imprisonment. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=452.14000000000004s)]
*  That is a ways back. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=455.06s)]
*  The world operated completely differently. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=456.58000000000004s)]
*  The notion of who was even a full human and what rights were and whether kings were ruling [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=459.38s)]
*  from godlike decrees was a different time. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=464.54s)]
*  But even then, this is my point to you tonight, as we think about whether folks want to take [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=467.78s)]
*  us backwards in history, the basic line of human rights was the idea that they would [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=471.42s)]
*  start checking the king's power, which began with detaining people and then maybe exiling [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=477.38s)]
*  or murdering them. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=484.76s)]
*  And that there had to be some due process. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=486.06s)]
*  That's how it worked. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=516.06s)]
*  I'd throw you into prison, cut off your head. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=521.06s)]
*  That's how kings ruled. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=524.02s)]
*  They didn't have much popular support, which is why so many of them had to kill so much. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=525.38s)]
*  And the Magna Carta was drawing on what you've heard referenced lately, what Mr. Miller seems [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=529.42s)]
*  to be intent upon right now. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=536.06s)]
*  The core protection against the government just detaining you forever for no reason, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=538.54s)]
*  habeas corpus. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=542.78s)]
*  In Latin, it means you have the body to produce the body that there has to be due process [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=544.1s)]
*  and you can't just take the body and throw it into a prison without any court process. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=547.9599999999999s)]
*  Now this was then made official in England later under the habeas corpus act. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=552.74s)]
*  That was in the late 1600s. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=557.36s)]
*  It was passed by a parliament to protect these sort of rights and to establish that you could [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=558.36s)]
*  petition your imprisonment and laying out how to do so. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=563.72s)]
*  Now you take this together and you say, all right, a lot of history. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=568.3399999999999s)]
*  Why do we have to go back so far? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=572.06s)]
*  But one of the key points that brings us up to today is how that baseline of history actually [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=574.14s)]
*  was the core protection. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=579.8s)]
*  Now the political attacks, some of it could be rhetoric, could be that Trump has aides [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=583.4599999999999s)]
*  who say this stuff and don't ever actually try to act on it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=588.0999999999999s)]
*  And Trump officials, at least under questioning, have conceded that judicial rulings are the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=592.3599999999999s)]
*  law and they will follow them. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=595.9s)]
*  And that normally wouldn't be very notable, but we are dealing with these detention debates [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=598.74s)]
*  now over what rights will attach. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=604.14s)]
*  And this is the founding principle which separates rule by the people, which we now call democracy, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=607.38s)]
*  from the oppression by the kings you just saw. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=614.1800000000001s)]
*  So the founders viewed these rights against just wanton detention as sacrosanct. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=616.9s)]
*  They viewed them along with the rights to vote or to speak and that you have to have [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=623.26s)]
*  these all together if you're going to have people exercising meaningful democracy to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=627.98s)]
*  hold rulers accountable. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=633.1800000000001s)]
*  Either you have them or you don't. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=634.5s)]
*  And so here we are in 2025 talking about a very powerful official and Mr. Miller saying, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=636.5s)]
*  maybe you don't have them, maybe they will suspend them. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=642.22s)]
*  And remember, kings could at that time, before we got these rights, they could just crush [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=644.62s)]
*  anything they didn't like by detaining, deporting or crushing dissent. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=651.72s)]
*  So you could try to have peaceful dissent, but if you were just going to be jailed for [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=657.3399999999999s)]
*  it, well, you don't have much of a democracy. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=660.9399999999999s)]
*  The exception, as I mentioned, was for, in the United States context, the actual example [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=663.42s)]
*  of an invading army or a rebellion. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=668.3399999999999s)]
*  The founders refer to that as rebellion or invasion. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=670.78s)]
*  And America's constitution proved to be a model for other nations here. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=674.66s)]
*  The Bill of Rights chiefly focuses on forwarding that very temptation that even if we make [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=678.14s)]
*  some progress, a president could still revert to trying to rule like a king. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=684.3s)]
*  You don't see the world's Donald Trump in these protections, but they're in the news [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=689.3399999999999s)]
*  tonight because that's exactly why you had these protections. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=692.78s)]
*  A politician could win power in an election, but then use it to oppress and end meaningful [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=697.0999999999999s)]
*  democracy. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG-unvoyzFw&t=701.74s)]
