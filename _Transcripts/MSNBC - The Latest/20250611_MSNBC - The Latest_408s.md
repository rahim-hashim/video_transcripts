# 'Authoritarian power grab': House member reacts to Trump's use of military 'as a police force'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E)
*  Welcome back. President Trump says anyone who protests at the military parade in Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=0.0s)]
*  on Saturday will be met with very heavy force. He said that speaking to reporters in the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=7.32s)]
*  Oval Office yesterday issuing this warning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  We're going to be celebrating big on Saturday. We're going to have a lot of and if there's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=16.48s)]
*  any protest at once, they come out, they will be met with very big force. By the way, for [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=19.8s)]
*  those people that want to protest, they're going to be met with very big force. And I [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=24.2s)]
*  haven't even heard about a protest, but you know, this is people that hate our country, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=27.96s)]
*  but they will be met with very heavy force. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=34.04s)]
*  So it's a feature, not a bug. Saturday's parade estimated to cost around 45 million dollars, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=37.56s)]
*  marking both the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army, but also Trump's 79th birthday. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=42.4s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts. Congressman, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=48.96s)]
*  there's a lot of parallels that you're seeing between your experience having been in the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=52.6s)]
*  Marines serving at 29 Palms training there. That's exactly what Marines on the ground [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=57.42s)]
*  in California are doing right now. I mean, what's your sense of the situation that we're [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=62.1s)]
*  watching in L.A.? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=65.94s)]
*  It's an authoritarian power grab. This president is manufacturing a crisis, claiming that Los [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=67.3s)]
*  Angeles is in, quote, rebellion, which is absurd in order to test the bounds of his [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=72.86s)]
*  power over the military and more precisely to use the military as a police force. And [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  right now I'm thinking, Ali, not just of Los Angeles and the fact that it could be Chicago [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=85.22s)]
*  or Boston next. I'm also thinking about these Marine officers in 29 Palms. I trained there [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=90.66s)]
*  for two years. I was in command of an infantry platoon. Those boys are trained to be lethal. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=96.94s)]
*  29 Palms is the elite training ground for the United States military. They are training [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  to destroy the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in Syria or to fight off the People's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=105.62s)]
*  Liberation Army in Guam. They are not trained to do de-escalation with fellow citizens in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=111.02s)]
*  Los Angeles, nor is it necessary. The California state and local authorities are well equipped [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=115.86s)]
*  to uphold public order. If I were a Marine officer there, some First Lieutenant, I'd [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=120.42s)]
*  be looking at this executive order and saying, I don't think it's lawful, but a judge hasn't [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=126.02s)]
*  ruled on it yet. And I'm put in this impossible situation of either disobeying what I have [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=131.34s)]
*  to at least presume is a lawful order until a judge rules otherwise or going against my instincts [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=136.66s)]
*  on the Constitution. And that is such an unfair situation to put these young men and women in. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=141.62s)]
*  And it's why Congress needs to act to reform these 19th century laws that give the president way too [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  much latitude over Posse Comitatus. Yeah. And that Latin phrase, I think, is one that we might hear [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=151.06s)]
*  a little bit more frequently. But for viewers who don't speak Latin, why is it relevant here? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=156.42s)]
*  There's basically two laws that are governing the situation. The first is Posse Comitatus. The law [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=161.3s)]
*  is from the 19th century, but the principle goes all the way back to the Magna Carta. And it basically [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=164.98s)]
*  says the president generally can't use the military as a police force. And that's a really good idea. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=168.5s)]
*  We have a thousand years of history that say, yeah, you don't want your executives to use the military [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=172.98s)]
*  as a police force. But there's exceptions to that law. And the Insurrection Act are basically the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=177.22s)]
*  list of exceptions. And they are way too broad. And they are very poorly drafted. And Congress needs [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=181.7s)]
*  to get in there and say, there's basically only two scenarios that you're allowed to use the military [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=186.1s)]
*  as a police force. Number one should be an insurrection, like the Civil War. It's worth noting, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=189.7s)]
*  by the way, that when we actually had an insurrection on January 6th, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=194.58s)]
*  President Trump refused to call in the National Guard. I think that parallel is well underscored [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=197.62s)]
*  here. Yeah. Not trying to defend cops on Capitol Hill, but he is trying to beat up citizens in Los [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  Angeles, right? Number two is if a class of citizens are being systemically deprived of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=208.26000000000002s)]
*  their constitutional rights. So think about the civil rights era in the 1960s. The president [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=213.46s)]
*  federalized the National Guard to desegregate the schools. Yeah. Those are two exceptional scenarios. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=217.38000000000002s)]
*  This does not qualify. It also comes against the backdrop of a parade that we were talking about [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=222.98s)]
*  at the very start of the segment that's going to be happening here in Washington, D.C. That happens [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=228.1s)]
*  to coincide with the president's birthday, but is actually for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=231.94s)]
*  It feels, and we started the show talking about this, like this week is meant to project the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=237.7s)]
*  optics of Trump as someone who has the military at his fingertips, because he is, of course, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  commander in chief. It's an expensive birthday party for an overgrown toddler, and it's an irony [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=247.38s)]
*  that I'm sure is lost on him, but the United States Army was born out of the Continental Army under [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=253.46s)]
*  George Washington, and one of the reasons that George Washington is such an important founding [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=257.94s)]
*  father for us is that he actually refused to use the military for political ends. His officers came [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=262.42s)]
*  to him in 1783 and said, we want you to usurp the Confederation of Congress. We're sick of them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=268.02s)]
*  People hated Congress then, too. And he said no. Some things don't change. In the Newberg Address, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=272.5s)]
*  he said, I won't do it. I respect civilian authority over the military. One of the great [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=277.3s)]
*  moments in the history of Western democracy, and this president, who of course doesn't understand [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=282.5s)]
*  that history, is trampling upon that tradition. We've also seen some Republicans, including the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=286.34s)]
*  perennial vulnerable California Republican David Valadeo, saying that he has some concerns about [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=291.86s)]
*  the ICE enforcements that we're seeing on the ground that are the root of this kind of action [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=298.1s)]
*  that we're seeing in Los Angeles County. Do you think that that concern could be parlayed into [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=302.58000000000004s)]
*  something legislative that could either close some of the loopholes that you're talking about, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=308.34000000000003s)]
*  or lead to something a little bit more comprehensive on the immigration front, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=312.74s)]
*  or for people watching who say, well, hope is dead for that, are they right? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=316.58000000000004s)]
*  Hope is not dead. This is the authoritarian playbook, is testing the bounds of your power. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=320.90000000000003s)]
*  You see it in the Democratic backsliding in Latin America and Europe, where would-be strong [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=325.94s)]
*  men are saying, can I get away with this against this judge? Can I get away with this against the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=330.66s)]
*  media? Can I get away with this with the military? Public pressure does matter. When public pressure [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=334.26s)]
*  says no, and the authoritarian pulls back, they deplete their political capital and they become [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=339.86s)]
*  weaker, which is why these peaceable demonstrations against what the president is doing are critical. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=345.54s)]
*  We need to see sustained public pressure, not just in blue cities and states, but in Republican [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=350.1s)]
*  districts, making clear to these members of Congress, we are going to hold you to account [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=355.78s)]
*  to uphold the Constitution. You swore an oath to the Constitution, not to Donald Trump. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=360.02s)]
*  Yeah, and our colleague, Rachel Matto, has done an exceptional job of highlighting those protests, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=363.61999999999995s)]
*  even if they are small in number, they are popping up in interesting places from a political [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=367.85999999999996s)]
*  landscape. So I think this is one that we need to watch. And we're coming into the weekend where [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=372.73999999999995s)]
*  there's going to be those no-kings protests throughout the country in opposition to the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=376.09999999999997s)]
*  military parade that we're going to see here in Washington, D.C. Democratic Congressman Jake [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=381.21999999999997s)]
*  Alkin, class of Massachusetts, thank you for your perspective. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ61e94Fq8E&t=385.14s)]
