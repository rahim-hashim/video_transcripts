# Dems push to strip Trump of authority over law enforcement agency that protects judges
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA)
*  New reports say that the tension between President Trump and judges has become a constitutional [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=0.0s)]
*  crisis, with one former federal judge describing it as all-out war. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=5.04s)]
*  USA Today summarizes the actions that led to this. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=9.64s)]
*  Quote, arresting judges, threatening their impeachment, routinely slamming them on social [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  media and trying to go around them completely. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=18.06s)]
*  The concerns escalating so much that Senator Cory Booker on Thursday introduced legislation [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=21.28s)]
*  to move control of the marshal service, which protects judges, from the executive branch [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=26.66s)]
*  to the judicial branch itself. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=31.9s)]
*  There's concern that Trump could order the marshals to stand down in retaliation for [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=34.7s)]
*  a decision that doesn't go his way, exposing judges to danger at a time when threats against [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=38.74s)]
*  them have escalated, and the president's criticism has too, as rulings go against him. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=44.58s)]
*  Most recently on Friday, when a federal judge ordered the administration to facilitate the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=50.7s)]
*  return of a gay Guatemalan man who was deported to Mexico. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=55.06s)]
*  Joining me now, retired FBI agent Rob D'Amico, former U.S. attorney in Michigan, University [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=59.1s)]
*  of Michigan law school professor and MSNBC legal analyst Barbara McQuade, and former [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=63.86s)]
*  Florida Republican Congressman Carlos Curbelo, an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=68.7s)]
*  Happy Memorial Day to all of you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=73.78s)]
*  Barbara, the Trump administration has not indicated, I should say, to judges that it [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=75.74000000000001s)]
*  or weaken marshals protection for current and former federal judges. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=81.18s)]
*  But given the current state of tensions between the Trump administration and judges, what [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=85.02000000000001s)]
*  are you hearing? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=90.34s)]
*  What are the conversations? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=91.34s)]
*  What's the level of fear that's out there? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=92.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think that this is actually a really interesting and terrific idea. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=94.86000000000001s)]
*  I think judges are very concerned. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=100.78s)]
*  We see the number of threats up. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=102.82000000000001s)]
*  We see things like social media posts intimidating and harassing them. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=105.04s)]
*  We see them receiving pizzas delivered to their homes, which is may sound harmless, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=109.18s)]
*  but it really suggests an intimidation tactic of I know where you live. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=114.38000000000001s)]
*  And because of this clash with the executive branch, I think that having the U.S. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=118.98s)]
*  Marshals Service fall under the judicial branch actually makes a lot of sense because then [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=124.14000000000001s)]
*  the marshals are taking their orders from the judiciary. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=128.78s)]
*  Right now they're taking their orders from the Justice Department. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=133.34s)]
*  The other thing this would create is the ability for judges to truly hold people in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=135.66s)]
*  contempt for their orders because they would have their own law enforcement arm to effectuate [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=141.1s)]
*  those orders. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=146.48s)]
*  Right now, if a judge were to hold someone in contempt, they would be beholden to the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=147.48s)]
*  Justice Department to execute that order. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=151.46s)]
*  So I think it's actually a really great idea. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=153.66s)]
*  One of the things we've seen, Rob, and this is outside of this particular question, but [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=155.62s)]
*  people who have been in a particular government service for a long time being asked to do [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=161.76s)]
*  something that is out of the norm that they don't think is a great idea. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=165.76s)]
*  And that's obviously the concern here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=171.64s)]
*  Right. So how do you develop a security policy for, first of all, a group as large as judges [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=173.23999999999998s)]
*  are under a fast escalating threat level as they are and with this level of uncertainty? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  I think this is actually going back to how society is taking it upon themselves to do threats on [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=187.16s)]
*  both sides. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=193.28s)]
*  I mean, we saw things happen with Tesla because of what he was doing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=194.28s)]
*  Now, the fear of this, I think, is a bit different. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=199.56s)]
*  But I think you'd have to stand up an entirely different service because the marshals have other [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=204.04s)]
*  codes that they're responsible for. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=208.2s)]
*  So I think it could be some thought. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=210.76s)]
*  I think the judges need it because, again, society in general is starting to get more violent and retaliatory. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  So how complicated is this? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it can sound simple like, OK, well, you know, justice used to take care of it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=222.72s)]
*  Now the judges themselves, the judicial branch will. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=228.44s)]
*  But how complicated could a move like that be? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=232.56s)]
*  I think it'd be huge. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=236.56s)]
*  But I think maybe if you take it, the Supreme Court has her own security. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=237.67999999999998s)]
*  And if you take it from there and then decide to, you would have to move funds, but make it from [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=242.2s)]
*  the Supreme Court security and then put it on the federal judges. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=247.76s)]
*  And then obviously, state and locals would have to be on themselves. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=252.68s)]
*  But I think you could form it under that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=256.6s)]
*  And it just beats security for justices, for judges out there and nothing else. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=258.4s)]
*  Congressman, Republicans seem to be piling on to support Trump in this fight with the judiciary. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=263.76s)]
*  And I just wonder what their play is here. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=268.48s)]
*  Is it about loyalty to Trump or do they believe that the federal judiciary is overstepping? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=271.08s)]
*  Well, look, you can believe that the judiciary is overstepping while respecting the separation of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  powers. And on this question, this idea that Senator Booker has brought forward, Congress has its [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=283.32s)]
*  own police force and Congress has its own operation to secure its members and to make sure that it can [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  meet and that it can fulfill its constitutional duty. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=298.24s)]
*  So for conservatives who have for a long time advocated for loyalty to the Constitution, the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=302.56s)]
*  separation of powers, checks and balances, this is something that is consistent with that ideology, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=310.08s)]
*  with that perspective on the United States government. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=316.84s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, we know that Republicans are extremely loyal to Donald Trump, that a lot of them [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  fear primary challenges from the Trump wing of the Republican Party. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  But this is a good opportunity to reaffirm those separation of powers, those conservative [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=329.4s)]
*  principles that Republicans have adhered to for a very long time. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=335.4s)]
*  And Barbara, Trump is not alone in his criticism of judges who have blocked his policies. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=339.88s)]
*  There is now another bill. It's a Republican bill aimed at stopping federal judges, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=345.32s)]
*  district judges from issuing nationwide injunctions. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=350.35999999999996s)]
*  And the attorney general has not been shy in her criticism either. Take a listen. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=353.64s)]
*  What's happened to our judiciary is beyond me. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=359.79999999999995s)]
*  They're deranged is all I can think of. I cannot believe. I think some of these judges think they [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=362.2s)]
*  are beyond and above the law. Calling them deranged. How much has what judges have heard from Trump, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=367.32s)]
*  from Bondi, from Republican congressional leaders exacerbated this security concern? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=374.67999999999995s)]
*  Well, it's hard to know what's cause and what's effect, but certainly the rhetoric doesn't help. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=380.44s)]
*  And we've seen a spike in threats against judges. It's got to be part of it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=385.96s)]
*  But I think one of the things the Trump administration is trying to do is to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=390.44s)]
*  conflate substance with process. They say we have a mandate to be aggressive in [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=394.2s)]
*  enforcing immigration laws. Maybe that's true, but they still have to do it in compliance with [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=398.35999999999996s)]
*  the law. And so these criticisms about judges are really for upholding procedural protections [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  that are constitutionally guaranteed, like the right to due process. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=408.28s)]
*  And so when they engage in this kind of rhetoric, they're certainly free to criticize a judge. But [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=411.47999999999996s)]
*  when they go so far as to call them deranged or to call for their impeachment, I think that rhetoric [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=415.88s)]
*  does cause people out there, somebody who may be a bit unhinged, to hear that and decide they're [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=421.15999999999997s)]
*  going to take action in response. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv1iY96iZA&t=425.79999999999995s)]
