# 'Trying to weaponize FBI through Kash Patel': Rep. Dean slams Trump admin cuts
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0)
*  I want to bring in a member of that House Appropriations Committee, Democratic Congresswoman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=0.0s)]
*  Madeline Dean. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=5.0s)]
*  It's good to see you once again, and I know you're getting ready to head into the hearing, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=6.0s)]
*  but your Democratic colleagues on the committee say the proposed cuts would be disastrous [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=9.96s)]
*  to law enforcement and public safety. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=14.68s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=17.12s)]
*  What's your thoughts? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=18.28s)]
*  Well, as you pointed out, more than $545 million worth of cuts to an agency that is our chief [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=19.28s)]
*  law enforcement agency for the United States, but of course it has such a role to play around [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=28.92s)]
*  the globe. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  At a time, and the testimony from Cash Patel will tell you that at a time of heightened [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  risk and insecurity and threats to our nation at home and abroad, they want a cut. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=40.92s)]
*  They also have a revenge list that they're playing through. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=47.96s)]
*  I just keep thinking of the more than 38,000 members, folks who work for FBI. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=51.0s)]
*  They're not interested in these games. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=58.28s)]
*  They're not interested in the president's revenge tour. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=59.88s)]
*  They're interested in doing their job and keeping Americans safe. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=63.0s)]
*  So we're going to question Mr. Patel very strictly to say why in God's name are they [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=66.44s)]
*  seeking these cuts? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  And also, I believe we will reveal his unfitness for this position. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  It is a critically important position, and the serious cuts that they're talking about [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=77.8s)]
*  are irresponsible. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=83.28s)]
*  Well, let me ask you about some of the things I think you're going to hear, because they [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=85.28s)]
*  are things we have heard before from members of this administration, which is that it makes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=88.4s)]
*  sense to get rid of DEI programs or at least reduce them because they have not made us [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=93.08s)]
*  safer and too much money is spent on PEP projects. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=98.76s)]
*  What would you say to that? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=102.68s)]
*  Nonsense. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=104.68s)]
*  Absolute nonsense. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=105.68s)]
*  What are they afraid of with diversity, equity, inclusion? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  I can't figure that out. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=111.28s)]
*  Businesses know it's a good idea to have a diverse workforce. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=113.32s)]
*  If you're dealing with the entire globe and our safety, I think it matters that you have [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=117.08s)]
*  a diverse workforce that understands the intricacies of different places around the planet or different [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=121.92s)]
*  places around this country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  These so-called PEP projects, I want to go back to what you said about the weaponization. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=129.96s)]
*  You saw in Donald Trump's 120-word statement about FBI and what he wants to see happen [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=135.64s)]
*  there with these deep cuts. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=141.5s)]
*  He wants to get rid of the weaponization of the FBI. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  The deflection in this group is unbelievable. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=147.5s)]
*  They are weaponizing, trying to weaponize through Cash Patel, who is wholly unfit for [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  this job. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=156.74s)]
*  They're trying to weaponize the FBI and keep it from being the independent law enforcement [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=157.82s)]
*  agency that it should be. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=163.06s)]
*  It is really scary. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  It is grave. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=166.9s)]
*  We'll poke holes in that nonsense. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=167.9s)]
*  Meantime, your Pennsylvania House colleague, Congressman Chris D'Aluzio, told NBC News [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=170.22s)]
*  he sees a new divide in the Democratic Party with the real battle not between the center [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=174.46s)]
*  and the left, but he believes it's between fighters and wimps. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  His words. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=183.46s)]
*  Do you agree with him? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=184.46s)]
*  Is that the state of your party? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=186.08s)]
*  I didn't hear the second word. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=188.5s)]
*  The haters and what? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=189.7s)]
*  Wimps. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=190.7s)]
*  He said it's between the fighters and the wimps. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=191.7s)]
*  That reminds me of an old book that Governor Rendell wrote, and he called some people wimps. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=195.3s)]
*  I don't agree with Chris. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=201.46s)]
*  Chris is a talented guy and a fabulous representative, and thank God we have him in our Pennsylvania [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=203.26000000000002s)]
*  delegation. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=208.82000000000002s)]
*  I see in the Democratic Party a people of strong values, the very values that uphold [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=210.06s)]
*  the Constitution of the United States, the very thing that the president this past weekend [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=215.66000000000003s)]
*  said he wasn't sure if he was required to uphold. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=220.26000000000002s)]
*  So no, I'm not characterizing Democrats that way. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=225.82s)]
*  We are people filled with values, and our values happen to be to reveal our diversity. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=227.46s)]
*  What this administration is looking at, take a look at the greater budget. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=234.18s)]
*  I am newly on the Appropriations Committee, delighted to finally have gotten there, having [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=237.7s)]
*  served on appropriations in the Pennsylvania House. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=242.18s)]
*  Take a look at the priorities and the values of this president. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=245.22s)]
*  He wants to cut NIH funding by 40 percent. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=248.86s)]
*  Take us away from being a global leader on research, medical research, for cures and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=252.94s)]
*  treatments, gene therapies and others. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=257.34s)]
*  He wants to take away supplemental food. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=259.74s)]
*  That hurts our seniors. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=262.86s)]
*  This reveals their values, what they care about. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=264.62s)]
*  They want to take away education funding and shutter the Department of Education. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=267.14s)]
*  And all of this is in search of what? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=272.42s)]
*  What they fail to talk about. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=274.74s)]
*  Their end game? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=276.78s)]
*  $4.5 trillion worth of increases, excuse me, tax cuts to the billionaire class. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=277.78s)]
*  Take a look at some of my Republican colleagues, and I'm calling out either the appalling silence [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=285.29999999999995s)]
*  of my Republican colleagues in the Pennsylvania delegation or, as Representative Schmucker [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=289.88s)]
*  has recently said, the cuts aren't deep enough. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=295.17999999999995s)]
*  Well, let's watch this and take a look at whose values reflect American values and reflect [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  our duty, our oath to the Constitution. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=304.86s)]
*  We'll be watching the hearing, and I know you have to go to it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=307.14s)]
*  Congressman Madeline Dean, thank you so much. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=309.7s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ce3Ps17t0&t=311.82s)]
