# Is Florida ready for hurricane season after potential FEMA cuts? Fmr. FEMA administrator weighs in
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ)
*  As of today, hurricane season is officially underway, but upcoming storms aren't the only [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=0.0s)]
*  thing worrying researchers, because experts question how effectively both FEMA and NOAA [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=5.9s)]
*  will be after huge budget and staffing cuts. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=11.72s)]
*  Joining me now is Deanne Criswell, former FEMA administrator. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=15.52s)]
*  Deanne, welcome back to the show. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=18.36s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=19.72s)]
*  So, we saw Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announce that the administration was [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=20.72s)]
*  getting rid of FEMA. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=24.72s)]
*  That was back in March. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=26.16s)]
*  But internal reports reviewed by NBC revealed that she approved a request to retain over [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=28.0s)]
*  2,600 employees whose terms were set to expire. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=33.36s)]
*  So what's happening here? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Why do you think this is all happening? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=39.6s)]
*  I think, you know, Kristi Noem is a governor, was a governor, and so she understands the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=41.44s)]
*  needs that these states are going to have as we're facing hurricane season. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=48.28s)]
*  And with the predictions of yet another above average hurricane season, while everybody [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=52.68s)]
*  will agree that changes can be made, it has to be done in a thoughtful way. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=58.84s)]
*  And to do it quickly and abruptly before hurricane season hits is just going to put everybody [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=62.96s)]
*  in a potentially more vulnerable situation. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=67.88s)]
*  So I think, you know, the realization that, hey, we've got hurricane season upon us, we've [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=70.08s)]
*  got this commission that's looking at things, let's make sure that we have the resources [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=74.4s)]
*  and the people that we need to be ready for this hurricane season, while at the same time [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=78.88s)]
*  we're looking at what kind of efficiencies can we make in the future. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=83.83999999999999s)]
*  Understood on all, but how ready? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  Because FEMA has canceled various management trainings, has limited travel to certain events, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=89.96s)]
*  with no one predicting an above normal hurricane season this year. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=95.44s)]
*  How critical are these trainings for emergency preparedness and how big an impact do you [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  expect these cuts to have? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=103.56s)]
*  I think some of these trainings are going to be critical for some of these smaller jurisdictions [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  when we're talking about the National Fire Academy or the Emergency Management Institute. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=111.44s)]
*  Some of these are the only trainings that they have access to because of limited budgets. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=115.68s)]
*  And when we talk about the personnel, I'll say that the men and the women of FEMA, they [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  are dedicated first responders, dedicated public safety professionals. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=125.28s)]
*  They're going to do what they need to do to make sure that they help the people that are [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  impacted by severe storms. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=133.44000000000003s)]
*  But it's going to be strained, right? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=135.44000000000003s)]
*  They're losing time, which is the most precious commodity we have, and it's going to create [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=137.4s)]
*  delays in getting people on scene quickly or executing contracts to be able to respond [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=142.24s)]
*  as fast as possible. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=147.36s)]
*  Well, today's front page of the Miami Herald reads, Florida says it's ready for hurricane [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=149.16000000000003s)]
*  season with or without FEMA's help. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=154.24s)]
*  Florida's Republican state leaders have dismissed serious concerns about the upcoming hurricane [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=156.56s)]
*  season. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=161.6s)]
*  Didn't know they had meteorological experience. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=162.6s)]
*  But that said, how much do states typically rely on FEMA for disaster relief? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=164.56s)]
*  States and local jurisdictions always have the primary responsibility. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  What FEMA does is come in when the incident itself has exceeded their capabilities. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  And when we're watching a hurricane, we know what the potential impacts are going to be. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=181.12s)]
*  We pre-position resources either in the state or close to where the impact is going to be [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=186.1s)]
*  so they can be able to respond quickly. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=191.0s)]
*  I think about the many hurricanes that hit Florida year after year while I was in my [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=193.0s)]
*  position. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=197.8s)]
*  And we pre-position search and rescue teams. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=198.8s)]
*  And we have an incident management team that sits right with that state director. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=201.8s)]
*  And as they need resources, then they can communicate with each other, and FEMA can [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  then employ those search and rescue teams where the state directs them to do so. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=210.4s)]
*  And so that time piece is so critical of being able to have those resources in place before [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=215.4s)]
*  the storm hits so they can respond quickly. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=219.8s)]
*  And look, when we think about hurricanes, we think about Florida, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=221.8s)]
*  It's it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=226.8s)]
*  I mean, just the way it is, I mean, the topography there, you think about it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=227.8s)]
*  What about something like Hurricane Helene? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=231.8s)]
*  It goes and wallops North Carolina during the Biden administration. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=233.8s)]
*  Is FEMA going to be prepared to be able to help something like that that happens in a place [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=239.8s)]
*  that isn't necessarily as prone? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=244.8s)]
*  I mean, it gets its hurricanes. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=247.8s)]
*  But you know what I mean? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=248.8s)]
*  I mean, Florida gets them all the time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=249.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=250.8s)]
*  Well, North Carolina gets hurricanes all the time, but usually on the coast and not [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=251.8s)]
*  in Appalachia. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=255.8s)]
*  We're seeing these hurricanes impact communities in ways that we have never seen before. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=256.8s)]
*  We talked about Hurricane Helene. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=262.8s)]
*  You mentioned that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=263.8s)]
*  But even Hurricane Ida from a few years ago, it started in southern Louisiana in the New [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=264.8s)]
*  Orleans area. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=271.8s)]
*  It went across the U.S. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=272.8s)]
*  And left out in New York State and it killed dozens of people in New York City from that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=273.8s)]
*  hurricane. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=279.8s)]
*  So these storms are becoming more and more unpredictable about where the successive rainfall [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=280.8s)]
*  is going to happen. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=285.8s)]
*  FEMA, again, the men and women of FEMA, they are going to make sure that they can do everything [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=286.8s)]
*  that they can to be in place and to support those states when they request help. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=291.8s)]
*  But it's going to be strained. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=296.8s)]
*  They've lost some institutional knowledge. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=297.8s)]
*  They've lost some of the personnel and we've always been understaffed according to what [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=300.8s)]
*  our projections were. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=304.8s)]
*  So they will continue to drive and help these states and communities, but it's going to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=306.8s)]
*  be strained. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=310.8s)]
*  And then of the Trump administration disaster declarations, they've either been denied or [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=311.8s)]
*  they've been delayed for weeks. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=315.8s)]
*  How much of this might be coming from FEMA's reduced roll? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=317.8s)]
*  Well, I think that the delay in getting these disaster declarations out there is this constant [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=321.8s)]
*  conversation about what role do we still want FEMA to play. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=328.8s)]
*  And until they have the conversation, until they get the recommendations from this review [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=331.8s)]
*  council, I think that they need to continue to provide the level of consistency that states [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=336.8s)]
*  have come to depend on. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=342.8s)]
*  Because if states can't prepare for what this new type of response or the new type of assistance [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=343.8s)]
*  is going to be, then they're going to be caught off guard and they're not going to be ready to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=349.8s)]
*  be able to support their communities when these storms hit. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=353.8s)]
*  Not just in response, but more importantly during the recovery because that's where the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=356.8s)]
*  rebuilding happens. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=360.8s)]
*  FEMA reimburses them for their rebuilding costs. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=361.8s)]
*  They need to have some kind of an understanding of what can be expected from the federal [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=364.8s)]
*  government to help them with that rebuilding. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=368.8s)]
*  And so it just is going to create delays in the ability to start that recovery process and it [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=370.8s)]
*  can create an opportunity for these communities to be even more vulnerable. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=375.8s)]
*  Diana Criswell, thank you so much for the conversation. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=380.8s)]
*  Appreciate you. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0mA5pJOmQ&t=384.8s)]
