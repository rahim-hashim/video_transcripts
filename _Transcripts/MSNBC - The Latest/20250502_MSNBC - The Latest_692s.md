# ‘New candidate for biggest blunder’: Nicolle Wallace on the latest tariff price hikes set to hit
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw)
*  Hi everyone, happy Friday. It's four o'clock in New York. What's that old expression? That's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=0.0s)]
*  something to do with lipstick and a pig? Well, keep that top of mind. I'm one of the most [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=6.8s)]
*  consequential afternoons of Donald Trump's second term as president. It might surprise [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=11.96s)]
*  you to hear that. After all, what could be more consequential than accidentally sharing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=16.78s)]
*  war plans or gutting national security agencies or musing about deporting American citizens? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Today there is a new candidate for biggest blunder because in terms of in-your-face indicators, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=28.92s)]
*  there are precious few of us that can comfortably ignore what's more noticeable than sudden, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=34.56s)]
*  perhaps dramatic increases to the prices we pay for everyday goods. That is what's happening [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  today from Politico. Quote, Trump's decision to eliminate a special exemption that allows [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=47.36s)]
*  products from mainland China and Hong Kong under $800 to enter the U.S. tariff-free, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=53.1s)]
*  part of his trade offensive against Beijing, are hitting the ever-growing market of online [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=58.78s)]
*  shoppers. Quote, starting Friday, Americans will see the cost of the president's 145 percent [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=64.38s)]
*  tariff on Chinese goods on many packages they order directly from retailers there, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=70.34s)]
*  some with tariff fees clearly displayed on their invoices. If you're waiting for the pig, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=75.66s)]
*  there it is. Where the White House has made a cottage industry out of spinning, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=81.17999999999999s)]
*  BSing, lying these past few months and weeks, there is not enough lipstick in the world, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=86.17999999999999s)]
*  tariffed or otherwise, to cover up the consequences today's development will have on how people [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=91.58s)]
*  actually live and how much things cost them. According to the New York Times, quote, Stanley [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=99.1s)]
*  Black and Decker said on Wednesday that it raised prices on its tools and outdoor products last [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=105.61999999999999s)]
*  month and will raise them again later this year. The German sportswear company Adidas said this [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=110.86s)]
*  week that steeper tariffs would eventually lead to higher prices for U.S. customers. Executives [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=116.53999999999999s)]
*  at Procter & Gamble, which makes products like bounty paper towels and Tide detergent, said last [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=122.66s)]
*  week that the company would most likely increase prices for some products to mitigate the effects [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=129.02s)]
*  of higher tariffs. Officials at Hasbro recently said the toy maker would, quote, have to raise [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=134.54s)]
*  prices, although it would try to minimize the burden on customers. Now, as the American people [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=140.54s)]
*  come to grips with these self-inflicted, man-made, in-your-face indicators, elected Republicans are [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=147.42s)]
*  grappling with a political reckoning that has only just begun, one that could have them out of work [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=155.26s)]
*  come the midterm elections. That development is where we start today with two of our favorite [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=161.98s)]
*  people, two reporters and friends, anchoring correspondent for Bloomberg News, David Gura is [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=166.70000000000002s)]
*  back with me at the table, also joining us MSNBC senior contributing editor, Michelle Norris is here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=171.1s)]
*  It's so great to see both of you. David Gura, a lot of the focus of the tariffs so far, at least on [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=177.58s)]
*  the show, have been on how the market reacted to them and how the Trump cabinet and officials spun [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=184.78s)]
*  them. There's the Orwellian press secretary saying they're not a tax increase. Well, you've got [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=191.02s)]
*  MAGA Republican senators saying tariffs are a tax increase, people like Ted Cruz and others. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=197.82000000000002s)]
*  But the most important part of what was an incompetently rolled out bad piece of policy [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=203.5s)]
*  was always going to be how it affected people, everyday people, small business owners, especially. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=211.34s)]
*  Tell us what's about to happen. So this is the first moment when consumers are going to come [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=217.02s)]
*  face to face with the fact that these are raising prices on all kinds of goods. And I think that's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=221.42000000000002s)]
*  something we've been told is going to happen. You know, something interesting happened before [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=226.78s)]
*  these tariffs went into place in earnest, and that is we saw a lot of goods move from China and other [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  countries to the U.S. to kind of preempt this as much as they could. So warehouses were filled up [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=233.66000000000003s)]
*  with goods that a lot of people here in the United States buy. Now we're seeing Xi'an and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=237.18s)]
*  Timu, these Chinese companies, making changes to their fundamental business models. With Timu, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=242.22s)]
*  you can no longer buy directly from folks in China. It's going to be done through distribution [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=246.94s)]
*  places here in the United States. Xi'an is like Amazon proposed doing. We saw reported earlier in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=250.54s)]
*  the week, going to give consumers an indication of how much prices have gone up as a result of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=255.02s)]
*  these tariffs being in place. They're really going to have to reckon with that. And I think it lays [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=258.62s)]
*  bare a difficulty this administration has had with empathy. And you are somebody, a practitioner of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=262.38s)]
*  political communication, an observer of it. It's something this administration really struggles with. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=267.74s)]
*  So you have Donald Trump in the Oval Office a couple of days ago talking about how you'll [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=272.06s)]
*  only be able to buy two dolls versus 30 dolls. You've heard him talk about groceries, not [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=276.3s)]
*  groceries. It's this kind of old funny word. Howard Lutnick, the Commerce Secretary, was in [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=280.7s)]
*  an interview with CNBC, and he talked about how this is going to affect things that you can't get [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=285.5s)]
*  in the U.S., like mangoes, for instance. They're kind of grasping at things that evince the fact [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=288.94s)]
*  that they're not totally familiar with the way that most people in this country live their lives. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=293.02s)]
*  I think that's the moment that we're in right now. There's been a lot of happy talk. There's been a [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=297.26s)]
*  lot of wishful thinking about how this is going to play out. But the rubber is going to hit the road [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=302.62s)]
*  now, and we're going to begin to see what I think a lot of people have feared now for many weeks. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=305.42s)]
*  Can you just go through what is going to be more expensive and what will be, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=308.86s)]
*  what will cost more even if it's not a direct sort of tariff product? Just how small business [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  owners and how big business owners will sort of deal with products and deal with pricing? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=320.94s)]
*  I don't want to say that it's everything because it's not everything, but it's almost everything. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=327.18s)]
*  Just the way that this economy is structured now, so many products come from overseas, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=330.22s)]
*  and yes, a lot of them come from China, but they're from other countries as well. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=333.82s)]
*  And if you just focus on this de minimis exemption, which has disappeared, and that's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=336.38s)]
*  essentially stuff that's less than $800, it's enough to go through customs. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=340.7s)]
*  Bloomberg did an analysis of that, and four million products were sent every day [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=344.78000000000003s)]
*  in this manner from China to the United States last year. Just a tremendous amount of product. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=349.42s)]
*  Again, it's not everything, but it's almost everything. I think that it's not going to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=353.97999999999996s)]
*  happen in some immediate groundswell where the groceries that you buy or the products that you [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=357.73999999999995s)]
*  buy at the store are going to be immediately expensive, but there's going to be a slow build [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=361.9s)]
*  to that. What we've seen over these last few weeks is companies beginning to figure out what that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=364.53999999999996s)]
*  adjustment is going to be like, how they're going to pass that on to consumers. We're talking a lot [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=369.65999999999997s)]
*  about the main street effects of this now, but we're in this moment when companies are reporting [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=373.34s)]
*  their earnings for the quarter. I can't emphasize enough how many of them are stressing the fact [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=377.5s)]
*  that there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty about their business model going forward, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=382.54s)]
*  but also indicating that this is likely to lead to price increases for folks who buy their products. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=386.86s)]
*  If you were trying to eff up the economy, what would be on that list that Trump hasn't done? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=391.90000000000003s)]
*  Fire the Fed chair, which he's threatened to do and has sort of walked back, but I think that's [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=397.66s)]
*  an example of something where he could further upset the faith and confidence that people have [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=402.22s)]
*  in the U.S. economy today, and I think that it's something that he perhaps recognizes would be [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=407.66s)]
*  a bridge too far in that he has walked back from it. I don't think that his distaste or disagreement [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=412.38s)]
*  with the Fed chair has diminished in any sense, but I think he recognizes the fact that with the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=417.26s)]
*  level of uncertainty and instability that we have right now, removing a principal who is proudly [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=421.9s)]
*  independent overseas, an institution that's been proudly independent for almost a century [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=427.26s)]
*  would be a bridge too far. Michelle, I will forever remember your live reports on Election Day. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=431.42s)]
*  On Election Day, every Election Day is about a lot more than one thing, but [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=439.18s)]
*  one thing that everybody talked about in trying to explain and understand the results [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=445.9s)]
*  was not the price of all things, not the price of things from China, the price of eggs. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=453.9s)]
*  And Donald Trump and his Trumpian two-dollars instead of 30 sort of inability to really [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=460.29999999999995s)]
*  even pretend to understand how normal people live called it the grocery. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=468.53999999999996s)]
*  We had an election in this country that turned in our shorthand political media on the price of eggs. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=473.5s)]
*  Everything that is sort of in the bucket of cost triggers is about to go up, right? I mean, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=481.18s)]
*  and put eggs aside for a moment, but if you've got a kid that dances, costumes are going to go up, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=487.09999999999997s)]
*  shoes are going to go up, tights are going to go up, makeup's going to go up, hair clips are going [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=492.46s)]
*  to go up, kid that plays baseball, cups are more expensive, the pants are more expensive, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=496.06s)]
*  the belt's more expensive, the socks are more expensive, every single thing that you grab for [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=500.62s)]
*  for a family is about to cost more in America. And I am so overwhelmingly, I guess, dismayed [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=506.78000000000003s)]
*  that the Republicans are going to march over the cliff with Trump six months after the American [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=517.98s)]
*  people threw out an entire party over the price of eggs. And you know, there's someone I check [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=523.42s)]
*  with regularly who runs a diner and I check, they explained to me that the price of eggs, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=529.9s)]
*  normally a lot of 15 eggs would cost $35. It's now up to around 150. So the price of eggs is [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=535.02s)]
*  still high. But I like the examples that you gave at the beginning of this when you were talking [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=542.2199999999999s)]
*  about equipment that people use who work with their hands, sports equipment, if your kids are [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=548.06s)]
*  playing sports. If you're shopping at Shane or Tmoo, maybe those are impulse purposes. You might [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=554.38s)]
*  not need that cute lavender cardigan that you have your eyes on. But you know, so many other things [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=559.3399999999999s)]
*  are going to go up that you do need, paper products, cleaning products. You know, if you want to go on [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=565.42s)]
*  a picnic, the paper products that you use for that are going to go up. Everything is going to go up. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=570.8599999999999s)]
*  And what they don't understand is that so many Americans live on the margins, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=574.86s)]
*  live on the margins. And so if everything is going up by 20%, every single category is going up by 20%, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=580.3000000000001s)]
*  this is pushing people closer and closer to the edge. And we're talking about the consumer goods [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=587.5s)]
*  that are going to be more expensive. You know, we haven't talked about the manufacturing chain. So [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=592.3000000000001s)]
*  so many of the things that actually are manufactured here in the U.S. require on parts and equipment, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=596.14s)]
*  gadgets and gadgets that are sourced from overseas. And so when we get into the second [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=601.34s)]
*  and the third quarter, and David certainly knows probably much more about this than I do, but we're [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=606.38s)]
*  going to probably be looking at manufacturing slowdowns. And so that means layoffs. That means [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=609.74s)]
*  people, if they're not laid off, they're not pulling that extra shift. They're just, you know, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=615.34s)]
*  scaling down their manufacturing. So people are going to start to feel this in all kinds of ways. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=620.54s)]
*  And on top of all that, then we start to get something called malaise in the economy. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=625.42s)]
*  And people just don't have the kind of confidence that you would expect with the economy that Donald [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=630.9399999999999s)]
*  Trump inherited. And it's worth repeating that he inherited a very strong economy. And even though [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=635.58s)]
*  people were concerned about the price of eggs and the price of rent and the price of cars and the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=642.22s)]
*  price of gas and everything else, the fundamentals of the economy were essentially pretty strong. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=645.8199999999999s)]
*  And people don't feel that way right now. And so even if he were to reverse the tariffs, even if [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=651.26s)]
*  we could get boats on the water and get equipment over here and get goods over here much quickly, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=655.82s)]
*  much more quickly, the malaise that has settled in around the chaos and the uncertainty in the [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=660.7800000000001s)]
*  economy is going to linger like a hangover, like a bad hangover for a very long time. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIab1k-bkw&t=666.5400000000001s)]
