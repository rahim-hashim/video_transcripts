# Is there an off-ramp in the U.S.-China trade war?
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY)
*  It is day 108. I know it feels like a million and eight, but no, 108 days into the second [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump administration. And today, the major stock indices closed out on a volatile day, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=6.24s)]
*  actually on a high. Investors were weighing the possible two outcomes. One, the upcoming [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=11.8s)]
*  trade, U.S. trade. I can't even get any words out tonight. U.S.-China trade talks that are [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=17.6s)]
*  going to happen over the next few days. And of course, today's Fed decision to not cut [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=22.64s)]
*  rates. The Fed explained its move in a statement saying in part the following quote, uncertainty [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=26.96s)]
*  about the economic outlook has increased further. What does that mean? Tough road could be ahead. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=32.56s)]
*  Why tariffs? And this weekend, Treasury Secretary Scott Besson is set to hold the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=37.92s)]
*  administration's first high level trade talks with Chinese officials. But it remains to be seen if [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=42.56s)]
*  there will be any sort of breakthrough that ends up in a deal. This is what the president said about [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=48.32s)]
*  the talks earlier today. China says in order to have substantive negotiations, you have to bring [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=53.199999999999996s)]
*  down your 145 percent tariffs. Are you open to pulling back your tariffs in order to get China [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=59.04s)]
*  to the negotiating table? No. No. And this morning on Capitol Hill, Secretary Besson was pressed for [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=63.92s)]
*  details about these negotiations. Here's what he said. The trade negotiations will be led by myself [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=70.64s)]
*  and Ambassador Jameson Greer and USTR. And what about Pete Navarro? Sorry? Peter Navarro. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=78.56s)]
*  He will not be joining us in Geneva. Are those negotiations considered advanced? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  As I said, on Saturday we will begin, which I believe is the opposite of advanced. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=95.44s)]
*  Sending a signal to the markets. No, Pete Navarro will not be there. And tonight, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=101.76s)]
*  Trump says he will announce tomorrow morning the first trade agreement since Liberation Day. The [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=106.24s)]
*  New York Times reports it will be with Great Britain. With that, let's bring in our nightcap. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  It is a great one. Evan McNorris Santoro joins us. Reporter for Notis. Philip Bump is here. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  A Washington Post columnist focused largely on the numbers behind the politics. Ahmed Baba is here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=120.08s)]
*  Colonist for The Independent and author of the AhmedBaba.com News. And Dan Nathan is here. CNBC [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=125.52s)]
*  contributor and co-host of the Risk Reversal Podcast. All right, Dan. The world's largest [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=130.72s)]
*  consumer, that is us, and the world's largest manufacturer, that is China, are actually going [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=136.16s)]
*  to take the first crack at easing these trade tensions. What should we expect? Not a whole heck [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=142.64s)]
*  of a lot this weekend. But it's something. Yeah, sure. I mean, again, we go back to the first [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=148.16s)]
*  tariffs that Trump put on China back in 2018, right? It took literally almost two years to get [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=153.52s)]
*  to phase one deal. It was January 2020, right? So this is really probably trying to de-escalate [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=158.72s)]
*  a little bit. I think that this whole idea of off-ramps, I don't know where they exist. I know [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=163.92s)]
*  that there's some reporting today is like, well, maybe fentanyl, some agreement on that front might [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=168.8s)]
*  take the tensions down a little bit. But when I think about China, and you just mentioned as a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=173.44s)]
*  30% of the world's manufacturing, right? And we're one of the biggest importers of their stuff. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=179.04s)]
*  We face the risk of having a supply shock right here and then a demand shock over there. And the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=183.68s)]
*  Chinese economy is very weak right now. It's much weaker than ours heading into this year. So I think [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=190.32s)]
*  that we run the risk of a protracted bear market, even with a bunch of uncertainty this year, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  of just seeing global growth just kind of melt a little bit, right? And that's why I think these [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=200.0s)]
*  bilateral deals, they have to come sooner than later. Even if there's no meat to them, I just [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=204.0s)]
*  think getting some of them out of the way and getting to a point where our allies can get behind [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  us and we can start focusing on China. But for some, it is surprising good news that this is [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=212.88s)]
*  happening because just a couple of weeks ago, China said, we're not doing anything unless you [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=217.6s)]
*  back off on these tariffs. And now China is showing up, at least for the first level of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=223.12s)]
*  these negotiations, and we haven't given up anything. Well, that thing that you mentioned [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  at the beginning of the broadcast with the Fed chair talking about uncertainty rising, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=231.2s)]
*  I don't know how much higher uncertainty can get. Like how much more can there be? We talk about [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=235.68s)]
*  these trade deals, we talk about these conversations, we've seen so many steps get [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=240.4s)]
*  taken and taken back and shifted and go in different direction. You know, I talk to a lot [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=244.56s)]
*  of Republicans, you know, as part of my job, less investors in my job, and they're full of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=249.28s)]
*  uncertainty too, right? They talk a lot about like, we really hope this is going to work. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  We hope these plans are going to come out. We hope this stuff is going to happen for us. But nobody [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=258.32s)]
*  is really like convinced that anything is headed towards a certain direction, I don't think. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=262.48s)]
*  Okay, but you know who else is filled with uncertainty? Everyone. Because we have a president [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=266.48s)]
*  who watches late night movies, escaped to Alcatraz and wakes up the next day and says, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=271.04s)]
*  I'm going to reopen that prison. So everyone's getting all jacked up today. Hey, Scott Besson [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=275.12s)]
*  said Peter Navarro is not coming. I mean, I had like 38 dudes text me like, this is really good [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=279.6s)]
*  news. Navarro is not going to be there. Who are you kidding? Like Peter Navarro was in jail [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=283.76s)]
*  this time last year. He didn't put himself in this administration. Trump did. So this idea that like [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  without Peter Navarro there, it is going to be smooth sailing. It's Donald Trump that at any given [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=294.16s)]
*  moment could say any possible thing about tariffs or anything. Yeah. And he could say no today and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=298.8s)]
*  then tomorrow turn around and change his mind in terms of, you know, using some of the restrictions. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  Or a movie he watched during lunch. Exactly. You watch gung ho and all of a sudden our policies [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=307.68s)]
*  different. I mean, look. I mean, that was an amazing reference. I appreciate it. You just won the show. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=311.68s)]
*  It doesn't matter what the rest of you say for the next 59 minutes. You just read it. It's funny. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=317.92s)]
*  I was talking to Dan downstairs and, you know, I love being here, but every couple of weeks we [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=323.68s)]
*  sit here and we have this same conversation, which is Donald Trump has these tariffs. The [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=328.16s)]
*  markets are hoping that they're going to go away. They don't really look like they're going to, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=332.16s)]
*  but everyone's keeping their fingers crossed. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSY330NUHbY&t=334.88s)]
