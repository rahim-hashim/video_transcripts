# Millions of people ‘could lose their Medicaid’ due to Trump’s megabill: Reporter
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg)
*  Let's bring in our reporters covering all of this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=0.0s)]
*  NBC News senior White House correspondent Gabe Gutierrez, NBC's Ryan Nobles on Capitol [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=3.24s)]
*  Hill, and Leanne Caldwell, who covers the Capitol for Puck. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=7.72s)]
*  Gabe, let's start with the meeting happening right now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  What is the president's message there this morning? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=14.0s)]
*  Hi, Ana. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=15.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=16.92s)]
*  Well, the president is trying to show a unified front here for the Republican Party. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=17.92s)]
*  He's really heaping praise on Speaker Mike Johnson throughout the morning, speaking to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=21.52s)]
*  reporters several times. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=25.84s)]
*  He's right now speaking to the Republican conference behind closed doors. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=27.76s)]
*  We're just getting some video of the ovation that he got as he entered the room. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=32.24s)]
*  And the president is also saying that he does not expect there to be any meaningful cuts [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=36.900000000000006s)]
*  to Medicaid in this one big, beautiful bill that he's touting. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=42.660000000000004s)]
*  He's saying the goal is to focus on just waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  But that might not sit well with some hardline conservatives who do want to see structural [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=50.6s)]
*  reforms to Medicaid in order to bring down deficit. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=55.04s)]
*  The president also appearing to flip on that state and local tax deduction. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=58.96s)]
*  He says that he's not in favor any longer of raising the cap on that deduction. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=63.36s)]
*  That's something that he signaled that he was open to during the campaign. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=68.28s)]
*  But now he says raising it would only benefit Democrat governors in high tax states. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=71.6s)]
*  Again, that might not sit well with some other Republicans. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=77.12s)]
*  The president was also asked if the Republican holdouts at this point were grandstanders. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=80.44s)]
*  He says there are one or two grandstanders, but that they would be to blame as well as [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=85.92s)]
*  Democrats if this mega bill did not pass. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  Ryan, what did those key Republicans on the Hill, some of those holdouts, want to hear [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=95.0s)]
*  from Trump this morning in this meeting? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=100.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if it's so much what they want to hear from Trump, but what Trump wants [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=104.96s)]
*  to say to them and inside the room, my colleagues, Julie Serkin and Melanie Zanona reporting [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=108.52s)]
*  that Trump was very clear with the holdouts on both sides, telling the Republicans to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=113.96s)]
*  agree to the cap that the speaker, Mike Johnson, has set, although the details on that are [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=120.32s)]
*  not exactly 100 percent clear. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=125.12s)]
*  And he's also telling the hardliners on the deficit reductions who want to see those steep [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=127.28s)]
*  Medicaid cuts not to mess with Medicaid. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=132.64s)]
*  He actually used the F word when talking about Medicaid. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=134.84s)]
*  He said, don't F with Medicaid, only focus on fraud and abuse. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=137.76s)]
*  So what Trump is making clear to these House Republicans, those that are right now the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=141.88s)]
*  holdouts in passing this bill, that all sides have to give. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  Nobody is going to get exactly what they want in this package. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=150.44s)]
*  But the package in totality is too important to him and his agenda that they can't mess [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=153.82s)]
*  around with it at this point. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=159.54s)]
*  They need to get it passed. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=160.76s)]
*  Keep in mind, Ana, that Mike Johnson is targeting a possible deadline of the end of this week [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=162.44s)]
*  to get it out of the House and then over to the Senate, because once it gets to the Senate, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=168.56s)]
*  it's going to be a whole other round of negotiations. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=172.76s)]
*  And it's very likely that the bill will change and it could change very dramatically from [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=175.92s)]
*  the way it looks right now in the House of Representatives. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=180.2s)]
*  So Trump making it very clear to these House Republicans not to grandstand, not to try [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  and make a name for themselves by holding out on this bill. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  He wants to see it passed and he wants to see it passed as soon as possible, even if [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=191.52s)]
*  they don't love every aspect of it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  Ana. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  Leigh Ann, the cuts to Medicaid have become a hot button issue around this bill. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  Here's what President Trump said about that just a short time ago as he was heading into [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  this meeting. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=206.4s)]
*  We're not doing any cutting of anything meaningful. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=207.4s)]
*  We're not changing Medicaid and we're not changing Medicare and we're not changing Social Security. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=212.28s)]
*  Here's what I want on Medicaid. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=217.72s)]
*  We're not touching anything. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=220.68s)]
*  Leanne set the record straight. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=223.96s)]
*  How will this bill affect Medicaid? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=225.32s)]
*  Yeah, so estimates show that it could affect as many as eight to ten, sometimes say 13 [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=227.84s)]
*  million people could lose their Medicaid coverage because of this bill. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=235.36s)]
*  The Republican messaging is much different than the reality of what the impacts will [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=238.78s)]
*  be. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  A lot of those impacts are going to come from forced work requirements and new requirements [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=245.04s)]
*  placed on people who receive Medicaid that will drop a lot of people from the rolls, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=250.88s)]
*  in fact. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=256.47999999999996s)]
*  And so this is something that Democrats are intensely focused on. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=257.47999999999996s)]
*  The fact that some of these cuts are going to come depending on when Republicans have [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=261.76s)]
*  this start date of when these new requirements are put in place. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  An earlier version of the bill said not till 2029. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=271.56s)]
*  That is after Trump leaves office. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=275.16s)]
*  And so he wouldn't have to deal with the people who lose their Medicaid coverage. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=277.68s)]
*  The hardliners are demanding that that deadline or that that that start date move up much [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=283.6s)]
*  more to be much more soon. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=288.92s)]
*  And so there could be some political benefits or impacts, I should say. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=292.12s)]
*  But the thing is with this, the president is here at a very pivotal moment. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=297.2s)]
*  No one thinks that this bill can pass without the president. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=303.76s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson has been relying on the president throughout this his entire speakership [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=308.12s)]
*  to get through these very difficult votes. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=314.12s)]
*  And so far, the president has been quite successful. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=316.88s)]
*  And I'm told that the message is going to be that if this bill does not pass this week, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=320.18s)]
*  it's going to be an embarrassment for the president. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=324.68s)]
*  But as far as some of these hot button issues are concerned, Democrats are sure to make [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=328.44s)]
*  this a campaign issue. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=333.68s)]
*  And so, Ryan, talk to us about your reporting as far as the Democrats play now. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=335.6s)]
*  Do they have a plan? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=340.52s)]
*  The Democratic plan right now is basically to allow Republicans to fight with each other [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=344.4s)]
*  and to try and come up with some sort of bill, as Leanne points out, that they can message [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  against. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=354.88000000000005s)]
*  There isn't much the Democrats can do that can stand in the way of this bill passing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=356.16s)]
*  They can offer up their own policy alternatives. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=360.76000000000005s)]
*  They can offer up amendments through this process to try and slow it down. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  That's something that they can do both in the House and in the Senate, but particularly [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=366.52000000000004s)]
*  in the Senate. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=370.0s)]
*  But keep in mind, Anna, that this is a bill that can pass without a single Democratic [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=371.0s)]
*  vote. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  There's enough votes in the House where it is a simple majority. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  And in the Senate, because it's going through the budget reconciliation process, it only [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=378.72s)]
*  requires a simple majority in the Senate as well, which is out of the ordinary. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=381.98s)]
*  So this is all going to be on Republicans to get over the finish line. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=386.52s)]
*  And so what you're going to see Democrats do is show the divisions within the Republican [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=390.12s)]
*  Party, trying to amplify those divisions, and then whatever product emerges as a result [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=394.0s)]
*  of it, try and point out the real world impact that this is going to have on Americans across [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=398.5s)]
*  the board with an eye towards the 2026 midterms. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=402.92s)]
*  They want to make it clear that elections have consequences, and the consequences of [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=406.1s)]
*  the 2024 election will be this package, which they believe will be damaging to many Americans. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=410.18s)]
*  Of course, Republicans feel very differently. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=415.86s)]
*  They think that this bill will go to finally solving the deficit crisis and the debt crisis, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=418.02000000000004s)]
*  which they have been campaigning on for many, many years. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=423.42s)]
*  And, Leigh Ann, Democratic leadership has expressed frustration that this markup is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=425.98s)]
*  scheduled overnight at 1 a.m. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=430.22s)]
*  Here's what they're saying. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=432.5s)]
*  Listen. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=433.5s)]
*  House Republicans are trying to jam this reckless and extreme budget down the throat to the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=436.22s)]
*  American people and hide what's in it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=442.52000000000004s)]
*  Can someone explain to me why they would hold a hearing to advance the bill at 1 a.m. in [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=447.66s)]
*  the morning? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=454.90000000000003s)]
*  1 a.m. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=455.90000000000003s)]
*  1 a.m. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=456.90000000000003s)]
*  If you have a bill that you are proud of, you do not hold the hearing at 1 a.m. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=459.1s)]
*  Leigh Ann, are Republicans trying to sneak stuff through, or is it just sort of the way [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=465.06s)]
*  scheduling works out in a bill like this? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=469.56s)]
*  Well, they would say it's because they need the maximum amount of time in order to nail [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=472.5s)]
*  down the details and that they're giving themselves to 1 a.m. to give them time to get this to [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QM--2DAGg&t=478.62s)]
