# ‘Political malpractice’: Republicans hide as Trump’s tariff policies start to impact consumers
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE)
*  Claire, where is the Congress? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, they have the authority on tariffs. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  This shouldn't be a partisan issue, other than their servitude to Donald Trump. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=8.4s)]
*  But these are jobs. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=13.96s)]
*  These are the kinds of voters that even Donald Trump used to care about, certainly the kinds [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=15.82s)]
*  of voters that Democrats and Republicans fight mightily for during election years. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=20.32s)]
*  Where are the politicians? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=24.92s)]
*  Well, the Republican politicians are nervously studying the polls. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=29.040000000000003s)]
*  Most of them think this is a terrible idea. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=35.68s)]
*  Most of them, frankly, in their bones, are more free traders than trade wars. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=38.28s)]
*  They've watched as Chi has basically given Trump the back of his hand. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=43.64s)]
*  Chi hasn't called and bent a knee. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  Chi knows he doesn't need to worry about his political popularity. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=50.24s)]
*  And he knows the impact is going to be severe, especially it's going to happen quickly [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  and it's going to be all across the country. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=58.06s)]
*  So these Republican members of Congress, right now the Trump base is saying, well, he's doing [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=60.54s)]
*  the right thing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=65.9s)]
*  But they haven't felt it yet. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=66.9s)]
*  Watch what happens when those poll numbers stop to drop among the Trump base. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  Then you'll see some of them regain their sanity or maybe courage. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=73.66s)]
*  On the other hand, there's going to be a really calcified group of Trump supporters that will [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=77.42s)]
*  go anywhere, no matter how bad it is. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=81.26s)]
*  And they're still going to be afraid of them in terms of primaries. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=83.64s)]
*  I've never seen anything like this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=86.54s)]
*  I've never seen so much political malpractice going on around the nation's economy as you're [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=88.14s)]
*  watching right now in the Republican Party. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=96.14s)]
*  I mean, Claire, politics aside, it is a national security issue to have one individual destroy [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=98.02000000000001s)]
*  the global economy and no one says a word. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=106.98s)]
*  It harkens the tree falling in the woods and no one says or does anything. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=112.06s)]
*  Are there not still, are there not enough senators in both parties that believe that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=116.38s)]
*  they should assert their constitutionally mandated check on executive power? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=123.02s)]
*  Well, there's certainly enough in the Democratic Party. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=128.74s)]
*  And as my friends in the Senate that are Democrats say to the Republicans every day, remember [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=131.78s)]
*  this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=136.82s)]
*  Remember this when there's a Democratic president. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=138.0s)]
*  Remember this when there's a D in the White House, because Trump is saying to future presidents, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=140.5s)]
*  you do not have to use Congress for anything, not for funding decisions, not for doing away [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=146.18s)]
*  with whole government agencies, and certainly not for declaring worldwide trade wars. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=152.5s)]
*  And this chicken will come home to roost. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  Now, it's interesting. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=160.86s)]
*  It will see how this turns out, because it may be so bad for the Republicans, the Democrats [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=162.3s)]
*  decide never to even try to go there. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=166.9s)]
*  Let me show you, Mara, more of what Donald Trump says about his responsibility, which [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=169.94s)]
*  again, it's not a partisan observation. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=175.73999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump went and announced a trade war in the Rose Garden with his own charts. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=177.89999999999998s)]
*  He did this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=182.78s)]
*  And I think if it were going well and people liked it, that wouldn't be in dispute. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=183.77999999999997s)]
*  But here he is answering questions about whose economy it is. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=188.7s)]
*  When does it become the Trump economy? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  It partially is right now. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=198.01999999999998s)]
*  And I really mean this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=199.94s)]
*  I think the good parts of the Trump economy and the bad parts of the Biden economy, because [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=200.98s)]
*  he's done a terrible job. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=205.62s)]
*  He did a terrible job on everything from his auto pen, which I'm sure he knew nothing about [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=206.98s)]
*  some of the things he was supposedly signing, to immigration. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  You look at what happened with immigration, how bad it was. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  But sir, you acknowledge when you announced your tariffs, for example, the stock market [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=219.34s)]
*  dropped. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=224.02s)]
*  It's been volatile. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=225.02s)]
*  It has since gone up. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=226.02s)]
*  It is, but now it's going up. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=227.02s)]
*  Do you take responsibility for that? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=228.02s)]
*  Look at today. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=229.02s)]
*  Do you take responsibility when it drops? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=230.10000000000002s)]
*  Ultimately, I take responsibility for everything. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=232.10000000000002s)]
*  But I've only just been here for a little more than three months. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=234.58s)]
*  I think by the time you're four or five, you learn that you don't get to answer questions [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=238.94s)]
*  like that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=243.70000000000002s)]
*  I'm responsible for the parts of my room that are clean, but the messy parts, somebody else [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  did. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=248.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's a ludicrous answer. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=249.14000000000001s)]
*  This is his economy, obviously. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=250.54000000000002s)]
*  It also only took him several months to destroy what had been an extremely strong economy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=253.78s)]
*  Poles will reflect that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=259.78s)]
*  But I'm not only concerned about the cost of consumer items. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=261.53999999999996s)]
*  I'm thinking about the fact that we've had 40-plus years of free trade in place. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=265.46s)]
*  And so what he has done is shock the economy of the country and the world, and we are not [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=269.97999999999996s)]
*  prepared for it, which is to say it's not just the price of consumer goods. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=274.97999999999996s)]
*  It's also the jobs that are going to be lost. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=279.06s)]
*  You don't just get those back immediately once a deal is in place. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=280.94s)]
*  We're talking about small businesses, too, that are going to be hit extremely hard. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  The impact on the American economy, even right now, because it's going to slow hiring. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=289.46000000000004s)]
*  And so I'm actually really already disturbed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=294.90000000000003s)]
*  I mean, yes, we're not technically in a recession. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  But when you actually talk to Americans, especially on the East Coast, I can't speak to elsewhere [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=300.1s)]
*  in the country, people are accepting jobs for less money than they had before. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=305.06s)]
*  It's taking people longer to find them. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=309.06s)]
*  There is a chill already. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=311.1s)]
*  And some of it is the uncertainty, and some of it is the recklessness. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=313.3s)]
*  And so you don't just overnight turn around an economy that was based, a global economy [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=317.21999999999997s)]
*  that was based on free markets and expect there to be no pain. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=322.21999999999997s)]
*  These manufacturing jobs, even if they did come back long term, they're not coming back [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=326.94s)]
*  today when people are losing jobs because they were dock workers or they were truck [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=331.3s)]
*  drivers or they were in retail. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=336.74s)]
*  So what about right now? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=340.14s)]
*  Things are being told by Donald Trump, just order, have fewer baby dolls or you don't [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=342.62s)]
*  need strollers or I don't know what that is. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=348.66s)]
*  I've read it three times now and I read it down. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=351.26s)]
*  She asked about a stroller and he says, what kind of thing? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=354.22s)]
*  What kind of a thing, Claire? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=358.42s)]
*  I mean, you have kids and grandkids. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=359.7s)]
*  The stroller is, I don't know, maybe you know, who's never seen one? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=361.06s)]
*  I don't know what kind of a thing. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=364.58s)]
*  It's a thing that moves around small people. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=365.86s)]
*  Same kind of people that I don't know any kids that have 35 dolls. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=368.7s)]
*  But I mean, the indifference and the window into his almost sociopathical lack of empathy [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=373.3s)]
*  for what it's like to raise a family in this country right now is unbelievable. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=379.06s)]
*  Yeah, and I think what he frankly is so out of touch with how most Americans are living. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=383.82s)]
*  And the reason that we buy a lot of things from China is because they're cheaper. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=391.74s)]
*  And so what he's really doing is he's saying to families who are living paycheck to paycheck, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=397.7s)]
*  well, you're just not going to be able to afford a stroller. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=403.65999999999997s)]
*  And anyone who has had a child knows how essential a stroller is. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=407.74s)]
*  I mean, yes, you can carry a growing baby and a toddler, but in terms of the quality [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=412.65999999999997s)]
*  of life, an inexpensive stroller is a big deal to most families in America. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=419.14s)]
*  And there will no longer be inexpensive strollers. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=425.62s)]
*  The only strollers that you will be able to buy will be less, will be very, very expensive [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=428.58s)]
*  for very poor quality, if in fact they come at all. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOGm8jP2JNE&t=434.14s)]
