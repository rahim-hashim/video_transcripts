# ‘Big beautiful bill’ or ‘tax cuts for billionaires’? House dives into Trump’s budget plan
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA)
*  Let's bring in Democratic Congressman Brendan Boyle, ranking member of the House Budget [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=0.0s)]
*  Committee and a member of the Ways and Means Committee. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=3.92s)]
*  Welcome back to the show, Congressman. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=7.12s)]
*  I think you're just about to head into a markup session. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=8.68s)]
*  What are you expecting and what's the Democratic strategy today? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=11.68s)]
*  Well, it's very simple. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=15.44s)]
*  It's to expose this bill for what it is, a bill that will throw 13.7 million Americans [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  off their healthcare coverage in order to help pay for tax cuts for billionaires. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  That's not me saying it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=29.36s)]
*  That's not any Democrat saying it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=30.56s)]
*  That is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that just recently in the last 24 hours [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=32.64s)]
*  confirmed those exact figures. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=38.08s)]
*  Never before in American history, not even during the Great Depression, have we had an [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=41.08s)]
*  event or legislation that caused more than 10 million Americans to lose their health [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=45.72s)]
*  coverage. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=50.8s)]
*  So this is truly historic and for all the wrong reasons. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=51.8s)]
*  So I saw another preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office that said [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=55.88s)]
*  it would reduce the number of people with healthcare over a decade overall by 8.6 million. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  It is millions of people for sure. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=65.92s)]
*  Have you heard anything, sensed anything from your Republican colleagues that those numbers [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=68.88000000000001s)]
*  alone from the CBO are making them think twice? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  One would think so or one would hope so, but thus far we have not heard peep. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=80.4s)]
*  We've only heard Republican colleagues of mine actually defending the Medicaid cuts, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=85.84s)]
*  pretending that this is all, in their words, waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=92.08s)]
*  The only fraud that's going on is pretending like millions of Americans losing their health [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=96.32s)]
*  insurance is all due to them somehow defrauding the system. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=100.88s)]
*  We intuitively know and the American people know that just isn't so. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=105.9s)]
*  So, Congressman, Republicans aren't wrong, right, about the cost of all of this and the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=110.72000000000001s)]
*  projections about the number of people who are going to need Medicare or Medicaid, going [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  to need long term care. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  We know this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=124.28s)]
*  So can Democrats just say no to the cuts or is there a kind of a long term plan to make [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=125.48s)]
*  sure that this isn't something that keeps getting fought over year after year after [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=131.8s)]
*  year given the number of people who are reaching retirement age? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=136.64s)]
*  You know, the reality is ever since Medicare and Medicaid were created in the mid 1960s, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=141.2s)]
*  there has been strong opposition from ideological conservatives. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  They simply do not believe that government should be providing things like Medicare and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=150.48s)]
*  Medicaid even though the fact of the matter is they are earned benefits. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=155.48s)]
*  They're sometimes called entitlements. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=158.88s)]
*  But the reality is people have out of their paycheck deducted with every single paycheck [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=160.6s)]
*  money they are contributing to the Medicare system. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=165.48s)]
*  In terms of Medicaid, the reality is almost everyone who's on Medicaid is able bodied [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=168.52s)]
*  and working. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  The only folks who aren't primarily are those with disabilities and who physically cannot [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  work. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=180.12s)]
*  So that is another part of the fraud that is going on. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=181.12s)]
*  The argument, the phony argument that is being offered on the other side that somehow this [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=184.4s)]
*  is about getting those who are lazy and not working to start working. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=189.04s)]
*  The reality is again, the Medicaid, especially the recent Medicaid expansion, was mostly [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=194.38s)]
*  due to adding the working poor onto the Medicaid rolls. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=199.9s)]
*  So let me ask about a critical fight among House Republicans. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=204.82s)]
*  We're going to do a little bit of a deep dive. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=208.18s)]
*  You'll know what I'm talking about. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=210.1s)]
*  I want to make sure that our viewers stay with us. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  This is what hasn't been worked out yet. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=214.42s)]
*  It has to do with a cap on the deduction for state and local taxes known as SALT, right? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=215.94s)]
*  It matters a great deal to blue state Republicans, especially from New York state, and they say [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=221.68s)]
*  they will not vote for this bill unless that cap is raised. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=226.6s)]
*  And they have enough votes to sink this whole thing, as I understand it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  But your Ways and Means Committee Chairman is moving forward with his markup anyway. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=234.28s)]
*  Do you think that this is in serious jeopardy? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=239.32s)]
*  Well I have to say, it's not just New York and New Jersey, by the way, also California, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=243.88s)]
*  parts of the Philadelphia area, parts of the Chicago area, a number of places where [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=248.32s)]
*  really the original Trump so-called tax cuts eight years ago were actually a tax increase [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=252.68s)]
*  for a lot of middle class homeowners because they were no longer able to fully deduct their [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=258.08s)]
*  state and local income taxes. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=262.84s)]
*  So there are Republicans in those areas I just outlined that say they will hold out [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=264.76s)]
*  and not vote for the bill. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=269.84s)]
*  I have to say, based on previous votes I've seen around here, once Trump gets on the phone [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=271.4s)]
*  and yells at them, they tend to fold. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=276.44s)]
*  That has been the case over and over again with every previous vote we've had where there [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=278.91999999999996s)]
*  have been Republican holdouts. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  So will this actually be the first time we really see some Republican members stick to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=286.44s)]
*  their guns? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=290.76s)]
*  I'm a little bit doubtful. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=291.76s)]
*  It is going to be fascinating to watch how this unfolds and the stakes are incredibly [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=293.44s)]
*  high. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=297.32s)]
*  Congressman Brendan Boyle, appreciate you coming back on the show. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wbkXdOTZA&t=298.32s)]
