# Protests work: GOP on defense over 'harmful' budget and Musk exit
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8)
*  You begin with the pressure that is actually working. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=0.0s)]
*  If you just big picture say, OK, we're in the second Trump term, and some people have [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=3.72s)]
*  a very strong feeling against him, some for him, others wondering how this was all going [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  to go because they've been pushing. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=11.48s)]
*  Well, there have been a series of bruising setbacks that might partly just be because [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=13.4s)]
*  of reality, meaning what the markets think about tariffs, what other countries think [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=19.96s)]
*  about these threats. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=23.04s)]
*  But some of them have to do with effective pushback. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=24.2s)]
*  In first term, they called that resistance. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  Now it's protesters that have been a part by Musk's own admission of driving him out [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=29.04s)]
*  of government. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=34.76s)]
*  Or take these law firms. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=35.76s)]
*  If you look on your screen and you think about what are the scales of justice even mean? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, usually they mean both sides fighting, not one side just giving up. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=40.56s)]
*  And the law firms who are fighting back in some ways are winning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  And then you have voters pushing back at town halls all around the country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=49.36s)]
*  So that's kind of where we start tonight because Musk is exiting under pressure. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  Republicans are facing pressure after their mega bill is finding a lot of criticism and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=58.24s)]
*  concern, both from Main Street, from red districts, and from Wall Street. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=63.36s)]
*  You have Republican Senator Ernst. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=67.52s)]
*  Her home state is Iowa, which tends to go more conservative lately. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=69.84s)]
*  But the front page of the Des Moines Register shows her at the infamous town hall, where [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  her defense of the idea that Republicans are using this moment to slash your health care [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  cuts to help save money to multimillionaires is, quote, well, we are all going to die. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=85.84s)]
*  That was how she defended the health care cuts setting off this firestorm. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=91.6s)]
*  They are not eligible, so they will be coming off. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=96.8s)]
*  So we people are not well, we all are going to die. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=101.36s)]
*  So for heaven sakes. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=107.92s)]
*  For heaven sakes, Republican Iowa Senator Joni Ernst caused quite a stir with those comments. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=109.92s)]
*  Republicans complete indifference on display at town halls. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=117.2s)]
*  Her response was, well, we're all going to die. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=121.76s)]
*  And that may be true, but you don't have any right to kill me. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=131.84s)]
*  we are all going to perish from this earth. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=145.44s)]
*  So I apologize. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=149.28s)]
*  And I'm really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=151.92s)]
*  That's what passes for a kind of response today. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=159.28s)]
*  You can see she's feeling enough pressure that she has to say something. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=163.84s)]
*  Her staff might have said we could apologize, we could get serious, we could make a joke, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=167.28s)]
*  or we could do this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=171.52s)]
*  She recorded that video in a graveyard and brings up the tooth fairy to try to suggest [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=172.48s)]
*  that anyone criticizing her is somehow juvenile or not getting it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=176.72s)]
*  But the real world impact of the health care bill is what people [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=180.88s)]
*  care about. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  Apparently in Iowa, where this has become a problem for her, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=186.16s)]
*  nine million people across the country could lose their health coverage. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=190.0s)]
*  So the very real question is whether the government is actively taking steps under Republicans [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  that endanger people's current health care, not whether the fact is that we all know we are mortal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=198.48s)]
*  Other Republicans continue squabbling. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=205.04s)]
*  Look, I want to vote for it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=209.28s)]
*  I'm for the tax cuts. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=210.4s)]
*  I voted for the tax cuts before. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  I want the tax cuts to be permanent, but at the same time, I don't want to raise the debt ceiling. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=213.36s)]
*  Five trillion. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  I've got some concerns. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  I think we need to look really, really careful of that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=220.8s)]
*  I continue to maintain my position. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=223.12s)]
*  We should not be cutting Medicaid benefits. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=225.68s)]
*  My loyalty is to the American people, to my kids and grandkids. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  We cannot continue to mortgage their future. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=231.84s)]
*  That's some of the back and forth. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  While I mentioned that real world external forces can also push back on what the government's doing, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=236.32000000000002s)]
*  this government under Trump and the Republicans in control of Congress has been pushing fast, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=242.64s)]
*  breaking things, as they say, in tech land. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, Wall Street thinks the bill won't actually help and may even hurt, damage the broader economy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  And so that's what's happening right now for people tracking as we begin the summer what [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=256.64s)]
*  Republicans want to do with what could be the most far-reaching economic and health care [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=260.8s)]
*  bill of this first year of the Trump term. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=265.84s)]
*  Beyond that, the Wall Street Journal reports that 11 big companies are now moving work away from the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  law firms that settled with the Trump administration or are giving or will give more business to firms [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=273.84s)]
*  that have been targeted but refuse to strike deals. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=278.56s)]
*  Call that a fighting spirit. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=281.12s)]
*  This includes major players. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=283.2s)]
*  Oracle, Morgan Stanley, Microsoft, McDonald's. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=285.28s)]
*  A general counsel saying if firms facing White House pressure don't have a hard line, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=288.4s)]
*  they don't have any line at all. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=292.64s)]
*  In other words, that's the kind of legal business case against just surrendering. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=294.48s)]
*  Separate from who you voted for, these are firms making business decisions saying if you just give [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=300.8s)]
*  into the government on this, you might give into other regulators, government, or entities quickly. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=304.8s)]
*  The protests against Musk have gone on for weeks. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  We've tracked them in some cities, small organic and others larger, more organized, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=314.8s)]
*  sometimes on the side of the road, other times at Tesla dealerships. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=318.8s)]
*  And what we found is that it worked in the sense that Elon Musk left and admits to people [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=323.12s)]
*  that the pressure and this kind of toxification of the Tesla brand [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  by engaging in this kind of politics for him was something that he had to stem. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=338.0s)]
*  He may be rich and powerful, but he had to deal with it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=342.0s)]
*  And he's leaving that government role behind. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  Wondering what your thought is on the ban on foreign students, the proposal. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, you were one of those kids, right? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think we want to stick to, you know, the subject of the day, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=361.6s)]
*  which is like spaceships as opposed to, you know, presidential policy. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=366.24s)]
*  Oh, okay. I was told anything's good, but no, well, no. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=372.08000000000004s)]
*  It's a bit unfair because like Doge became the whooping boy for everything. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  So if there was some cut, real or imagined, everyone would blame Doge. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=383.76s)]
*  That is not the sound of someone doing a victory lap. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=389.68s)]
*  He can see people would blame his efficiency group, which he calls Doge, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=393.76s)]
*  which is also the name of a coin he's invested in. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=397.12s)]
*  But he sees that he sees some things didn't work. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  And he says he became the heat shield for Trump. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=402.32s)]
*  Maybe Trump outsmarted him and knew that he, Elon, could become this sort of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=404.24s)]
*  middle ground. But you also saw in there the spilling out of the pressures because Musk [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=408.24s)]
*  clearly thinks that that interview is about spaceships and his business. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=412.64s)]
*  The interviewer says, no, he doesn't think they agreed to any terms. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=416.08s)]
*  But underneath that is the awareness that Elon Musk, who remember, courted actively being a MAGA [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=419.12s)]
*  leader, wearing the hats, going to the conferences, donning the chainsaw, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  going out to states that were having votes. He wanted that in the headlines. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=429.12s)]
*  Remember, that was very recent. And now he's publicly admitting, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  or maybe he hoped that part would get cut out of the taped interview, but he's admitting, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=436.16s)]
*  no, no, that's not the topic of the day. Well, Mr. Musk, with all due respect, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=439.44s)]
*  that's your topic of the month, months, and frankly, all the way back to the middle of [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=444.32000000000005s)]
*  the campaign season. It was what you wanted to do. And now that you are apparently not liking how [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  it's going or you're losing, you don't want it to be the topic of the day anymore. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  In public service, it's not that simple, because the people had something to say about this [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=457.92s)]
*  towards the government, towards his businesses, towards the markets, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=462.56s)]
*  towards the value of Teslas, and Musk is on the run. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=465.12s)]
*  So there are still, however, the lingering questions about what we just lived through [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=468.96s)]
*  as a government and a nation. Trump wondering whether all of the talk of cuts [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=472.56s)]
*  didn't work or weren't true. The Journal, again, a Murdoch-owned outlet, says, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=478.24s)]
*  was it all quote BS? Trump asked, wondering whether Musk could have ever come close to the cuts. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=483.28s)]
*  He promised. Imagine that, two people who are effective, if at nothing else, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=488.16s)]
*  at spinning PR narratives, eyeing each other and wondering who was spinning who from the beginning. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QlCtNO7-8&t=492.64000000000004s)]
