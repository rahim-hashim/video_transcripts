# ‘Militarization of our communities’: CA Union VP on arrests at L.A. protests
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w)
*  Back to our top story, day four of unrest in Los Angeles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=0.0s)]
*  The protests were sparked Friday after federal agents swarmed three work sites in the LA [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  area. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=10.08s)]
*  Those raids led to more than 40 administrative arrests and one obstruction arrest, according [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=11.08s)]
*  to federal officials. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=16.2s)]
*  Now, the U.S. attorney appeared to confirm the obstruction arrest was David Huerta, the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=17.48s)]
*  president of California's powerful 700,000 strong service employees international union. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Huerta was set to be arraigned today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  He's being treated at a hospital before he was placed in federal custody. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=31.56s)]
*  And joining us now is United Service Workers West Vice President Sandra Diaz. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=35.8s)]
*  Sandra, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=41.04s)]
*  First, have you spoken to David Huerta since his arrest? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=43.16s)]
*  Do you have an update on his condition or any injuries? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=46.36s)]
*  We have been in contact with David Huerta and his physical health. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  He's doing well. He's in good spirits. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=54.36s)]
*  Feels blessed to have so much support from around the country, standing up for justice, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  standing up with immigrant workers. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=64.36s)]
*  And we will see him today. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=67.36s)]
*  We're seeing some video around the time he was arrested. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=69.68s)]
*  The administration says Huerta deliberately obstructed federal agents during that immigration [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=72.80000000000001s)]
*  operation. Your union has said he was beaten for expressing First Amendment rights. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=79.68s)]
*  What kind of test is his case? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=84.84s)]
*  What are the stakes, as he is set to be arraigned today? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=86.84s)]
*  The stakes are high. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=90.6s)]
*  What we're seeing in California today is the militarization of our communities. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=91.8s)]
*  What we're seeing in California for the last several days is the National Guard. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=98.68s)]
*  ICE and the combination of federal agents have gone in our communities with military [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=105.0s)]
*  gear, with tanks, military equipment, on civilians, and all civilians that are exercising the First [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=110.96s)]
*  Amendment right. And we stand by the right to peacefully protest. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  That's one of the pillars of democratic societies around the world. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  We're going to fight for this country to continue to be the leading democratic nation. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=129.84s)]
*  You cannot do that if people cannot peacefully assemble. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=135.68s)]
*  Can you go back to when David was arrested and what went down? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=138.56s)]
*  What's his side of the story in terms of how it all unfolded? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=143.36s)]
*  What we know happened was that David Huerta was advocating for immigrant workers as he's been doing for decades. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=147.6s)]
*  Let me say that again. He's been advocating for immigrant workers for decades. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=154.72s)]
*  And he was assaulted by federal law enforcement, injured, and then taken to the hospital and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=159.68s)]
*  detained. And he was doing what he knows how to do best, 30 years of experience advocating and standing up for immigrant workers. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=168.08s)]
*  The U.S. attorney who was involved in his arrest and will bring the charges in this case said that Huerta deliberately obstructed the immigration agents' access by blocking their vehicle. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  What say you? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=195.68s)]
*  We have seen the statements by the district attorney. And again, we stand by our president, David Huerta. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=199.84s)]
*  We stand by the right that we have to defend immigrant workers. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=209.68s)]
*  We stand by the side of justice. And we will see justice today. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=215.04s)]
*  What do you want people to know about the people who were initially targeted in that ICE operation? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=219.68s)]
*  On Friday, DHS characterized it as 44 administrative arrests. In other words, not criminals. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=228.0s)]
*  Absolutely not criminals. What we saw is a targeting of working people. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=236.0s)]
*  We had people from the garment industry, people that sew your clothes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=240.96s)]
*  People that sew your clothes were targeted. Men and women. We also know that children were targeted at graduation. We also know that pregnant women were targeted. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  When we talk about the kind of country that we are, are we the kind of country that sends federal agents [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=256.88s)]
*  to target children, to target pregnant women, to target elderly, to target people that are sewing our clothes, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=263.68s)]
*  to target workers that are looking to see to mow your lawn, to fix your roof? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=271.36s)]
*  Is this the country that we are? And we stand and say that we're not. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=278.08s)]
*  You have heard LA, LA loud and clear will stand up for immigrant workers and the labor movement will [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=282.56s)]
*  stand and unwaver its commitment to working people and to working immigrants in Los Angeles and throughout the country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=289.84s)]
*  Sandra Diaz, thank you for joining us. Look forward to staying in touch as this unfolds. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue6EUlvX8w&t=296.32s)]
