# What to expect for Pope Francis’ funeral and the conclave to find a new leader
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw)
*  Thousands will surely come here from all corners of the globe and I spoke to one mother and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=0.0s)]
*  daughter from Maryland who came to the Vatican today in a show of respect and with just two [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  days left decided to return tomorrow and wait in line to pay their final goodbyes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=10.24s)]
*  He was an exceptional Pope so we can definitely do that for him. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=18.56s)]
*  He had us at hope so that hope we want to make sure that you know we pay our last visits [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=24.04s)]
*  to him and say our goodbyes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=29.68s)]
*  Are you hoping to be able to say goodbye tomorrow? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=31.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=34.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=35.12s)]
*  Because he was like a good man. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=36.12s)]
*  He was very exceptional. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=37.12s)]
*  My mom had just said he was an exceptional man, an exceptional Pope and I want to be [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=38.12s)]
*  able to go back to school and go back to my classmates and say I pay my last respects [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=43.76s)]
*  towards the Pope. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=49.84s)]
*  NBC's Molly Hunter is here at the Vatican. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=52.56s)]
*  Father Thomas Reese is a senior analyst with the religion news services and joining me [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=54.96s)]
*  Elizabeth Lev, Vatican author, historian and guide. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  So Molly, what more can you tell us about how this process will unfold in the coming [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=62.64s)]
*  days? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=66.84s)]
*  Chris, I just want to say because we are down on St. Peter's Square listening to that interview [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=68.84s)]
*  that you did with the mother daughter, it's incredibly moving. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=74.12s)]
*  You can hear it in their voice and we've been meeting people for the last day that we have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=76.08s)]
*  been here and people feel moved to come here. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=79.64s)]
*  I know that's not what you asked me but we're just surrounded by so many people and the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=82.28s)]
*  next thing kind of on the calendar I should say is at 730 in about half an hour, Chris, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=86.8s)]
*  there will be another recitation of a holy rosary. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=90.8s)]
*  So another opportunity for people to come here and pray together. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  Now tomorrow as you mentioned his body in that wood and zinc coffin, a simple coffin, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=96.72s)]
*  will be lying in state in St. Peter's Basilica and people have told us they plan to line [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  up very early to say their respects to say goodbye. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=106.0s)]
*  Now that is the official event if you will happening tomorrow. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=108.91999999999999s)]
*  On the sidelines though as you mentioned the cardinals from all over the world are coming [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=113.16s)]
*  into town. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=116.88s)]
*  135 this year, electors under the age of 80 are coming and of course cardinals over the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=117.88s)]
*  age of 80, Chris, are also welcome but they're starting these meetings that you mentioned, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=122.76s)]
*  these general congregations. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  Now there are formal chats in the next 15 to 20 days before the conclave starts but [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=127.72s)]
*  there are also informal chats and I know you're going to get into that with your guests but [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=132.28s)]
*  it sounds like from what I can tell from our analysts, from historians, that that's where [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=137.24s)]
*  kind of the real conversations happen that people, these cardinals meet, they talk about [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=140.8s)]
*  the state of the church, they talk about who might be most appropriate, what kind of person, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=145.16s)]
*  what kind of direction might work best for the church and then they get down to specifics [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=149.44s)]
*  possibly in these more informal settings. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=154.08s)]
*  Chris, the other thing I thought was really interesting about this electorate this year, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=156.4s)]
*  it is the biggest conclave. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=160.56s)]
*  I've heard people describe it as almost chaotic simply because these are men who don't know [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  each other very well. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=167.08s)]
*  So in the next two and a half weeks, again we don't know the start of the date of the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=168.2s)]
*  conclave, they will be getting to know each other and that will be a real part of the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=171.88s)]
*  process, Chris. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=175.2s)]
*  Thank you so much for that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=178.28s)]
*  Liz Lev, you and I first met when Pope John Paul passed away and so this is our third [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=179.68s)]
*  conclave I think together, third funeral. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=186.0s)]
*  Talk to me a little bit about that stuff that goes on behind the scenes, whether it's formally [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=188.84s)]
*  and they have those meetings. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=194.2s)]
*  As I know today, the cardinals who were there, about 60 of them took a pledge that they were [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=195.32s)]
*  going to follow church rules, church law in terms of how this all plays out including [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=198.88s)]
*  the conclave but then there are also the informal discussions. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=205.56s)]
*  So there are two things that are happening right now. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=209.76s)]
*  On one hand, there's the simple administration of getting ready for a funeral. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=211.96s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of people are descending to say goodbye to Pope Francis and that funeral [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=215.88s)]
*  has to be arranged. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=220.4s)]
*  As a church, we need administration to continue. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  So there is just some very practical meetings of having to run a church during this period [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=224.32s)]
*  of interregnum or selle vacante. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=229.44s)]
*  But at the same time, the much more exciting event that is happening is that these men, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=232.0s)]
*  these 136 cardinals are all going to come together and start to know each other. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=238.48s)]
*  They've rarely had the opportunity to speak and now they'll have to face the questions [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=243.44s)]
*  of what the church needs to deal with right here and right now. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=247.4s)]
*  And so it's going to be a very interesting period as they begin to think about what direction [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=251.88s)]
*  this church has to take and who they are, the next electors and the next electee. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=256.04s)]
*  Well, Father, of the 135 cardinals I think who are eligible to vote, a hundred-native [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=261.32s)]
*  of them were appointed by Francis, many from places that had never had a cardinal before. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=266.48s)]
*  But do they know each other well? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=271.52s)]
*  What's your sense of the conversations happening behind closed doors? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=273.84s)]
*  Well, that's one of the things that they're going to have to do. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=278.11999999999995s)]
*  And it's a good thing that they have this period before the conclave actually goes on. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=282.88s)]
*  They have a chance over dinner, over coffee, informally to get together in groups and talk [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=291.0s)]
*  about who do we want as pope. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=298.4s)]
*  To get to know one another better, some of these cardinals were just appointed back in [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=302.92s)]
*  September. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  So they need time to get to know each other because, you know, there's three questions [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=309.8s)]
*  that each cardinal is asking about the candidates. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=316.6s)]
*  First of all, does he agree with me on the issues that are facing the church? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=319.88s)]
*  Secondly, do I have a personal relationship with this man? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=325.8s)]
*  I want somebody that I can talk to after he becomes pope. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=329.88s)]
*  And third, how will he be received in my part of the world, in my country? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=334.08s)]
*  You know, for example, American cardinals would not want somebody elected pope who got [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=339.88s)]
*  up and said, oh, the sex abuse crisis, that's nothing, it's creation of the media. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=345.2s)]
*  That would be a disaster for the church in the United States. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  The same thing with cardinals from Muslim countries. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=354.24s)]
*  If the pope got up and said something stupid about Muslims, people would die. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=358.52s)]
*  So each part of the world has different issues that they're concerned about and that they [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=363.8s)]
*  don't want the pope to say the wrong things about. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=370.36s)]
*  So Liz, this conclave is expected to begin sometime in early May. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=375.72s)]
*  We don't know when they have not said yet. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=378.72s)]
*  What is your sense of how this will go? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=382.0s)]
*  You know, there's always a lot of speculation. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=385.32000000000005s)]
*  It's a little bit of a fool's game, but I'm going to ask you to do it anyway. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  How complicated and how open is this conclave? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=392.32000000000005s)]
*  The conclave is a secret process. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=397.12s)]
*  To begin with, what happens is something that we are not privy to, but we can begin to speculate [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  a little bit on what's going to happen. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=405.16s)]
*  I think much depends. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=406.88s)]
*  A big indicator will be how successful these general congregations are. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=408.12s)]
*  So this is an opportunity. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=412.44s)]
*  Perhaps they'll take a little bit longer than usual to meet each other and to have discussions [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=414.16s)]
*  before they enter into conclave, which is really just a period of voting. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=419.0s)]
*  And really, at the end of the day, I think for the Catholic Church, the best possible [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=422.68s)]
*  outcome is a short conclave, something where a new leader doesn't find himself with the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  burden of it took him forever to decide who it was going to be, which allows for much [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=431.56s)]
*  more speculation, but also gives a sense of a church united behind it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=435.24s)]
*  And also for the faithful. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=439.6s)]
*  I mean, right now they are bereft of a Holy Father. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=440.6s)]
*  How long must they be orphaned? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=443.64s)]
*  So I really hope that these congregations are successful and that they will come to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=445.24s)]
*  a peaceful, swift and very hopeful decision about the future. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=448.98s)]
*  Father just talked about some of the characteristics that he thinks people will be looking for. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=453.96000000000004s)]
*  I've heard a lot of conversation around age. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=457.76s)]
*  Maybe the youngest person who's been talked about at 60 would serve too long and people [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=460.68s)]
*  might find that to be a little bit too much. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=465.52s)]
*  But do you have some people in mind or who are you hearing about? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=468.8s)]
*  Because I know you spend a lot of time in these parts. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=472.08s)]
*  I do spend a lot of time in these parts and I do hear a lot of names. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=474.64s)]
*  At the moment, it really feels like it's more like a Rorschach test, an ecclesiastical Rorschach [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=478.68s)]
*  test. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=483.44s)]
*  Tell me who you think is papabile and I'll tell you who you are. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=484.44s)]
*  So it's kind of you can always sort of feel the wishful thinking working. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=486.6s)]
*  I think there is a real interesting possibility for this young cardinal, Cardinal Pizzaballa, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=489.76s)]
*  who's had such an interesting role in the Holy Land. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=494.88s)]
*  But they're also sort of exciting, sort of exotic cardinals. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=499.2s)]
*  There's that sense of anything goes. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=502.0s)]
*  I mean, really, Pope Francis has left this very open field with people from all over [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=504.04s)]
*  the world. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=508.12s)]
*  So I think we do have a lot of different ideas of who it could be. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=509.12s)]
*  The biggest growth in the churches in Africa, is that a possibility? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=513.12s)]
*  It could be a possibility. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=517.1800000000001s)]
*  Again, this is really, it's not a question, I think, of the geographical where's the person [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=518.5200000000001s)]
*  coming from. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=524.0s)]
*  I think what the church is going to be looking for is a way to get its message out, a way [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=525.0s)]
*  to reinvigorate, to excite people, to strong people into the square and really give hope [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=529.8000000000001s)]
*  and faith and especially charity in a very war-torn world. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=536.0s)]
*  Father, because Pope Francis appointed most of the voting cardinals, does that automatically [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=541.36s)]
*  mean they'll support his more inclusive, more liberal, as some people would say, view [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=546.88s)]
*  of the church's mission? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=552.12s)]
*  Well, I doubt that they're going to elect somebody who's going to, after he becomes [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=553.56s)]
*  pope, stands up and says that the papacy of Francis was a disaster and we're going back [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=559.76s)]
*  to the old church. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=565.08s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=566.54s)]
*  I think we're going to see more continuity. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=567.76s)]
*  We also have to recognize there's nobody like Pope Francis in the College of Cardinals, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=571.64s)]
*  nobody with that same personality, that same background. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=577.68s)]
*  It's going to be somebody different, maybe a different style, who knows? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  The church has been pretty good at picking the right man for the right time. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=588.24s)]
*  John Paul II was the right man to be pope when the communist empire, Soviet empire, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=592.12s)]
*  was collapsing and he helped it collapse. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=598.9599999999999s)]
*  Pope Francis was here at the time when migrants and refugees were a big issue, when climate [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=602.3199999999999s)]
*  change became an issue, and he embraced those kinds of issues. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=608.4799999999999s)]
*  And I think that the future pope will also be embracing these issues and working for [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=614.04s)]
*  justice and peace around the world and unity within the church. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=620.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't want to get too far ahead of myself or ourselves in talking about the conclave, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=626.0799999999999s)]
*  but I have to ask you this. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  Everybody knew that when Pope Benedict became pope, it wasn't his first choice. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=633.28s)]
*  He may have been the conclave's first choice, but he was ready to retire and go live with [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=639.04s)]
*  his brother right back in Germany. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=643.48s)]
*  They go into a room of cheers, which is just off to the left of Magnificent Fresco in the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=646.1999999999999s)]
*  Sistine Chapel. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=653.0799999999999s)]
*  Has anybody ever said, no, thanks, but no thanks? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=654.8s)]
*  Oh, we hear stories. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=657.9599999999999s)]
*  We hear stories of popes who have said no. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=659.4799999999999s)]
*  We hear a wonderful story about an electee who had to be sat down by the dean of the [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=661.64s)]
*  College of Cardinals and told, you're going to have to take this job. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=667.0799999999999s)]
*  So it is a very, very, very difficult decision. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=671.0s)]
*  It's a tremendous burden that they're going to have to take on. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwviTVePLFw&t=673.64s)]
