# Harvard professor Laurence Tribe reacts to Trump’s latest attacks on Harvard University
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q)
*  This morning on social media, Donald Trump once again attacked the oldest university [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=0.0s)]
*  in America, saying, we are still waiting for the foreign student lists from Harvard so [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=6.44s)]
*  that we can determine after a ridiculous expenditure of billions of dollars how many radicalized [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=13.96s)]
*  lunatics, troublemakers all, should not be let back into our country. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=19.68s)]
*  Harvard is very slow in the presentation of these documents and probably for good reason. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=25.6s)]
*  The best thing Harvard has going for it is that they have shopped around and found the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=31.0s)]
*  absolute best judge for them, but have no fear the government will in the end win. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=35.56s)]
*  I am considering taking $3 billion of grant money away from a very anti-Semitic Harvard [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=42.0s)]
*  and giving it to trade schools all across our land. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  What a great investment that would be for the USA and so badly needed. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=52.7s)]
*  Joining our discussion now is Professor Lawrence Tribe, who has taught constitutional law at [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=57.86s)]
*  Harvard Law School for five decades. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=61.980000000000004s)]
*  Professor Tribe, what is your response to Donald Trump's latest attack? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=65.10000000000001s)]
*  It's really hard, Lawrence, to know where to begin. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=70.34s)]
*  He's obviously unhinged. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=73.06s)]
*  He has no idea what he's talking about. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=74.9s)]
*  He just thinks that slinging around frankly BS about the people at Harvard and other institutions [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=77.74s)]
*  will somehow substitute for taking the law into account. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=87.53999999999999s)]
*  He has been throwing everything he can at Harvard and courts have put a stop to it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=93.33999999999999s)]
*  There was no judge shopping. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=100.17999999999999s)]
*  The district court that happens to have the other Harvard case, the federal district court [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=103.92s)]
*  in Boston with a very capable judge, Allison Burroughs, obviously has this case. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  It's closely related. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=122.72s)]
*  This case involves Trump's attempt to tell Harvard that it can no longer host foreign [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=124.32s)]
*  students. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=132.2s)]
*  Now, that's crazy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=133.2s)]
*  There's no legal basis for it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=134.6s)]
*  He's talking about information that he would like about students. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  He wants to know details about what they say, what they think. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  That's a violation of the First Amendment. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  But put it in perspective, Harvard is going to admit about 25,000 new students. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  They're entering in four months. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=155.67999999999998s)]
*  18,000 of them are Americans. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  Those 18,000 eagerly await something like 7,000 foreign students. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=162.28s)]
*  Trump is trying to basically frighten into throwing away their hard-thought, well-earned [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  admission letter, a letter that tells them they are the best and the brightest from around [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=178.32s)]
*  the world. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=184.2s)]
*  And he's doing that by threatening with no legal basis Harvard's right to admit them. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  There's a program called the Student Exchange Visitor Program. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=192.56s)]
*  For 70 years, Harvard has been admitting the most brilliant students and scholars from [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=196.64s)]
*  around the world. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  They are welcomed not only by Harvard, but by the United States, because what they learn, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=204.64s)]
*  what they discover, benefits the country, benefits the country and benefits the health [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=212.44s)]
*  and welfare of all Americans. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=219.48s)]
*  We used to have a program. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=223.72s)]
*  It was called Operation Paperclip to attract the most brilliant students from the countries [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=224.96s)]
*  we defeated in World War II. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=231.86s)]
*  Many of the people who came to this country, like Albert Einstein, made this a mecca of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=236.2s)]
*  discovery and learning. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=242.32s)]
*  But obviously, this is a president who hates intellect, who despises the symbol of excellence [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=245.48s)]
*  in the world of higher education around the world. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=256.28s)]
*  He thinks he can score points by attacking Harvard. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=260.68s)]
*  But I have a message, and it's a message that I wouldn't bother delivering to him. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=264.12s)]
*  I don't know that he'd understand it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=268.92s)]
*  But a message to those seven students, those 7,000 students, that he's trying to frighten [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=271.16s)]
*  away. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=276.88s)]
*  Don't be scared. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=279.0s)]
*  This guy is a paper tiger. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=281.1s)]
*  He's a tin horned tyrant. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=283.0s)]
*  In the month of May, there were all kinds of cases across the country. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=286.88s)]
*  Judges appointed by Republicans and Democrats involving Donald Trump and his megalomaniac [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=292.28s)]
*  attacks on all of our institutions. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=299.52s)]
*  And you know what his record was? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  He lost over 95% of them. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=304.86s)]
*  Just a couple of hours after his lawless and savage claim that he was going to shut down [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=310.36s)]
*  Harvard as a host for foreign students. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  Just a couple of hours after that, of course, Judge Burroughs entered a temporary restraining [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=322.08s)]
*  order. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=328.36s)]
*  She's going to hold a hearing this Thursday. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=329.36s)]
*  I will be interested in hearing what in the world Harvard will confront, what in the world [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=332.52s)]
*  Trump's lawyers can possibly argue. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=342.08s)]
*  There is no law that justifies what they're trying to do and their attempt to retaliate [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=345.16s)]
*  against Harvard for not turning over all kinds of information to which they have no right [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=351.86s)]
*  in violation of the privacy of these students, retaliating against Harvard for having a curriculum [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=357.98s)]
*  that this president doesn't like, not that he understands it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=365.36s)]
*  That retaliation is flagrantly and flatly unconstitutional. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=370.98s)]
*  Among other things, picking out by name a particular institution is what the framers [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=375.92s)]
*  of our Constitution called a bill of attainder. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=382.8s)]
*  He is trying to basically destroy a particular institution and then he'll turn to others. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  But right now he's named one and 7,000 identifiable students who've been admitted. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=394.42s)]
*  He knows their names. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=401.36s)]
*  It's not a secret. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=402.88s)]
*  They have admission letters. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=404.16s)]
*  He's trying to target all of these people for retaliation. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=405.8s)]
*  So if you want to know what my answer is, my answer is see you in court, Mr. President. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=411.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, this demand he makes today, he says he's waiting for the foreign student lists [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=418.9s)]
*  from Harvard. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  All of their visas are granted by the State Department, every one of them. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=427.67999999999995s)]
*  The State Department knows every single student visa that is issued. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  And so part of the madness that he spews just includes stuff like that that is not, doesn't [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  require some kind of special discovery from Harvard or from any institution. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=446.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=453.44000000000005s)]
*  In fact, that's the story of this whole case. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=454.44000000000005s)]
*  He keeps coming up with crazy demands, either for information he already has or for information [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=457.32000000000005s)]
*  he has no right to have. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=463.76000000000005s)]
*  He wants to know what the, basically if you read closely what he's asking for, he basically [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=465.72s)]
*  wants to know what these students are going to read. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=474.12s)]
*  He would love to know what they're going to say, what they're going to think. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=477.1s)]
*  He wants to be confident that they won't join any protests against Israel's war in [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=480.62s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=488.54s)]
*  It's all an attempt to take over the intellectual underpinnings of a private university. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=490.02s)]
*  Anybody who isn't connected to Harvard shouldn't feel confident that they won't be next. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=501.02000000000004s)]
*  The one thing we have going for us is the law. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=509.24s)]
*  And what is clear is that federal courts, regardless of who appointed them, have some [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=512.9s)]
*  fidelity to the law. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=518.72s)]
*  They actually care about it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=520.26s)]
*  And they have been successful very quickly in telling Trump to stop. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=522.38s)]
*  Now, it is true that no member of the Trump administration has yet been held in contempt. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=528.24s)]
*  But just wait. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=535.8000000000001s)]
*  Proceedings are underway. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  Contempt findings and criminal contempt findings are not at all unlikely. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=540.28s)]
*  And the only reason that's taking time is that our judges are trying very hard to make [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=545.32s)]
*  absolutely sure that they dot every I, cross every T, and that their contempt adjudications [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=551.28s)]
*  will be upheld. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=558.1s)]
*  Then Trump is likely to say, well, they've been held in contempt, but I'm going to pardon [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=560.02s)]
*  them. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=566.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, the pardon power doesn't really extend to contempt of court when it's criminal contempt [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=567.6999999999999s)]
*  inherent in the court's own power. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=573.9399999999999s)]
*  He likes to pardon people if they are on his side and if they engage in violence, but that [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=577.6s)]
*  isn't going to help here. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=586.4200000000001s)]
*  So clearly, it's not a situation in which students ought to be scared, although it's [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=588.08s)]
*  hard to blame them. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=594.1600000000001s)]
*  It's not so hard for me. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=596.36s)]
*  Somebody who was born to Russian Jewish refugees in war-torn Shanghai, who was welcomed to [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=598.6800000000001s)]
*  this country at the end of World War II to honor the people who sacrificed their lives [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=607.0s)]
*  so we could enjoy the fruits of freedom. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=613.52s)]
*  And it's pretty easy for me to see Memorial Day as an occasion to stand up to somebody [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=616.9200000000001s)]
*  like this tyrant. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=622.0600000000001s)]
*  It's harder for lots of foreign students who face these threats and wonder, am I safe? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=624.08s)]
*  But the siren of safety in succumbing to lawless power is really illusory. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=630.74s)]
*  If you give up in advance, that's when you're not safe. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=638.9s)]
*  But trust me, Harvard has your back because you are crucial to us and to our survival. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=643.98s)]
*  The intellect that you bring to Harvard and to the country is something we value and need, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=652.62s)]
*  so we're on your side. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=660.52s)]
*  And America's judges have your back because your prevailing over Trump in this lawless [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=663.0s)]
*  war he is waging on the mind is vital to our courts and their survival as keepers of the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=670.94s)]
*  flame of the rule of law. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=681.2s)]
*  So yes, you've got an enemy in this deranged Donald Trump, but you've got millions of [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=684.28s)]
*  friends and they will support you. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=690.74s)]

*  is as serious as hell. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DEvYfiR4Q&t=709.86s)]
