# Martyr or an example? Rieckhoff on Trump setting precedent with Newsom
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE)
*  And just moments ago Donald Trump was taking questions at the White House on the situation in Los Angeles. We've got some sound for you now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=0.0s)]
*  It seems like Gavin Newsom likes the attention that he's getting right now from you it seems like he does [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=12.16s)]
*  He if you look at recent history [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=19.76s)]
*  Somebody who was running for president you who got arrested and had a mugshot [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=22.6s)]
*  You could make the argument that politically that wound up helping you [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=26.96s)]
*  Are you worried at all at this moment the talking about him getting arrested could be helpful to his political? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  Prospects because a lot of people think he wants to be sitting right where you are [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=38.36s)]
*  Well in my case it was a witch hunt and everybody knew it and I was able to explain that during the process [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=41.96s)]
*  Otherwise, I wouldn't be sitting here right now [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=47.0s)]
*  And it was a total witch I'd disprove it to be a witch hunt and you see what's happened in his case [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=48.92s)]
*  It really is very obvious you look at what's happened between the fires [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=53.96s)]
*  Between it I could name ten things right now. We talk about the trains [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  We talk about all of the costs in California [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  You talk about all of the people that are flowing and destroying life for everyone else [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  So no, I don't think it's gonna help him [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=71.4s)]
*  I think it's I think it's actually very bad for him right around the time that we were walking in here the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  Governor and the state attorney general said that they're gonna sue you for sending the National Guard and they're saying there's no invasion [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=78.98s)]
*  There's no rebellion the president is trying to manufacture [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  Chaos and crisis on the ground for his own [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=88.9s)]
*  Political ends federalizing the California National Guard is an abuse of the president's authority under law [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, it's interesting you watch the same clips as I did [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=98.78s)]
*  Cars burning all over the place people riding and by the way, we stopped it [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=102.62s)]
*  We were able to make it much better, but it still looked pretty bad and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=106.66s)]
*  In watching clips last night people were saying this is really a big problem [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=111.38s)]
*  And until we went in if we didn't do the job that place would be burning down just like the houses burned down [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=115.7s)]
*  They were in big trouble last night Peter [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=121.22s)]
*  You know it and the night before and the night before that and I feel we had no choice [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=123.22s)]
*  I don't want to see I don't want to see happen what what happened so many times in this country [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=128.1s)]
*  Minneapolis burn I watched look at what happened in so many different parts of California [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=135.02s)]
*  You take a look at what happened in San Diego [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=140.58s)]
*  There's so many different places where we let it burn. We want to be politically correct. We wanted to be nice [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=143.5s)]
*  We want to be nice to the criminal and what you're doing is destroying the fabric of our life in this country [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=150.22s)]
*  No, we we did the right thing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=155.7s)]
*  We've been given credit for my people that I would least suspect why I would say that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=157.78s)]
*  Some of the people that came in and said thank goodness. They said some of them [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=163.42s)]
*  Thank God that Trump got involved and I'm very happy I got involved and I think Gavin in his own way is probably happy [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=168.1s)]
*  I got involved. Yeah, go ahead [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=176.04s)]
*  What do you make of the fact that he says you want a civil war on the streets of America? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  No, it's just the opposite. I don't want a civil war [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=184.42s)]
*  Civil war would happen if you left it if you left it to people like him and I liked him, you know [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=187.73999999999998s)]
*  I always got along with him never had a problem with him, but he's grossly incompetent. Okay [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=192.82s)]
*  All right [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=202.26s)]
*  That was President Trump speaking at event in the White House answering questions about the decision to send the National Guard to Los Angeles [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=202.88s)]
*  He was being grilled there a bit by Peter Ducey from Fox News [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=209.82s)]
*  One of the things he was asked was [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=213.46s)]
*  Whether or not it could be actually good for Governor Newsom or whether he thought he he needed to do this and the president [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=216.22s)]
*  Said he'd been watching hours of television [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=222.38s)]
*  He'd been watching the images and people say something we hear from the president a lot people said we needed to do something [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=224.5s)]
*  Trump said quote I feel we had no choice now that obviously has been disputed by California officials and many other watchers [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=229.86s)]
*  Including possibly our own here at MSNBC [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=236.94s)]
*  And I want to go now to the executive director of more perfect union Fahz Shakir [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=239.06s)]
*  Peter Baker and Paul Ryckoff Paul. I want to start with you [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=244.38s)]
*  What is your take on what we just heard from the president that he had no choice? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=248.45999999999998s)]
*  But to send the National Guard in even though the governor said we don't need him [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  Trump is on plan. This has been the plan Trump has selected, California [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=258.38s)]
*  He's selected Los Angeles and he selected Gavin Newsom to wage this first political battle [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=263.06s)]
*  With a governor and and he has been dictating the pace and the terms of everything for the last couple of months [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=269.02s)]
*  And he's now challenging Newsom and the Democrats and America to stop him [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=275.5s)]
*  Whether or not this is bad for Newsom or bad for Trump. It's bad for America. It's bad for our democracy [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=280.65999999999997s)]
*  It's bad for the troops in uniform. It's bad for ice. It's bad for the protesters [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=286.34s)]
*  It's bad for everyone who it's not bad for is Vladimir Putin and North Korea and any other enemies that want to celebrate America [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=290.32s)]
*  Divided so I think this is a test case for Trump on whether or not he can roll over [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=298.24s)]
*  Newsom is is Newsom gonna be a martyr or is he gonna be an example of what can happen in other states? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=303.56s)]
*  But I think Trump is on plan [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=309.08s)]
*  He's moving forward and he's gonna continue to do this and challenge other governors in days to come [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=310.52s)]
*  But he picked Newsom and now now it's on [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=315.44s)]
*  Here to that point Trump has been picking a fight with Gavin Newsom for years [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=318.28s)]
*  Obviously probably because of his potential presidential aspirations, but there's a bit of why are you so obsessed with me going on here? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=322.8s)]
*  You know Trump is president. He's in the Oval Office. He is term limited [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=329.96s)]
*  Why does he care so much about who potentially runs in 2028 and should that tell us something? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=334.4s)]
*  Well, Trump always operates better when he has an enemy right politically speaking [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=340.2s)]
*  He is most comfortable when he has somebody to go after and at the moment he doesn't have a challenger, right? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  He doesn't have a you know another candidate to go after and so he's looking for for people to to contend with he likes [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  To mix it up in some ways Gavin Newsom is an obvious [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=356.92s)]
*  You know antagonist. He's the head of the largest state in the country [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=360.56s)]
*  He's the head of a state that is seen as an example of liberal America [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=364.12s)]
*  Which Trump is targeting in so many ways through academia through law firms through [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=368.06s)]
*  You know the news organizations and so on he you know Trump believes that he or at least is [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  Given the idea that he is deconstructing the liberal state as it were and that's as it's developed over the last number of generations [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=378.04s)]
*  And in some ways Gavin Newsom represents that he represents the state that represents that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=384.12s)]
*  It's also you know Newsom is a pugilist as well. He has some of the Trumpian qualities [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=388.32s)]
*  He's willing to get out there and mix it up himself. He doesn't mind a good scrap politically [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=392.8s)]
*  I think he likes being the one who will take on Donald Trump and being [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=396.68s)]
*  You know the the one person that Trump seems most eager to fight with it works for him [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=401.71999999999997s)]
*  It works for him politically [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=407.8s)]
*  But I think you know as we just said obviously there are a lot of real people involved here too in politics given that we're three [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=409.0s)]
*  And a half years away from a presidential election seemed pretty pretty small compared to the stakes involved for a lot of real people [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=414.38s)]
*  Who are facing you know? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=420.2s)]
*  Both situations of the streets and situations with ice and situations, you know in so many other ways [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=422.2s)]
*  And [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=427.44s)]
*  Fuzz we just heard the president get asked that very question which is is Trump actually handing Governor Newsom a potential opportunity here [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=428.59999999999997s)]
*  There's been a lot of talk about how the response and the pockets are kind of playing into Trump's hand [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=436.35999999999996s)]
*  But is Trump also playing into the worst vilifications Democrats like Newsom have tried to paint his administration [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=441.79999999999995s)]
*  Do you think Newsom will try to use this to take on Trump head-on? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=448.5s)]
*  He's effectively doing it already government is and if you listen to that answer just like I heard it for the first time just like [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=452.88s)]
*  You did and if you listen to him he said well the attacks on me were a witch on these these on Gavin Newsom are not [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=459.2s)]
*  Because he's doing things with rails and costs and immigrants running into his kind into his state [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=465.76s)]
*  Therefore he needs to be jailed that that seems to be the implication that Donald Trump is leaving you with that that has [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=472.48s)]
*  Somehow risen to the cause of for the first time in American history [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=478.92s)]
*  Putting a governor a president putting a governor in jail. That's crazy, right? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=484.08s)]
*  And but why is he doing this and I agree with all of your other guests that he not only needs a foil [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=487.48s)]
*  He not only needs a distraction. Why is he doing it? Because he had the wrong foils and he had the wrong distractions last week [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=493.64s)]
*  So if you walked all of through Monday through Thursday, we were dealing with two major things [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=500.04s)]
*  Elon Musk was at war with Donald Trump and you had the breakdown of a big beautiful bill which continues to be a big problem [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=504.36s)]
*  in this in the Republican Senate [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=511.48s)]
*  So instead of having a discourse about the fights on the right and the Republicans having all kinds of disputes about this and then with [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=513.8000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk the most powerful man on the planet. He has now chosen purposefully to distract everybody and say hey [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=520.28s)]
*  You know, I'm gonna send Homeland Security agents into LA cause a curb-fuffle [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=526.24s)]
*  And hopefully everybody will shift their attention over to this and I'll have it out with a fun and entertaining fight with Gavin Newsom [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=530.0400000000001s)]
*  That is authoritarian nature. I [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=536.4000000000001s)]
*  Do want to point out the White House has walked back those threats to potentially arrest the governor or the mayor of LA [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=538.6s)]
*  But that doesn't mean the rhetoric is backing down on either side and faz we've got new some [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=544.6s)]
*  Challenge the Trump administration to escalate things. Take a listen [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=549.52s)]
*  He knows where to find me but you know what? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=553.84s)]
*  Let your hands off four-year-old girls that are trying to get educated [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  Let your hands off these poor people. They're just trying to get live their lives man [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=561.3199999999999s)]
*  Trying to live their lives paying their taxes been here ten years the fear [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVe4HlmHGKE&t=565.92s)]
