# 'A complete stunner of an election': Liberals win Canadian election that became Trump-focused
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg)
*  wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=0.0s)]
*  Never. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=6.0s)]
*  But these are not, these are not idle threats. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=9.0s)]
*  President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=13.0s)]
*  That will never, that will never ever happen. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=20.0s)]
*  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney sending a clear and strong message to his country and to the White House [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=25.0s)]
*  as he prepares to lead his nation through a trade war that his country did not ask for. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=31.0s)]
*  Carney and his Liberal Party secured a narrow victory last night [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=36.0s)]
*  and while Conservatives did gain seats in Parliament, the Conservative leader lost his own seat. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=40.0s)]
*  Months ago, these results, they seemed improbable. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=46.0s)]
*  The Liberal Party was bleeding support after maintaining control of Canada for over a decade. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=49.0s)]
*  But in the aftermath, the former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=54.0s)]
*  and Donald Trump waging a trade war on the nation he derided as America's 51st state, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=58.0s)]
*  the Liberal Party capitalized on the push within the country to fight back against Trump and Trumpism. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=63.0s)]
*  Carney is set to host Trump as part of the G7 summit in mid-June [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=69.0s)]
*  as steep tariffs remain in place between the two nations. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=73.0s)]
*  Joining us from outside the White House, CBC News DC correspondent Richard Madden. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=77.0s)]
*  Charlie is back with us. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=81.0s)]
*  Alright Richard, what is the mood in Canada after the aftermath of these results? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=83.0s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=87.0s)]
*  I think the mood could be summed up as surprising and a complete stunner of an election. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=89.0s)]
*  As you noted off the top, the Liberal Party of Canada's brand was underwater. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=94.0s)]
*  Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's polling numbers were dismal [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=99.0s)]
*  and they were set to head to an absolute obliteration on election day. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=103.0s)]
*  But when Mark Carney replaced Justin Trudeau as a leader of the party [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=109.0s)]
*  and eventually Prime Minister, he made fighting Trump and his tariffs the centerpiece, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=112.0s)]
*  the cornerstone of his campaign. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=118.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump wasn't on the ballot in Canada, but he was sure the elephant in the room. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=120.0s)]
*  When Canadians went to the ballot box, they were faced with a choice. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=124.0s)]
*  It was either change or who's strongest to stand up to current President Donald Trump. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=128.0s)]
*  And extraordinarily, Trump himself posted on a social media site [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=134.0s)]
*  the day Canadians went to the election, basically endorsing himself, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=138.0s)]
*  throwing those insults about the 51st state. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=142.0s)]
*  And that really, in a sense, tipped the scales to Mark Carney [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=145.0s)]
*  to really bring his party up from the ashes and lead a minority government in Parliament. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=148.0s)]
*  Charlie, I saw your facial response when you heard that Donald Trump managed to somehow get on social media, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=153.0s)]
*  affect the results of an election and what I think he would perceive to be the wrong election. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=160.0s)]
*  That is the message discipline that we are accustomed to. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=164.0s)]
*  Yeah, for people who think that Donald Trump always has a strategy, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=169.0s)]
*  that he's playing for a dimensional chess, what is the strategy here? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=173.0s)]
*  He managed to tank the Conservative Party of Canada. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=176.0s)]
*  He had a chance to see the election of somebody who would be kind of an ally. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=180.0s)]
*  And what did he do? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=184.0s)]
*  By continually trolling Canada, by pushing this absurd, ridiculous idea [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=186.0s)]
*  that they should become our 51st state. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=191.0s)]
*  He has alienated one of our oldest and closest allies and friends. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=193.0s)]
*  And I think the most disturbing thing about this is what it's long-term, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=198.0s)]
*  the long-term damage that it's done to our relationships with our neighbors. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=203.0s)]
*  It's one thing to lose an election, but before Donald Trump came on the scene, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=208.0s)]
*  was any American actually mad at Canada? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=213.0s)]
*  Was there any reason for Canada not to trust and like America? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=216.0s)]
*  And look where we are right now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=219.0s)]
*  We're seeing this pattern all around the world where America first became America alone [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=221.0s)]
*  and so many of our friends now wonder, are we still friends? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=226.0s)]
*  Can we trust you? Can we rely on you? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=229.0s)]
*  And are we ever going to be able to put that relationship back? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=231.0s)]
*  And I think it's going to be much more difficult than we think. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=235.0s)]
*  But again, what an extraordinary turnaround in Canadian politics, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=238.0s)]
*  almost completely because Donald Trump mishandled his own politics so badly. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=243.0s)]
*  Richard, America first becomes America alone, becomes America last, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=250.0s)]
*  and that is in part because you have folks like Mark Carney saying, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=256.0s)]
*  we're going to start thinking about what this looks like without America. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=260.0s)]
*  We're going to look for new trade partners. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=264.0s)]
*  We're going to build new alliances. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=266.0s)]
*  Given that that is the mandate he is coming in with, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=268.0s)]
*  what is that likely to look like in the next few weeks and months? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=272.0s)]
*  Right. Well, we heard Mark Carney look at, made this part of his campaign, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=276.0s)]
*  a former central banker, former governor of the Bank of England. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=281.0s)]
*  He's already talking about strengthening ties with Europe, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=284.0s)]
*  where he has a tremendous network there. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=287.0s)]
*  He's also looking at skepticism, saying on the campaign trail that, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=291.0s)]
*  you know, this relationship that Canada has with the U.S. is over. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=294.0s)]
*  And we're seeing this reflected with this stunning moment of national unity [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=297.0s)]
*  by Canadians against the administration and the United States. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=301.0s)]
*  We see this illustrated by liquor stores removing American whiskey, American wine. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=305.0s)]
*  We're seeing Canadians cancel their vacations to New York, to Vegas, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=311.0s)]
*  to Florida, to California, and really pulling together this country, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=314.0s)]
*  united against this president. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=318.0s)]
*  And this is perhaps the most Canadian of examples. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=321.0s)]
*  Canadians are booing the Americans at hockey games. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=324.0s)]
*  Canadians are normally very polite, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=326.0s)]
*  but this really cut deep with the Canadian public. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=328.0s)]
*  So when Mark Carney identified that who's best to stand up to Trump, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=331.0s)]
*  that reversed his party's dismal showing in the polls, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=336.0s)]
*  vaulting him to lead the party to square off against President Trump. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=340.0s)]
*  As you noted off the top, the two will meet face to face. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=345.0s)]
*  If not before June, they will meet face to face on Canadian soil [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=347.0s)]
*  when Canada hosts the G7. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=351.0s)]
*  So it will be interesting, and it will also be a major test for Mark Carney, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=353.0s)]
*  who's led, who's been a technocrat leading central banks, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=356.0s)]
*  but this is the first time he's leading a nation [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=359.0s)]
*  and clearly captured the emotion from the Canadian public on election night. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=361.0s)]
*  I have to take us to break, but real quick, I do want to read this quote [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=365.0s)]
*  from Republican Congressman Don Bacon of Nebraska, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=368.0s)]
*  who told Politico's Jonathan Martin, quote, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=372.0s)]
*  The Liberals in Canada were losing big until our president kept mocking Canadians, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=374.0s)]
*  our neighbors and close friends. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=378.0s)]
*  He made Canadian Liberals great again. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUTMBb0fsvg&t=380.0s)]
