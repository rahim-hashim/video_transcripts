# Wall Street Update: Stocks drop after Trump calls Fed Chair Powell 'a loser'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w)
*  We're back with the breaking news. Take a look at the Dow. Down about 3% right now, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=0.0s)]
*  almost 1200 points. Markets falling after President Trump once again criticized the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=5.88s)]
*  Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, calling him a loser. NBC's Brian Chung is here following [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=11.16s)]
*  this for us. What's happening here? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=17.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, we can see the Dow Jones down on the screen ahead of you, down over 3%. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=18.96s)]
*  By the way, I want to point out over the last month, the Dow Jones is down 9.6%. So it has [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  not been pretty for anyone that's been checking their portfolios, but it seems like the market [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=26.72s)]
*  action today is really hinged to those remarks that we heard from the president via Truth [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=30.36s)]
*  Social this morning, where he again doubled down this rhetoric that he's been harping [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=33.96s)]
*  on over the last week of being disappointed with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=37.92s)]
*  action on federal reserve interest rates, or maybe lack thereof, because the Fed hasn't [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=41.92s)]
*  done anything, hasn't changed interest rates in their last few meetings. But the president [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=47.2s)]
*  urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, describing Mr. Powell as quote, Mr. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=52.28s)]
*  too late, saying he's a major loser. He said Powell has always been too late spelling the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=57.04s)]
*  word too wrong. But I want to point out here that the Fed Chairman, Jerome Powell, who, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=62.44s)]
*  by the way, was put into that position by President Trump during his first term is used [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=66.72s)]
*  to this type of bashing publicly. We have to remember even during the 2018-2019 trade [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=71.72s)]
*  war with China that the president was waging during his first term, he described Jerome [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=76.6s)]
*  Powell as having no touch. He can't putt. He described in 2019 that Jerome Powell was [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=80.72s)]
*  quote, like a stubborn child. So I know that when people see these headlines and say, well, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=85.4s)]
*  this is a big deal that the president is calling his own Fed chair a loser. But Jerome Powell [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=89.48s)]
*  is pretty used to this. I think the question here is, does the Fed get tilted at some point [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=94.24s)]
*  into having to lower interest rates? That did happen in 2018-2019 when financial markets [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=98.52s)]
*  were out of control, as well as the concerns about the economy. It's substantially deteriorating [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=103.56s)]
*  as a result of these tariffs. I mean, this is all kind of deja vu, Chris, and you do [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=108.64s)]
*  wonder whether or not a similar situation is going to play out here. But clearly, investors [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=111.6s)]
*  pretty rattled by it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=115.36s)]
*  Well, yeah, the fact that it is not anything new for him to attack Jerome Powell. It is [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=116.36s)]
*  years. But even recently, in recent weeks, he seems to be every couple of days has something [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=121.6s)]
*  negative to say about Jerome Powell. Why such a negative reaction in the markets? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=126.72s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think it's because you already have the uncertainty of the tariff policy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=130.68s)]
*  We've been talking over the past few weeks that if you're a small business, if you're [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=134.28s)]
*  just a household trying to budget out for the next few months, it is really unclear [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=137.16s)]
*  the impact of these tariffs. So you're going to be very hunkering down. You might be putting [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  more money into your savings. That could lead to a contraction in economic activity. Compile [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=144.72s)]
*  on top of that the concerns over the steward of the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve Chairman, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=149.04s)]
*  who as the head of the central bank, levers interest rates to try to steer the economy [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=154.24s)]
*  clear of a recession. If you don't know if that person is going to be in that job in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=158.2s)]
*  the next few months, that is definitely something that just introduces another layer of uncertainty. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=161.92s)]
*  Although I should point out there's legal ambiguity over whether or not the president [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=166.36s)]
*  has the authority to fire Jerome Powell. The president did post on Truth Social last week [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=169.28s)]
*  that his termination can't come soon enough, referring to the Fed chairman. His term ends [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  May of next year, but maybe there's this concern that he could try to boot him and spur that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  legal challenge earlier than that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=183.3s)]
*  Brian Chung, thank you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJ2Xx43j7w&t=184.64000000000001s)]
