# A crypto dinner and Qatari jet: Do Americans care about Trump’s dealings?
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0)
*  New questions after President Trump's dinner this week with more than 200 investors who [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=0.0s)]
*  bought huge sums worth of his meme coin. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=5.28s)]
*  The AdWords participants spent $1.8 million. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=8.16s)]
*  Trump spoke briefly, but some attendees left disappointed, saying he didn't meet with people [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=11.64s)]
*  or take pictures as had been promised. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=15.88s)]
*  Protesters gathered before the event, and Senator Chris Murphy slammed the dinner in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=19.12s)]
*  a press conference while the White House defended it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=22.38s)]
*  This is the most corrupt White House in the history of the country. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=27.36s)]
*  Just because the corruption is playing out in public where everybody can see it doesn't [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=32.64s)]
*  mean that it isn't rampant, rapacious corruption. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=36.06s)]
*  The president is attending it in his personal time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  It is not a White House dinner. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=44.08s)]
*  It's not taking place here at the White House. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  You mentioned this is not a White House dinner, but the president is always the president, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=47.2s)]
*  and the Trump family is making money off of this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=51.04s)]
*  So can you just explain how is this not the president using the office to enrich himself? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=53.2s)]
*  All of the president's assets are in a blind trust which is managed by his children. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=57.88s)]
*  Well joining me now, former Republican Congressman Denver Riggleman. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=62.96s)]
*  He is also a former Air Force officer and contractor with the National Security Agency [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=66.0s)]
*  and a good friend to us. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=70.88s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=72.08s)]
*  So this guest list for the dinner, it was shrouded in secrecy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=73.08s)]
*  The list of top attendees, it was account usernames, not actual names. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=76.72s)]
*  We do know the top investor identified himself as Chinese-born Justin Sun, who was sued by [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=81.64s)]
*  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=86.66s)]
*  That happened in 2023, alleging fraud. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=89.4s)]
*  That case is still pending. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=93.2s)]
*  So on top of ethical concerns of Trump enriching himself, are there legit security concerns too? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=94.82s)]
*  Well, of course there is. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=101.04s)]
*  I mean, people were wearing masks going into the meeting, Alex. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=103.4s)]
*  I mean, it's just incredible, right, that the corruption does play out in this grand [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=108.04s)]
*  scale, but you know what bothers me? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=111.12s)]
*  You know, I hear, you know, you have senators and congressional representatives talking [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  about how corrupt it is, but I don't think, a lot of the American people don't think it [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=117.0s)]
*  really affects them, so I don't think they really care. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=121.08s)]
*  And while we're appalled at what's happening, it's incredible because I know a little bit [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=123.72s)]
*  about crypto, as you know. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=127.12s)]
*  Alex, I sit on the Financial Services Committee. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=128.12s)]
*  I've done a lot of follow-up money and financial crimes investigations in my former company. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=130.56s)]
*  I find it incredible that you could have foreign nationals that are utilizing Trump [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=135.52s)]
*  as a gateway to the US system to mine citizens. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=141.0s)]
*  And I'm sort of using that as a pun, as you know, with Bitcoin mining, but to mine citizens, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=144.0s)]
*  right? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  It's just incredible to me. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  Of course there are security concerns, but I think the bigger concern is that we have [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=151.18s)]
*  corruption that's so blatant that the very countries that he used to castigate, you know, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  the castigate is, you know, SH it whole countries, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=159.68s)]
*  I mean, what are we? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=163.56s)]
*  I mean, everybody who looks around on the globe now, I think from Eastern Europe to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=164.6s)]
*  Africa to South America to Western Europe, everybody's saying, well, my goodness, US [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=169.08s)]
*  is just a pay to play massive economy, maybe the largest banana republic to ever exist [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=173.4s)]
*  on the planet. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=178.36s)]
*  And I'm wondering if we should start Caligula Coin, because you're talking about the corruption [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=179.7s)]
*  and the grossness that's going on in America. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=183.28s)]
*  You know, I think maybe I'll start that, Alex. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=185.68s)]
*  I'll start Caligula Coin to see if I can make a little bit of money, you know, on this crypto [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=187.28s)]
*  scam we got going on here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=191.32s)]
*  OK, my friend, let me know how that goes. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  So meantime, we have the Trump administration reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=194.84s)]
*  for some migrants. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=200.12s)]
*  Of course, the key legal principle in our constitution preventing people from being [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=201.12s)]
*  unlawfully detained. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=205.24s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was asked to define habeas corpus in a Senate [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  hearing and, well, listen to her answer. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=211.44s)]
*  Secretary Noem, what is habeas corpus? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=214.36s)]
*  Well, habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  people from this country and suspend their right to suspend their rights. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  Let me stop you, ma'am. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=227.28s)]
*  Habeas corpus, excuse me. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=228.28s)]
*  That's incorrect. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=230.48s)]
*  Do you know what section of the Constitution, the suspension clause of habeas corpus is in? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=231.48s)]
*  I do not. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=235.64s)]
*  No. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=236.64s)]
*  Do you know which article it is in? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=237.64s)]
*  No, I do not, sir. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=238.64s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=240.2s)]
*  Well, it is in Article 1. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=241.2s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  What is your reaction to the Secretary of Homeland Security not knowing the meaning [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  of habeas corpus, seemingly answering to curry favor with one person, Donald Trump? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, do you expect the administration will try to suspend habeas corpus? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  And just give me your reaction to Kristi Noem there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  That's a lot to wrap up. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=264.56s)]
*  You know, I can't imagine. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  You're the head of DHS. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=269.96s)]
*  You don't know what habeas corpus means. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=270.96s)]
*  You have no idea. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=273.68s)]
*  You made it up on the spot that somehow there's some constitutional clause where the president [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=274.68s)]
*  can remove people, you know, could detain people. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=279.48s)]
*  And it's so insane even to make if you're going to make something up, even make up something [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=282.36s)]
*  that's a little plausible, not something that seems to come out of a Looney Tunes book. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=287.08s)]
*  And when you're talking about, you know, Kristi Noem as that secretary and what's going on [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=291.48s)]
*  in America right now, are we going to suspend habeas corpus? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=295.24s)]
*  I think what you're saying, I do believe if they keep trying to find, you know, this immigration [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=298.68s)]
*  disaster, as they call it, as an invasion, they might. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=305.72s)]
*  But you know, my biggest worry is the Insurrection Act. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=309.16s)]
*  My biggest worry is that people are going to get so fed up. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=311.24s)]
*  There is going to be violence or there's just even going to be peaceful protests and there's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=313.24s)]
*  going to be an overreaction with the Insurrection Act. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=317.0s)]
*  I think that's first. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=318.96s)]
*  I think, you know, the suspension of habeas corpus have to ever happen. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=319.96s)]
*  You know, I think maybe it's a 20% chance, but I think the Insurrection Act is probably [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  much more of a probability, which then could lead to something much worse down the line. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=327.16s)]
*  Oof. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=330.88000000000005s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=331.88000000000005s)]
*  That's frightening to contemplate. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=332.88000000000005s)]
*  Let me ask about the U.S. formally accepting the 747 jet gifted to Trump by Qatar. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  But this one requires extensive retrofitting, if you're going to use it as Air Force One. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  And the New York Times reports it could cost a billion dollars or more and take at least [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  two years. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=349.68s)]
*  Senator Tammy Duckworth said she worries there will be pressure to cut corners to get that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=351.04s)]
*  plane ready sooner, which then could compromise national security. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=355.96s)]
*  Does that worry you, Denver? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=360.08s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=361.76s)]
*  I mean, but you know what I think is going to happen, Alex? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=362.76s)]
*  I don't think it will ever get in. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=365.4s)]
*  I don't think it will ever be used as Air Force One. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=367.0s)]
*  I think eventually it will just be used as Trump's private jet when he leaves office. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  I think they're going to keep having more and more delays going forward. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=372.79999999999995s)]
*  Is he going to pay for the gas? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=375.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, no, of course not. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=377.35999999999996s)]
*  You know, I think, you know, that's the thing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=379.64s)]
*  He might have to pay for the gas when he gets out. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=382.66s)]
*  But again, with Secret Service, how are they going to fund it afterwards? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=384.42s)]
*  So if he has his own jet after he gets out, and these are just some questions, Alex, I'm [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=387.78000000000003s)]
*  just asking questions, right? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=390.82000000000005s)]
*  If they have Secret Service on that jet after he leaves the presidency, who's paying for [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POLNhzGQ8K0&t=393.18s)]
