# 'A stain on the admin.' Far-right Laura Loomer slams Trump's reported Qatari plane gift
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE)
*  Trump is about to accept quite possibly the largest foreign gift ever received by the United States government. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=0.0s)]
*  And it comes courtesy of Qatar, where the royal family is set to gift the president a super luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=7.0s)]
*  Trump will reportedly use the plane as a new version of Air Force One until he leaves office in January 2029, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=16.5s)]
*  when ownership will be transferred to the foundation overseeing his yet-to-be-built presidential library. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=23.0s)]
*  The gift is expected to be announced when Trump visits Qatar as part of his trip to the Middle East, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=28.5s)]
*  his first major foreign trip, which he's scheduled to leave for tomorrow. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=33.5s)]
*  Moments ago, the White House responded that any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=37.5s)]
*  President Trump's administration is committed to full transparency. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=46.5s)]
*  The Qatari government put out their own statement disputing the reporting, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=50.5s)]
*  saying the matter is still under review and that a decision has not yet been made. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=54.5s)]
*  There are already some chuckles at this table. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=58.5s)]
*  They're trying to manifest it into existence. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=60.5s)]
*  Okay. Jeremy, what do you make of what's being called this like floating palace in the sky? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=62.5s)]
*  Well, I think this is a classic example of the way that Trump has completely blurred the lines between public responsibility and the presidency and his personal private gain. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=69.5s)]
*  And you've seen this time and time again, whether it is having events, official events at his golf course, to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, I believe, in some cases. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=80.5s)]
*  You know, you see it all even in his keeping of certain documents, right? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=89.5s)]
*  Like, remember, the whole raid at Mar-a-Lago was because he kept government documents. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=96.5s)]
*  They belong to the government, not to a president. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=102.5s)]
*  And he refused to give those up because he treats the whole presidency as if it is his office and not the American people. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=105.5s)]
*  So why wouldn't he then assume that the presidential jet belongs to him and not the American people? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=113.5s)]
*  So it sounds like if this goes through, which, you know, there's some open questions there that he's going to hang on to this after his presidency. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=121.5s)]
*  And I mean, I hate to say it, but I wasn't really surprised. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=128.5s)]
*  I'm kind of surprised that there hasn't been more of an effort to explain this in a way that's from the White House, other than this hypothetical statement of, oh, these gifts are always accepted. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=133.5s)]
*  Everything is above board. Just trust us. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=145.5s)]
*  This is my question. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=146.5s)]
*  I know it's kind of naive at this point to ask, is this legal? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=147.5s)]
*  But is this legal? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=151.5s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=153.5s)]
*  We need congressional approval. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=154.5s)]
*  We have an emoluments clause. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=155.5s)]
*  If I try to take out a civil servant to lunch, you know, I think they can't accept more than $20 or $25. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=157.5s)]
*  Some de minimis thing like how is it that a president can accept a $440? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=165.5s)]
*  Well, that's what I mean. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=169.5s)]
*  Anyone who's worked for government, which I have at multiple levels, you know, a $25, $50 lunch is something that you've got to be able to explain to somebody. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=170.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=179.5s)]
*  So the fact that the president is getting a tricked out plane from another country and to your point, he's going to take it with him once he's left the White House. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=180.5s)]
*  That means that has nothing to do with the American people. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=190.5s)]
*  This is really just about him. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=192.5s)]
*  And I think about this, you know, people talk about prosperity gospel. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=195.5s)]
*  This is like prosperity politics, right? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=199.5s)]
*  That as long as he's doing well and the body sees him doing well, then the body is going to be good. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=202.5s)]
*  And that's just not the way it works. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=208.5s)]
*  That sort of trickle down sort of wealth that does not that's never happened in the history of our country. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=209.5s)]
*  And so you get the sense that, well, this is really just about him. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=216.5s)]
*  And this is why I think it's so important for Democrats to just constantly keep keep putting their, you know, paying attention to this and pointing this out. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=220.5s)]
*  He's going to keep doing this and sort of the accretion of all this wealth and favor. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=229.5s)]
*  But what happens to the ordinary person? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=234.5s)]
*  What happens to the grassroots family on the ground that voted for him because they thought he was going to make their life better? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=237.5s)]
*  I kind of keep coming back to this question about why. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=243.5s)]
*  Why does Donald Trump need to do this? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=246.5s)]
*  Right. I take away the foreign governments. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=247.5s)]
*  Foreign governments are always going to try to find ways to have influence with American politicians for whatever interests they may have. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=250.5s)]
*  But I come back to why the United States is president feels that he needs to accept a gift of this magnitude if he is going to accept it from a foreign government. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=258.5s)]
*  A government that just I'd probably say nine years ago, he was out there at the White House supporting a blockade against in 2016 when the Saudis and the Emiratis and others led this blockade against Qatar. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=266.5s)]
*  He supported it. And then and then somebody seems like they got to him and they're like, wait a minute, Mr. President, you do know that we have central command is there. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=278.5s)]
*  We have a huge Air Force presence there. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=286.5s)]
*  We do all of our Middle East operations out of there. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=288.5s)]
*  Might not be a good idea to put him under a blockade or support the blockade. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=290.5s)]
*  So I have zero questions about why Donald Trump is willing to accept these gifts. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=294.5s)]
*  I think he just likes to accumulate stuff and like staff people sucking up to him. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=299.5s)]
*  My bigger question is what do the other countries expect to get an exchange for it? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=303.5s)]
*  Right. Like we have seen that there is the push from the US government to try to get countries to adopt Starlink. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=308.5s)]
*  For example, Elon Musk Starlink Internet satellite service in exchange for reducing tariffs. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=318.5s)]
*  So in that case, I understand what the other countries are hoping to get out of the exchange. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=325.5s)]
*  But for Qatar, for the Saudis, what do you think? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=330.5s)]
*  What do you know? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=334.5s)]
*  They're asking for. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=335.5s)]
*  Here's a fun fact. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=336.5s)]
*  Do you know which international carrier is the first to use Starlink on their planes? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=337.5s)]
*  Qatar Airways. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=342.5s)]
*  They announced that I think not too long ago. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=344.5s)]
*  And I think it's operational on some flights already. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=346.5s)]
*  But I think it's when these countries are looking for their own self-interest, they see, and certainly from that part of the world, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=349.5s)]
*  they see a president who knows how to talk their language. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=357.5s)]
*  And their language is business, transactional deals, your interest, my interest. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=360.5s)]
*  Let's get this thing done. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=365.5s)]
*  So I think you hear that from all of the kind of unofficial statements that we're hearing right now. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=366.5s)]
*  People want access to the United States for technology, whether it's chips, what have you. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=370.5s)]
*  They also want that security umbrella that the United States for a long time has always provided the Gulf region, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=376.5s)]
*  particularly in the face of a threat from Iran. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=382.5s)]
*  Now the U.S. is negotiating with the Iranians. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=384.5s)]
*  So who knows? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=386.5s)]
*  That may be a factor in some of these talks as well. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=387.5s)]
*  Is there not also, though, a serious national security concern here? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=389.5s)]
*  I have to think so. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=393.5s)]
*  Wouldn't you imagine they would be bugging that plane while they're tricking it out right now? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=394.5s)]
*  As you said, right, bugging the plane and as you talk about Starlink and foreign airlines using it, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=398.5s)]
*  I'm like, well, let me turn my, you know, I'm not even going to connect to the Internet while I'm on the plane, right? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=403.5s)]
*  What are you going to do on the plane after 14 hours flying to that part of the world? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=408.5s)]
*  That's a good question, a very good point, because the whole reason Trump is looking at other planes to serve as Air Force One [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=411.5s)]
*  is because the Boeing plane that was supposed to be built for the next president is delayed, right? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=418.5s)]
*  The reason it's delayed, according to Boeing, is because of security concerns. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=424.5s)]
*  They have to have people of a certain security clearance working on that plane or else who knows what could happen? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=428.5s)]
*  What could be compromised? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=433.5s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=434.5s)]
*  And it's not going to go against Boeing's state safety standards. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=435.5s)]
*  I mean, given everything that we've seen happen over the last year. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=438.5s)]
*  They are telling you this needs to be slow rolled. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=441.5s)]
*  I think you should listen. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=444.5s)]
*  I was wondering if he gets a voucher and he just goes to the Boeing headquarters like, hey, I got this gift certificate from the government of Qatar. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=445.5s)]
*  I'm allowed to cash it in for 747. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=450.5s)]
*  But to everyone's point about security, I mean, there is this incredible sort of chart of all of the businesses that Elon has, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=452.5s)]
*  how all of so many of these departments are tied up in his businesses and the ones that Doge has gone into, right? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=459.5s)]
*  So there are these real questions about how much information is he getting? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=467.5s)]
*  Where is that? What is that information being used for? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=470.5s)]
*  So when the White House posts this point about transparency, are they really? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=473.5s)]
*  Because I haven't seen that. I don't understand that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=477.5s)]
*  And there is no transparency and accountability, particularly where it comes to Elon. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=479.5s)]
*  So when you combine that with this plane. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=483.5s)]
*  Well, it's not just Elon Musk. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=486.5s)]
*  No, it's not. It's so much more than that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=488.5s)]
*  Jared Kushner's investment firm took $2 billion from the Saudis. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=490.5s)]
*  Kevin Hassett, who's now one of Trump's top economic advisors, worked for that firm. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=494.5s)]
*  We don't know what kind of back channels they have. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=500.5s)]
*  And again, what favors they're asking for in exchange. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=502.5s)]
*  You know, we've been spending a lot of time talking about like historical trips of the president when they go overseas. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=505.5s)]
*  It's historically been the United States president going to Canada, Mexico, maybe a close U.S. ally like the UK. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=509.5s)]
*  I remember when the president would ever head to the Middle East, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=515.5s)]
*  it would always include include countries like Israel, Egypt and Jordan, who were kind of considered as the security allies of the United States in the region. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=518.5s)]
*  He's not going to any of those three on this first trip to the Middle East like it was back in 2016. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=526.5s)]
*  And then the craziest thing of all this is that Laura Loomer is the one that's calling out the president. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=531.5s)]
*  She put out this tweet. I don't know if you guys saw it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=535.5s)]
*  I don't know if it's a tweet or a post on some social media platform, but she's basically, you know, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=537.5s)]
*  saying this is really going to be such a stain on the administration if this is true, if he's accepting a plane from the government. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=541.5s)]
*  So when Laura Loomer, I can't even imagine this, but you had you said it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=547.5s)]
*  I mean, she's now the moderating voice on this. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=552.5s)]
*  And even a broken clock is correct. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpbrSytAMFE&t=555.5s)]
