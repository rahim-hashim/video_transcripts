# Rep. Ayanna Pressley on the GOP & Trump’s trade war: ‘They have lost the plot’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8)
*  Congresswoman Ayanna Presley of Massachusetts is with us. She sits on the House Financial Services Committee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, so people are like why should we care about Walmart raising the prices? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=7.0s)]
*  And it's my understanding that Walmart is like the bellwether [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=12.0s)]
*  And so if they if their weather in the storm everybody else all the other retailers are going to be okay [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=15.0s)]
*  But if Walmart is sounding the alarm then it is cause for other retailers and therefore the consumers to be concerned [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=20.0s)]
*  Well the bellwether for me is what I hear in community every day from constituents who are weathering the chaos of these reckless tariffs [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=29.0s)]
*  Why are we in a trade war? I mean you know the reduced China tariffs that Trump signaled on Monday that's a respite [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=39.0s)]
*  But it doesn't fix the problem the reason it doesn't fix the problem is because Donald Trump is the problem with his you know temper tantrum tariffs [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=48.0s)]
*  You know that are wreaking havoc for people I have you know my governor and my mayor is that are worried about the impact on state and municipal budgets [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=57.0s)]
*  I have small business owners who are delaying hiring who are worried about supply chain impact who fear that they might have to shutter their doors [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=66.0s)]
*  And moreover working families and parents with young children in particular those essential goods for babies the costs have already skyrocketed [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=76.0s)]
*  I know Donald Trump didn't know what to call it it's a stroller strollers cribs and car seats the cost has skyrocketed [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=86.0s)]
*  And the thing about car seats is like eight out of ten car seats are manufactured in China and that is the only way to safely move with your child to a medical appointment [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=94.0s)]
*  That's a worship to go visit with family not only that it's the law of the land in 50 states and so that's why and then I am on the financial services committee [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=104.0s)]
*  When Secretary of the Senate the Secretary of the Treasury came before us I pressed him look I don't want any of these reckless tariffs [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=112.0s)]
*  But if you are going to proceed forward then we need an exemption at least on these essential goods for babies and he said it is under consideration [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=119.0s)]
*  So I hope that they will will move swiftly on that because people are hurting [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=127.0s)]
*  So you have the trade war going on on one hand and then you have the debate that you're currently having on Capitol Hill you want to call it that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=131.0s)]
*  I know people take issue with that verb over this reconciliation package you have a sense of where the Republicans are right now [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=137.0s)]
*  Well it's a long pause for me [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=143.0s)]
*  That pause was like okay [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=147.0s)]
*  You know look let me just say this they have lost the plot and the plot is the people and because and they know that this that this tax cut for the wealthy [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=150.0s)]
*  Kicking 14 million people off of health care taking food out of the mouths of veterans our seniors our babies that this is unpopular [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=164.0s)]
*  And for people who are hell bent on keeping a job instead of doing it they need to listen to their constituents because they are afraid [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=174.0s)]
*  You know Donald Trump refers to this as the big beautiful bill [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=184.0s)]
*  It's big all right and it is ugly because it is going to make people hungrier it's going to make people poor it's going to make people sicker [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=190.0s)]
*  People will die and the other thing I want to say is that Republicans are running scared so they won't be ten toes down and do town halls and be accountable to constituents [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=198.0s)]
*  And it's gotten so bad that I have constituents that are contacting me because they can't get an audience with their Republican members [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=207.0s)]
*  So during our markup in the financial services committee this was an issue that I pushed on and I elevated the story of a hospice nurse 70 years old Mary from Michigan [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=214.0s)]
*  Who could not get a response from Rep McCaskill she reached out and said look I have an autistic son [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=225.0s)]
*  He cannot be left alone it would be injurious and dangerous he receives Social Security and Medicaid and if these cuts happen it will be a death sentence for our son [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=232.0s)]
*  So I told that story in committee because they don't want to hear what we have to say [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=242.0s)]
*  I mean we can't shame them into action they're not moved by benevolence so at a minimum I hope that they will listen to their constituents and be moved by the understanding that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=247.0s)]
*  They stand to have their seats threatened but moreover it's just the right thing to do so they've lost the plot and we just need four Republicans of conscience [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=257.0s)]
*  And we can stop this and the last thing is we do have a discharge petition to force a vote on this [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=268.0s)]
*  It's called hands off Medicaid and SNAP which will force Republicans to go on the records and so many of them have said they wouldn't support a bill that cuts Medicaid and this would put them on the record [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=272.0s)]
*  You talk about the people and the fact that Republican members are avoiding them and not wanting to connect with them [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=283.0s)]
*  They'll pay attention when they look up and they don't win that seat that they're sitting in next year [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=292.0s)]
*  But before you get to that I thought it was very telling from yesterday's Washington Post the headline regarding the White House maneuvering around easing the China tariffs [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=298.0s)]
*  Noting Trump's pullback reflected the core tension that has bedeviled the White House [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=310.0s)]
*  What he seeks is virtually impossible without substantial political and economic blowback even to the constituencies the administration is aiming to protect meaning that his own people are getting hurt [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=315.0s)]
*  So you're looking at these communities because a lot of the thinking in Maga Land that all this stuff is only going to impact those blue counties those blue cities those blue states [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=327.0s)]
*  And they failed to understand and appreciate something you know very well that the rate of return right on the taxes that are spent out in a crazy way is covered and protects more of those red states and takes care more of those red states [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=337.0s)]
*  So all of this going after and breaking down these communities is really coming home [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=358.0s)]
*  But guess what he's going to do is a very predictable Trump play which is he is an arsonist and then he plays firefighter [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=366.0s)]
*  And so that is the proposal and the reflexive pullback but the point is people are really hurting and they're bracing for the impact of more harm if this bill becomes law [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=373.0s)]
*  And so we have to do everything in our power to ensure that this partisan Republican bill does not become law [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=385.0s)]
*  People are hurting so you've got the current economic situation you've got this bill that is literally going to strip health care away from folks you've got the tariffs that are just at any given Sunday they change [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=391.0s)]
*  And on top of all of that the government now says hey everybody needs to start paying back their student loans and if you don't pay we're just not going to pop you in forbearance we're going to garnish your wages [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=403.0s)]
*  We're going to take your money by any means necessary and so you Senator Booker and Senator Warren actually unveiled a bill to suspend those wage garnishments [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=414.0s)]
*  And I wonder do you have bipartisan support for that because again just like we're talking about with the tariff situation this does not say oh we're only going to garnish the wages of people that voted for Democrats [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=425.0s)]
*  Well we just introduced the bill so we're building support for that now and again it is a transcendent issue and you know when families are already struggling to make every dollar stretch [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=440.0s)]
*  They're already coming for your health care or they're coming for food for our most vulnerable you layer that with the impact of these reckless tariffs [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=450.0s)]
*  And then a lot of people don't even know that they are out of forbearance and that they have gone into default [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=460.0s)]
*  There are some five million defaulted borrowers right now that are at risk for an offset with their tax refund being seized social security being seized [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=467.0s)]
*  People don't consider social security but that is the fastest growing constituency of borrowers are 50 plus so you're talking about folks who have constituents that are 82 years old still paying on this debt [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=477.0s)]
*  And they're heading into being on fixed incomes and now that's being threatened right and then wage garnishment and so we've introduced myself as Senator Booker Senator Warren the ending administrative wage garnishment act [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=489.0s)]
*  To suspend and remove this punitive tool of garnishment it is it is cruel and it has a disparate impact on the most vulnerable borrowers and again so many borrowers are already paying a mortgage before they have a mortgage [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=503.0s)]
*  Given the expense of these of these loans and this is meant to really roll back the gains in the progress that was made on student loan debt and also to dismantle the Department of Education because even though it takes an act of Congress to dismantle the Department of Education [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=518.0s)]
*  They can can gut any road edit they laid off more than 50% of the workforce so borrowers if you have questions about what is your standing it's going to be a struggle for them in this moment because they could be on the phone for days trying to reach a loan service provider and then unable to reach someone at the Department of Education because of those layoffs so that's why we've introduced the ending administrative wage garnishment act [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=534.0s)]
*  Maybe they need to call Fox News it seems like Linda can get over there that's the Education Secretary folks [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJMUDL3Yj8&t=559.0s)]
