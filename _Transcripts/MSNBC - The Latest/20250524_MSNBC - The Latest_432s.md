# Chasten Buttigieg: Children’s book is an opportunity for LGBTQ families to ‘see themselves’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE)
*  In June, Washington, D.C., is playing host to World Pride. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=0.0s)]
*  But it comes as the Trump administration continues to take aim at the LGBTQ-plus community and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=5.16s)]
*  diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=10.52s)]
*  Attacks from the president and his party have created an atmosphere for targeting books [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=13.6s)]
*  on the LGBTQ community. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=17.88s)]
*  A PEN America report found that, of the books that were banned last school year, half featured [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=19.84s)]
*  LGBTQ-plus characters or people of color. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=26.32s)]
*  Despite the national erasure of these stories, Chastain Buttigieg just released his new children's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=30.04s)]
*  book, Papa's Coming Home, which features a family with two dads. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=34.4s)]
*  Joining us now to discuss is Chastain Buttigieg, author of Papa's Coming Home and husband [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=39.0s)]
*  of former U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Chastain, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=47.08s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=49.96s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=50.96s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=51.96s)]
*  The book, cute, sweet, short, because it's a kid's book, the thing that you said when [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=53.12s)]
*  writing this is that you wanted to have your children have a story about a family that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=58.86s)]
*  looked like theirs, that there was no pain, there was no discomfort. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=64.72s)]
*  They just were like existing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=68.56s)]
*  Talk a little bit about why that's important in this moment. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=70.44s)]
*  Yeah, I really wanted to just have a regular day in the life story with a family that looked [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=73.6s)]
*  like ours. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=78.68s)]
*  Books are windows and mirrors, right? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=80.14s)]
*  An opportunity to either see ourselves reflected in the book or an opportunity to learn something [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=81.62s)]
*  new about somebody else or peer into a different world. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=85.86s)]
*  So for my kids, for my family, this is an opportunity just to see themselves in the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=88.7s)]
*  book. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=93.06s)]
*  And for every other family, it's an opportunity to see that families take lots of different [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=94.1s)]
*  structures. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=98.42s)]
*  But really, at the end of the day, this was a book about unconditional love. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=99.42s)]
*  It's a dad coming home from the airport and thanking his kids for bringing all this stuff, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=102.94s)]
*  but saying the best part about coming home is you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=107.26s)]
*  It's not all the material things in the house. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=109.7s)]
*  It's the love that we share in this house. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=112.22s)]
*  And that's the best part about coming home. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=114.04s)]
*  Go ahead, Elise. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  Okay, sorry. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  I wasn't sure he was going to jump. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  So you've said you're not ready to comment if your husband is going to run in 2028. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=122.58s)]
*  But what do you think about the atmosphere surrounding a gay candidate entering the race [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=130.06s)]
*  and the possibility of a second gentleman? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=136.58s)]
*  Do you think that, well, it's a gay second gentleman, granted, because we've already [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=139.02s)]
*  had Doug. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=142.62s)]
*  But do you think that the environment has changed since the last run that he attempted [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=143.62s)]
*  and is more welcoming? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=148.46s)]
*  Or do you think that perhaps it's just as hard as it always has been? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=150.06s)]
*  That was a big switch from Eugene's question. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=155.3s)]
*  We do a lot on the weekend. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=158.02s)]
*  We do a lot on the weekend, honey. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=161.18s)]
*  It's my book, and then you know, got to just ask. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=162.18s)]
*  Look, I think one of the most important things that I would want to say to the country and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=165.89999999999998s)]
*  especially to our community right now is I know it feels like the country is backsliding. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=169.38s)]
*  And in some ways it is, right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=174.38s)]
*  We see in some of these states, MAGA-aligned Republicans attacking the LGBTQ community. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=175.61999999999998s)]
*  But the thing that I really want to speak about is how I believe that this country is [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=181.14s)]
*  full of good people. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=185.73999999999998s)]
*  I'm on book tour right now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=187.22s)]
*  I travel the country a lot. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=189.26s)]
*  I meet with teachers and librarians and parents and community members. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=190.7s)]
*  And this country is full of good people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=194.34s)]
*  And I don't want us to think that folks in Washington are the loudest people on social [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=197.7s)]
*  media define who we are as a country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=204.66s)]
*  I see folks in Washington who are, I guess, technically members of Congress, but really [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=207.98s)]
*  what they are is influencers. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=212.74s)]
*  And they're giving people, you know, a license to be the worst types of themselves. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=214.54s)]
*  So I hope as we head into Pride Month that folks in our community recognize that, one, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=220.1s)]
*  it takes all of us coming together to take care of each other. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=226.7s)]
*  And two, it's a season of active allyship. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=229.26s)]
*  And I want people to think about that word. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=231.94s)]
*  And have they given themselves that title or have they earned it? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=233.9s)]
*  That's what I'm focused on right now is showing up for people, making sure that they know [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=236.9s)]
*  there are a lot of us out here fighting for them, and then calling people in positions [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=241.02s)]
*  of power to task for when they make decisions that harm especially the most vulnerable [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=245.02s)]
*  people in our community, especially young people. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=251.94s)]
*  Chasted, when you and I sat down for my podcast at the Washington Post, what was that? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=255.34s)]
*  2019, 2020? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=259.74s)]
*  You were talking, your book was out then. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=262.82s)]
*  Your first book was out then. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=265.38s)]
*  And we talked about what you were hearing from LGBTQ folks as you traveled the country [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=267.22s)]
*  and how that made you feel. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=274.06s)]
*  Now, you're back on Book Tour again. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=275.5s)]
*  I'm wondering if you have seen how much the dialogue has changed in those intervening years. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=278.38s)]
*  Are people more scared or are they maybe oddly more hopeful despite what's happening in the country? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=285.34s)]
*  I think people are a little frightened for sure. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  But the thing that I want to remind them of is that Twitter and Instagram does not define our country, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=299.1s)]
*  that sometimes there are the worst types of people spending all day online, or remember that you [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=306.06s)]
*  might be arguing with a robot, designed to make you believe that our country is backsliding and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=312.70000000000005s)]
*  our country is at its worst. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=319.02000000000004s)]
*  I think people are right to maybe be concerned about some of this legislation that we see being [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=320.70000000000005s)]
*  introduced and passed that is targeting the LGBTQ community. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=326.06s)]
*  But I also see the best of America when I'm on the road. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=329.98s)]
*  I see teachers showing up for their kids, librarians who aren't throwing their hands up and walking [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=333.5s)]
*  out the door, although I think we can all understand why anyone in the field of education [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=338.38s)]
*  would want to say enough. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=342.62s)]
*  But that's not who educators are. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=343.98s)]
*  They fight for our kids. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=345.9s)]
*  And they're some of the most inspiring people in our country, folks who are just going to work [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=347.02s)]
*  every day trying to show up for their families and do a good job. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=352.3s)]
*  And I think the more we spend offline, the more time we spend offline in our community taking care [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=355.42s)]
*  of people around us, the better we'll feel about the bigger work that awaits us when we're looking [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=360.3s)]
*  at things in Washington. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=365.58000000000004s)]
*  I want to remind people that we have a lot of power. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=366.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, Elon Musk is sitting back in wherever he lives now, right, with a lot of buyer's remorse, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=368.86s)]
*  because people kept raising their voices and saying enough, this isn't who we are as a country. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=373.34000000000003s)]
*  Chas, it sounds like you're ready to hit the campaign trail. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=378.7s)]
*  I was thinking the same thing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=383.98s)]
*  We may have a Congressman Chas to coming up here. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=385.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=388.06s)]
*  No, I'm just a dad. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=388.62s)]
*  I'm a dad who's a little ticked off at the state of the country. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=390.7s)]
*  And I really, really care about my kids as a former teacher. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=393.98s)]
*  I think about what a lot of teachers are going through. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=396.62s)]
*  I'm very grateful to have this platform to get to talk to people around the country. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=398.94s)]
*  But I think it's going to take a lot more dads and teachers and community members speaking up [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=402.38s)]
*  in this type of moment. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=407.34s)]
*  Chas and Buddha Judge, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LczwN5i4BE&t=409.5s)]
