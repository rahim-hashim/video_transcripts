In an emotional moment, Booker also met a constituent, Catherine Baker — a former USAID contractor who was forced out by President Trump and Elon Musk. Booker read Baker's emotional letter during his history-making marathon Senate speech. Baker told Booker: "For me, it means the world to have my voice elevated."

**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY)
*  We have to be able to make our government better, more efficient, more effective. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=0.0s)]
*  But the way they're going about it, to me, is not just grift and a scam, because they're [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=5.14s)]
*  rising government spending, hurting the services Americans receive, creating more deficit, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=9.84s)]
*  and protecting billionaires, not to mention allowing Elon Musk to have access to our most [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=15.82s)]
*  private information that they're scraping. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=20.04s)]
*  Oh, we're going to talk about that. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=22.12s)]
*  But the biggest thing I want to tell you is what they are messing up big in a way that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=23.68s)]
*  should anger every American is we are losing services, from veterans services to health [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=29.18s)]
*  care services to school lunch services. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=36.74s)]
*  We are losing services. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=39.78s)]
*  And the people who are billionaires and millionaires right now, or people like Elon Musk, are getting [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=41.78s)]
*  the tax break. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=46.739999999999995s)]
*  And by eviscerating people like inspector generals, we are losing the most important [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=48.58s)]
*  thing in government, which is accountability. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=55.04s)]
*  We're talking to an inspector general. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=57.2s)]
*  Next, quickly to our audience, when the president won the election, show of hands, did you think [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=58.74s)]
*  he would lose your job? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=63.660000000000004s)]
*  Yes? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=64.66s)]
*  But a lot of folks didn't. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=65.66s)]
*  I want to actually play a bit of that 25-hour and five-minute speech you gave on the Senate [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=69.98s)]
*  floor. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=76.14s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=77.14s)]
*  This has ruined me. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=79.5s)]
*  My mortgage payment isn't what makes me cry, though. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  It's our local staff and partners that come to mind every night as I say my prayers. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=85.14s)]
*  When I close my eyes, the specter of very real people from my travels and projects appear, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=90.66s)]
*  and I hear the echoes of suffering they shared with me, suffering they were able, they were [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=97.7s)]
*  sure to note was alleviated, however temporally, by the United States of America through USAID. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=103.58s)]
*  That was a letter you received from Kathryn Baker from Netsu, New Jersey. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=114.02s)]
*  Senator Booker, Kathryn Baker. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=118.86s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=119.86s)]
*  Your letter blew me away. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=120.86s)]
*  Your heart and your compassion. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=121.86s)]
*  While you were going through so much for you to show your care for the work you were all [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=122.86s)]
*  doing, you were an extraordinary American. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=134.34s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=135.34s)]
*  I'm used to the world. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=136.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=137.34s)]
*  Don't go anywhere, Senator. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=138.34s)]
*  This is the first time that the two of you have met. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=139.66s)]
*  I am blown away. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=142.1s)]
*  So am I. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=143.1s)]
*  What is it like for you to meet Senator Booker, know that he read your letter into the record [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=144.1s)]
*  there on the floor of the Senate? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=148.82s)]
*  I was shocked when it was happening. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=150.7s)]
*  I never thought, and this is just key for everyone to know, do write your representatives [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  because maybe they don't read it themselves right away, but their amazing staff does. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  For me, it means the world to have my voice elevated, but also you have no idea the amount [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=163.3s)]
*  of people that have contacted me, some of my colleagues here in the audience, my dear [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=168.1s)]
*  friend Julia Hurley, whose letter you read right before mine. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=171.9s)]
*  These people reached out to me and they said, for the first time, I was able to show my [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=175.54s)]
*  friends, my family what this work meant. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=179.66s)]
*  My 20-year-old daughter looked at me and said, Dad, I get it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=181.66s)]
*  I get why you're going to miss this job. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=185.45999999999998s)]
*  And so thank you for helping us articulate that, which us in the USAID community have [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=188.78s)]
*  been screaming about since January 24. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=194.45999999999998s)]
*  The thing that broke me as I read your letter, my voice broke, because here you were, I'm [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=196.9s)]
*  not sure how you met your mortgage payment. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=201.46s)]
*  You said you applied for something like 60 jobs, only got two interviews. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=204.02s)]
*  You were clear living, but the thing you said you were most concerned with, and this is [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=207.38000000000002s)]
*  the truth about our workers, the people that are here, our federal workers, they're so [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=210.26000000000002s)]
*  vilified, demeaned and degraded by this president, but so many of them I meet around the country, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  their biggest conviction is not themselves, it's the American people they serve, and you [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=220.18s)]
*  clearly are that kind of person. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=224.02s)]
*  The word suffering, Catherine, came up in your letter, the suffering of other people. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=225.38s)]
*  It wasn't about you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=228.82s)]
*  And I think that that's such a common thread. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=229.82s)]
*  What is it about all of you that that's the common thread? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=231.66s)]
*  You're thinking about the suffering of others. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  I think it's because we are proud Americans, and we know that even though this is a difficult [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=235.54s)]
*  time, we are blessed to live in the country in which we live. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=241.57999999999998s)]
*  And we know that so many of our colleagues, so many of our local partners, our foreign [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=245.62s)]
*  service nationals who serve this country diligently have been treated terribly. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=250.06s)]
*  We know that they are going to go without access to food, to medicine. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=255.9s)]
*  They are going to suffer from conflict, violence. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=259.6s)]
*  And so we feel compelled to speak up for them. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=263.1s)]
*  And I want to recognize all of those foreign service officers and foreign service nationals [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=266.98s)]
*  who serve this country. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=271.34000000000003s)]
*  For 1%, every dollar you send to the federal government, less than 1% would go to the work [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=272.7s)]
*  you're doing. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=277.9s)]
*  And that void now around the world is being filled by the Chinese. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=278.96s)]
*  And I just want to say something. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=282.28s)]
*  This kid, and forgive me for calling you a kid, you're so much younger than me. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=283.56s)]
*  But what is he doing choosing with his life? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=286.64s)]
*  Like the veterans are here. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  He's supposed to do a teacher. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  You didn't choose to teach kids because of the money. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  You didn't choose to be a park service ranger as many federal government not for the money. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  Sam Morris Fletcher, Senator to the US tonight. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=296.76s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=298.76s)]
*  You chose it because you love to serve so many of the people that I meet that are serving [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=300.12s)]
*  our veterans, that are serving our elderly, that are serving young people. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=304.52s)]
*  They want to do it for the love of service, not for their money. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=308.72s)]
*  And for them to be characterized as somehow getting over the American people is so offensive [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=311.12s)]
*  to me. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=315.44000000000005s)]
*  And this to me is a great way of showing what the tragedy is. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=316.68s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Catherine Baker, guys. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=319.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=320.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=321.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE3A1561KY&t=322.48s)]
