**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik)
*  Let's get more now from NBC News senior White House correspondent Gabe Gutierrez, NBC News [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=0.0s)]
*  senior national security correspondent Courtney Kube, and retired Lieutenant General Mark [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=4.48s)]
*  Hurtling, former commander of U.S. Army Europe. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=8.88s)]
*  Courtney, you helped break this story. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=11.88s)]
*  Walk us through the sequence of events and what we now know. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=13.96s)]
*  Yeah, so one of the big questions that we've had ever since the very first signal chat [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=17.2s)]
*  was exposed by the Atlantic several weeks ago was exactly whether this information was [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=21.84s)]
*  classified. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=27.22s)]
*  I don't want to put words in General Hurtling's mouth, but somebody who has been at the tip [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=28.86s)]
*  of the spear during missions and operations can tell you that specific information about [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=32.98s)]
*  an imminent operation, especially one that has already been ordered to go, would be considered [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=39.14s)]
*  classified and oftentimes at some of the highest levels of classification in the United States [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=44.46s)]
*  military. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=48.14s)]
*  And obviously that's to keep the men and women who were involved in that operation safe and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=49.14s)]
*  protect the sanctity of the mission itself. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=52.9s)]
*  Well, what we have now learned is that in fact the information that was provided by [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=55.339999999999996s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth in that signal chat was provided directly from the commander of U.S. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=60.1s)]
*  Central Command, General Eric Carilla. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=66.06s)]
*  And in fact, he sent that information on a classified system to Secretary Hegseth. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=68.94s)]
*  And Ana, what we learned according to these officials who we spoke with was in fact, Secretary [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=73.38s)]
*  Hegseth sent, forwarded on that information on his personal phone, on an unclassified [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=77.5s)]
*  signal app, a messaging app that many people use, frankly, but again, unclassified. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=85.1s)]
*  Literally within minutes of getting that information, he sent that on, on the signal app, not only [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  to the signal chat that National Security Advisor Mike Walz had started, but also on [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=98.18s)]
*  the one that the secretary himself had started that, as we have now learned, included his [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=105.3s)]
*  wife, his brother, his personal attorney, and a number of his top aides. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=109.34s)]
*  Again, the information was provided to Secretary Hegseth on a classified server and he passed [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=114.94s)]
*  some of it on word for word on the signal app, Ana. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=120.5s)]
*  Gabe, we just heard Hegseth's defense, but what's the White House saying about these [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=124.7s)]
*  new details? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=129.02s)]
*  Hi there, Ana. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=130.02s)]
*  Well, the White House hasn't responded specifically to these new details that just came out this [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=131.02s)]
*  morning in Courtney's reporting. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=135.34s)]
*  However, what we have been hearing from the White House repeatedly is that they think [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=136.9s)]
*  this is a non-story. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=141.82000000000002s)]
*  They keep calling it an old story, old news and a hoax, as White House officials have [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=142.82000000000002s)]
*  described it, and President Trump did so yesterday. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  Now, this all comes, Ana, as the White House really tries to move on from this controversy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=152.34s)]
*  The White House officials I've spoken with insist that the president remains, that he's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=157.22s)]
*  still standing by his secretary of defense. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=162.12s)]
*  He said so as much publicly, and right now we have no indication he's backing off of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=165.34s)]
*  any of that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=170.62s)]
*  Now, during his interview this morning, Secretary Hegseth once again seemed to be playing to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=171.62s)]
*  an audience of one. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=176.5s)]
*  He referred to the president as, quote, superhuman, basically comparing what he's going through [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=177.86s)]
*  attacks that he feels that the president has undergone as well. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=184.18s)]
*  So, so far from the White House, this does not appear to be shaking their confidence [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=188.78s)]
*  in the secretary of defense, despite all this controversy, and despite one member of the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=193.84s)]
*  Republican Party, Don Bacon of Nebraska, coming out and really questioning Hegseth's leadership [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=197.9s)]
*  on it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  Courtney, what about the rank and file? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=203.98000000000002s)]
*  Because you have these new details kind of reigniting this signal controversy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=205.82s)]
*  There have been recent leaks, new firings. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=210.38s)]
*  Is there a sense of dysfunction behind the scenes at the Pentagon right now? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=212.58s)]
*  Yeah, another one of the talking points we keep hearing from Secretary Hegseth and many [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=217.26000000000002s)]
*  around him, and even frankly as high up as the president, is that morale remains high [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=221.34s)]
*  in the military. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=225.44s)]
*  The reality is, Ana, I've not seen any actual metrics or stats that prove that to be the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=226.44s)]
*  case. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=232.54000000000002s)]
*  About once or twice every year or so, the military will do these surveys where they'll [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=233.54000000000002s)]
*  talk about things like morale. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=238.74s)]
*  Candidly, if there's one that's existed that specifically is talking about this issue and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=240.78s)]
*  it's testing the morale in the military, it's not something that's been made public. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  One of the things that I keep hearing after the first signal chat, but really specifically [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=249.54000000000002s)]
*  after this most recent one, which again, Secretary Hegseth created this signal himself and he [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=253.58s)]
*  is the one who added the people to it, are people are asking about two things. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=259.58000000000004s)]
*  Number one is accountability. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=264.62s)]
*  The secretary and many people around him have made it very clear that they intend to restore [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=266.1s)]
*  accountability to the military. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=270.66s)]
*  And one of the issues that they frequently bring up is the withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=272.58s)]
*  But another is leadership. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=276.88s)]
*  People in the Pentagon, many in the rank and file who I speak with, are asking about whether [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=278.8s)]
*  this is a real show of leadership here that the secretary of defense, look, he's not denying [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=283.74s)]
*  what has happened here, whether this shows the behavior of a leader by not taking accountability [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=288.76s)]
*  for his actions, Ana. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=293.6s)]
*  Courtney, QB, Gabe Gutierrez, keep digging, guys. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=295.06s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=297.62s)]
*  So, General Hurtling, if details about a strike that you just sent over a secure system were [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=298.62s)]
*  then blasted out on someone's personal phone, what would you expect to happen? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=304.64s)]
*  What would be your immediate concerns? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=308.58s)]
*  Well, I would look for an investigation immediately, Ana, and that's something that I think both [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=310.42s)]
*  the Pentagon and the National Security Council has pushed back on. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=316.02s)]
*  They say they're going to do an investigation and that Mike Waltz, the national security [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=319.06s)]
*  adviser, was going to be the one that really focused on it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=323.66s)]
*  I haven't seen that yet. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=326.78000000000003s)]
*  And there continues to be, as Courtney just said, continued refutes of whatever happened. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=329.06s)]
*  And no, we didn't do anything. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=335.18s)]
*  We didn't have any classified information. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=336.66s)]
*  Ana, I'm telling you, looking at what was on the device, that was sensitive information [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  that affected targeting and a process by the U.S. military. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=345.86s)]
*  And the news that came out this morning of it being transferred from what's called a [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=351.34s)]
*  SIPR computer, more than likely, Secret Internet Protocol router, it's a type of computer that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=356.66s)]
*  every single person that has any kind of access to classified information has on their desk, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=363.3s)]
*  along with a regular computer that has unclassified stuff on it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=370.66s)]
*  On those SIPR computers, there are no access panels. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=374.5s)]
*  So in other words, you can't put a stick into it or you can't copy it onto another computer. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=378.42s)]
*  It's impossible to get into that computer. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  So when you're transferring that kind of information, I can conceive of how it was done. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=386.26s)]
*  Whoever transferred it picked up their cell phone, went to the Signal app, looked at their [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=393.3s)]
*  screen on the SIPR net, and then used just the voice data on the Signals Act and basically [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=398.98s)]
*  say what was on that message, the classified message. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=407.14s)]
*  Does it have a classified stamp on it? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=411.38s)]
*  Confidential, secret, top secret? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=414.34s)]
*  No, it does not. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=416.34s)]
*  When it's on the net, it certainly does because it's part of a secret system. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=417.78000000000003s)]
*  But when it goes on the Signals app, just the transfer by voice or taking a photo and [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=422.18s)]
*  pasting it on the Signals app would really condemn whoever does it of passing classified [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=428.58s)]
*  information. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=437.94s)]
*  The other thing that I'd say is there's all the commentary about who it was passed to [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=438.9s)]
*  and whether it was classified or not. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=444.18s)]
*  I'm going to go back to one important point. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=446.26s)]
*  It was signals. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=448.82s)]
*  It was an unclassified system that you're passing this information on. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=450.41999999999996s)]
*  Everyone in the Pentagon has been told, don't use the Signals app. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=455.3s)]
*  It's unclassified and it can be hacked. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=460.74s)]
*  Anyone that knows the use of computer when they go overseas or when they're communicating [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=464.26s)]
*  knows that there are systems within different governments, the Russian, the Chinese, the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=469.46000000000004s)]
*  Iranians that can certainly hack into these systems. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=473.86s)]
*  We have been told that the Secretary of Defense was warned about sharing any sensitive information [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=476.90000000000003s)]
*  over unclassified systems. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=484.5s)]
*  You talk about this computer that is used to pass secure information. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=486.26s)]
*  Clearly, there are ways to pass information along in real time without having to rely [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=491.14s)]
*  on a Signal app. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=497.22s)]
*  Congressman Don Bacon, we heard Gabe mention, retired Air Force General. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=498.74s)]
*  He's now the first Republican to break ranks on all this. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=502.26s)]
*  He called it unacceptable. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=504.98s)]
*  He says Hegseth is, quote, acting like he's above the law and that it shows an amateur [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=506.42s)]
*  person. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=511.06s)]
*  Are you surprised more veterans in Congress, especially on the GOP side, haven't condemned [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=512.02s)]
*  this? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=516.26s)]
*  I know Representative Bacon, he was a Brigadier General in Iraq when I was there commanding [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=518.02s)]
*  a division. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=522.1s)]
*  He knows what's going on. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=523.14s)]
*  In Iraq, we not only had the Super Net and the Nipper Net, the non-classified, but we [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=525.22s)]
*  also had a NATO secret rack. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=529.54s)]
*  You have three computers on your desk. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=531.38s)]
*  Don Bacon was one of the planners in Baghdad that would see this stuff on a daily basis. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=533.3s)]
*  And he knows more than most what would happen to anyone who leaked this kind of information. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=538.5s)]
*  And coming from the phone of Secretary Hegseth, that was a leak. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=545.22s)]
*  And it's interesting that he's condemning all the leakers within his administration, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=550.02s)]
*  or within the Defense Department, but he's not having that reflect back on himself. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=554.42s)]
*  The word I use, Ana, it's my favorite word. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=559.3s)]
*  It's called sophomoric. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=562.66s)]
*  It comes from the Latin, sophomore, wise, and morose, idiot. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=564.1s)]
*  So you know enough to understand, I'm sorry, you know enough to comprehend what's happening, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=568.66s)]
*  but you really don't understand the implications of it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=574.1s)]
*  And that seems to be what Secretary Hegseth is doing right now. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=576.74s)]
*  And the Wall Street Journal editorial board said something similar, calling it a mess at [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=580.9s)]
*  the Pentagon, writing, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=584.58s)]
*  The staff infighting dismissals, leaks over signal app chats, look to be the self-inflicted [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=585.5400000000001s)]
*  mistakes of a management neophyte. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=590.82s)]
*  You think these are rookie mistakes that Secretary Hegseth maybe could grow into the job after all [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=593.7s)]
*  this? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=598.82s)]
*  Well, yeah, I certainly hope so. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=599.0600000000001s)]
*  If he is kept on board, he has to grow into these things. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=601.3000000000001s)]
*  The Defense Department is huge. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=604.5s)]
*  There's a lot for him to learn. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=606.4200000000001s)]
*  He just needs to open his ears and his eyes to learn it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=607.7s)]
*  But here's the here's the one piece I'd also suggest. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=610.5s)]
*  If General Eric Carilla passed this to him on a on a sipper computer, and then he put it on a [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=613.46s)]
*  signals app, I got to tell you, if I'm General Carilla in the field, I'm going to be very [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=619.46s)]
*  careful with what I pass my boss because I don't trust them anymore to keep these kind of secrets [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=624.66s)]
*  until he shows that kind of trust. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=630.74s)]
*  That's the kind of thing that Courtney was talking about in terms of the morale in the Pentagon. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=633.38s)]
*  They don't know who to trust anymore. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=637.54s)]
*  Lieutenant General Mark Hurtling, good to have you here. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=639.62s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8bToef5Gik&t=641.7s)]
