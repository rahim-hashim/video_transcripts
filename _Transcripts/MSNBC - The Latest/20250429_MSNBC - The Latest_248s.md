# ‘Single biggest cut to Medicaid in American history’: Dem lawmaker slams Trump budget plan
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk)
*  Joining me now, Congressman Brendan Boyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who serves as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=0.0s)]
*  ranking member of the House Budget Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=4.84s)]
*  Welcome back to the show. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=7.62s)]
*  As ranking member, you led the opposition to this bill, but walk through for us why [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=9.48s)]
*  you're so opposed to it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=14.86s)]
*  Well, there are many reasons that would probably last longer than the hour show that you have, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=16.88s)]
*  so I'll give you the main ones. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  First, it is the single biggest cut to Medicaid in American history, used to finance trillions [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=23.8s)]
*  of dollars worth of tax cuts that mostly benefit the top 1% of Americans. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=29.78s)]
*  It also cuts student aid programs, it cuts Head Start, it cuts nutrition assistance programs [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=34.52s)]
*  to the tune of several hundred billion dollars, and on and on we go. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=41.02s)]
*  As I mentioned, all to partially subsidize trillions dollars worth of tax cuts. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=45.92s)]
*  The other way they pay for the tax cuts is by putting it on our nation's credit card, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=51.66s)]
*  so this will spike the national debt another several trillion dollars. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=55.7s)]
*  So there are many, many reasons to oppose this bill, but I'd say those are the main ones. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=59.66s)]
*  So the leader, Hakeem Jeffries, said stopping the bill is a matter of life and death, and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=64.34s)]
*  I think some Democrats, maybe many Democrats, agree with that, but they, the Republicans, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=69.89999999999999s)]
*  control both chambers. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=75.02s)]
*  So I'm curious if the approach, you think, has been settled on by Democrats, as we can [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=76.5s)]
*  remind people, but you well know Chuck Schumer infuriated a lot of folks when he voted with [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=83.14s)]
*  the Republicans to avoid a government shutdown. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=89.46s)]
*  What's the approach this time, Congressman? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=92.3s)]
*  Well, first, I mean, I would be shocked if one Democrat voted for this bill, either in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  the House or the Senate, when the first step of it, and reconciliation can be a very confusing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=99.41999999999999s)]
*  process, when the first step of that passed the House a few weeks ago, not one Democrat [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=104.38s)]
*  voted for it, and I think that that trend will continue. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=109.74s)]
*  So that's number one. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=114.33999999999999s)]
*  Number two, you know, someone once said to Harry Truman, give him hell, and Harry said, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=115.8s)]
*  no, I'm just going to tell the truth, and that's hell to the folks on the other side. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  That's the case here when I'm talking about, for example, the Medicaid cuts. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=125.12s)]
*  It is a fact. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=128.84s)]
*  These will be by far the biggest cuts to Medicaid in American history. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=129.88s)]
*  Can I stop you for just, I just want to stop you for a second because I know that you believe [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=133.8s)]
*  be catastrophic, but Speaker Johnson says actually what they're doing is protecting [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=141.44s)]
*  Medicaid, and I want to play it, and I can get your reaction to it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=147.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=150.84s)]
*  We're not gutting Medicaid. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=151.84s)]
*  We're going to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=154.24s)]
*  We're going to preserve the program, not cut it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=155.98000000000002s)]
*  It's exactly the opposite of what the Democrats are saying. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=158.34s)]
*  So the states will adjust to all these things, and we will make sure that the people who [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=161.24s)]
*  need these benefits and rely upon them are protected. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=165.44s)]
*  They say they're saving it essentially for future generations. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=169.08s)]
*  What say you? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=172.08s)]
*  Yeah, I give my credit for saying that with a straight face. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=173.08s)]
*  It takes a lot of talent to be able to deliver a completely disingenuous line like that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=175.96s)]
*  The reality is, and again, this is in black and white in their bill, an $880 billion cut [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=181.84s)]
*  to Medicaid. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=189.08s)]
*  There are 72 million Americans who rely on Medicaid. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=190.08s)]
*  How are you going to push through the biggest cut in American history to Medicaid and then [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=193.38000000000002s)]
*  say with a straight face, oh, even though we're cutting hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=198.02s)]
*  from the program, no one will feel the impact on that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=202.66s)]
*  The 44% of my constituents who get their health care from Medicaid, somehow they won't feel [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=206.02s)]
*  the impact. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=211.74s)]
*  It's all, quote, waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=212.74s)]
*  The only fraud that's going on is attempting to label cutting Medicaid as going after waste, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=215.98000000000002s)]
*  fraud, and abuse. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=222.26000000000002s)]
*  Congressman Brendan Boyle, always appreciate you taking the time to come on the show. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=223.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJSraLydrk&t=227.66s)]
