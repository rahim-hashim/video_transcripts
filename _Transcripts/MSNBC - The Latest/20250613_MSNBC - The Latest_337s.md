# Israel, Iran conflict roils Middle East and raises questions about Trump leadership
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo)
*  Donald Trump made a lot of big promises on the campaign trail. He was going to end the war in Ukraine on day one and the war in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=0.0s)]
*  He was going to ink a nuclear deal with Iran and defend American trade. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=7.0s)]
*  But we are nearly five months into this administration. Not one of those things has happened. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=11.5s)]
*  But the world doesn't seem to be waiting to see if it ever will. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=16.3s)]
*  Ukraine and Israel are calling their own shots now. Nuclear talks with Iran are in limbo. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=20.0s)]
*  And the U.S. has less than a month to negotiate dozens and dozens of trade deals with countries all over the world. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=25.0s)]
*  Let's face it. Many of those countries aren't taking this very seriously right now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=32.0s)]
*  The nightcap is still here. Let's start, Colonel Jack, with just talking about all the stress, all the tension in the Middle East. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=36.0s)]
*  How does it make you feel that the chief diplomat, the head negotiator, is Steve Witkoff, a real estate developer with no international, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=44.0s)]
*  no politics, no policy experience whatsoever, given the tinderbox that is the Middle East now more than ever? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=53.0s)]
*  You know, it's really kind of interesting. Most people would come to the conclusion that if somebody is in business, he is a priori a good negotiator. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=61.0s)]
*  And we've all been in business arrangements, at least business arrangements, that come to the conclusion that's not necessarily true. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=70.0s)]
*  And furthermore, the last place you would need somebody who is really good at business is in the negotiating room. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=79.0s)]
*  Because at the end of the day, business is just the conclusion of a couple of agreements between people who have decided that the stuff that's on the table is the way they're going to do it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=88.0s)]
*  All they're talking about is a slight difference in the price. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=100.0s)]
*  Just about price. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=103.0s)]
*  Well, we're talking about the price at the end of the day. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=104.0s)]
*  But in the use of the diplomatic instrument of power, which, by the way, needs to be integrated with the other instruments of power, economic and military, they need to be all integrated. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=107.0s)]
*  But in the use of the diplomatic instrument of power, that needs to be accomplished with people who are really good at doing that, not necessarily people who are really good at doing something. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=120.0s)]
*  Just because you're good at doing something doesn't mean that you're good at doing other stuff. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=133.0s)]
*  And this demonstrates that that's the case. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=137.0s)]
*  Steve, a moment ago when you were talking about the markets reaction, you said the bond market, that's U.S. Treasuries, just went up slightly today. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=139.0s)]
*  Isn't that just another example of the world moving on without us? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=147.0s)]
*  Right? Because people, no matter what, always flood to buy bonds. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=151.0s)]
*  The idea was everyone is going to give us the best possible trade deal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=155.0s)]
*  We're the United States of America, and we're seeing more and more evidence that people are figuring out their own game. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=158.0s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=164.0s)]
*  And I think it gets back to what was being talked about earlier, which is this notion of these two impulses within the GOP right now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=165.0s)]
*  One is just very heavily militarist. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=172.0s)]
*  One of the other is this isolationist, America first one. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=174.0s)]
*  And this is not all that profound. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=177.0s)]
*  But I don't think you can lead the world if you decide not to lead. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=180.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=184.0s)]
*  And I think that's where we are. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=185.0s)]
*  I was actually have a discussion with one of these very wealthy men. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=187.0s)]
*  He's talking about the idea of what are the most important changes that are going on? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=191.0s)]
*  To me, the withdrawal from the world of U.S. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=197.0s)]
*  leadership may be the most important development that's going on right now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=202.0s)]
*  Now, President Trump is going to go to the G7 on Monday, and I'm going to be watching that very carefully. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=207.0s)]
*  Both the body language and is the president is the United States out front leading or is it somehow withdrawing? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=214.0s)]
*  And at the same time, it's withdrawing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=223.0s)]
*  It's repulsive, which is to push our allies away and no longer have the ability to call our allies and say, let's do this. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=226.0s)]
*  Let's, for example, all of us defend Israel. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=237.0s)]
*  I am fascinated right now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=241.0s)]
*  Having spent a little bit of time in Russia doing a little bit of stuff covering some of the intelligence agencies. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=242.0s)]
*  I do not know right now if our allies in Europe are very willing to share their sensitive intelligence with us. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=247.0s)]
*  The question will be, can we call them our allies or can we call them our nothings? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=255.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's another power, Colonel, to add to the list, by the way, and it's soft power. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=260.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=264.0s)]
*  It's this idea that our flag is is a point of safety and a point of reliability and consistency and deliverables coming in on time. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=265.0s)]
*  And look, I am not here to say that being the world's policeman is the ideal outcome for America forever. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=275.0s)]
*  I'm not saying that, but I have been to enough of these events where there are I've talked to European politicians about this and the whole notion of like, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=284.0s)]
*  well, there's a nuclear destabilization in the Middle East. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=293.0s)]
*  Sure. There's also there's a real concern from our European allies about do we need to have nuclear programs because we can't count on the United States and their shield and their protection. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=295.0s)]
*  And so it's just a matter of the domino effect of what happens when you can't trust the security card at the door. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=307.0s)]
*  You've got to arm yourself. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=315.0s)]
*  You [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OicKRDULo&t=323.0s)]
