# Nicolle Wallace: 'The U.S. economy is being held hostage... by the whims and delusions of one man'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI)
*  Today it became clear just how much every business, big and small, every bank, every institution [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=0.0s)]
*  in the U.S. economy is being held hostage right now by the whims and delusions of one man. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=6.72s)]
*  Of course, we're talking about Donald Trump. The Federal Reserve today opting to hold interest rates [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=12.64s)]
*  unchanged at its monthly meeting as the impacts of Trump's policies on trade and other issues [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=17.68s)]
*  make themselves felt. The Fed saying that, quote, uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=22.96s)]
*  further and that, quote, the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=29.12s)]
*  As the New York Times reports, quote, it is struggling to do both assess the economic fallout [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=34.96s)]
*  from Mr. Trump's policies and game out how it will set monetary policy in an environment in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=39.92s)]
*  which its goals of maintaining a healthy labor market and keeping inflation low and stable [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=46.0s)]
*  may be in conflict. Quote, officials have grown increasingly worried about how much Trump's policies, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=51.52s)]
*  which also includes slashing spending and deporting immigrants, will sap growth. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=57.68s)]
*  The irony of this, of course, is that Trump has been demanding that the Federal Reserve cut [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=64.56s)]
*  interest rates over and over again, at one point even threatened to fire the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=69.44s)]
*  something no president before him has ever done. But Trump's his own problem, it's his own policies, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=74.32s)]
*  particularly the chaotic on-again-off-again nature of his tariffs that are making it impossible for [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=81.12s)]
*  him to get the rate cuts he so desperately seeks. Businesses lack the clarity they need as well. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=87.44s)]
*  As we have reported on this program, the metrics that show goods and materials moving around the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=93.2s)]
*  world are right now flashing bright red. Wall Street Journal reporting this, quote, scrambling [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=97.6s)]
*  to gauge how President Trump's tariffs are flowing through the global economy. Investors are seeking [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=102.56s)]
*  early signs and data from ports, truckers, and railroads. Companies have paused bookings [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=107.92s)]
*  for containers that ferry everything from scrunchies to batteries across the oceans. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=113.6s)]
*  Ocean carriers have been canceling sailings across the Pacific Ocean to the U.S. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=118.96s)]
*  Almost 30 such of such journeys were canceled for the week ending May 4th. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  At the port of L.A., imports are expected to fall 35 percent this week compared to one year ago. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=129.28s)]
*  Truckers are also bracing for a tough year by pulling back on orders for big rigs. ACT [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=136.24s)]
*  research president Ken Veith said dealer inventory levels in March hit a record 91,600 vehicles [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=142.0s)]
*  as truckers were, quote, flirting with global financial crisis profitability levels, end quote. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=149.92s)]
*  Take that in. Trucking companies facing, quote, global financial crisis profitability levels [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=157.84s)]
*  because of some pandemic or weather or external calamity shock, but because of Donald Trump and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=164.96s)]
*  his administration, because of what they are doing and have done. Trump's tariffs are having [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=172.48s)]
*  all sorts of dangerous impacts on the economy right here, right now. The empty shelves that many [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=177.84s)]
*  warn will affect millions of consumers is the culmination of what has now been weeks of Trump [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=183.12s)]
*  fueled economic chaos and uncertainty. The U.S. economy grappling with Trump's chaos and his [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=188.64s)]
*  administration's rather tone deaf response to consumers and businesses concerns is where we [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  start today. Professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, Justin [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  Wolfers is here. Plus, former Republican Congressman David Jolly joins us. He recently [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=204.48s)]
*  registered as a Democrat. He's considering a run for governor of Florida. Also joining us, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  Flexport CEO and founder Ryan Peterson. Flexport is a leader in global supply chain technology. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=214.8s)]
*  Ryan, I read your op-ed in the Wall Street Journal and it stuck with me all weekend. You write, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=222.08s)]
*  an asteroid is coming to destroy America's businesses. Explain. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=227.36s)]
*  Well, the businesses that buy from China in particular, which is a lot of them, we import [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  over $400 billion worth of merchandise from China every year. And so this 145% duty is really [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=238.72000000000003s)]
*  effectively a trade embargo as Secretary Besson himself said yesterday in L.A. that it was a [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=244.0s)]
*  trade embargo. So we're, you know, you can't do that overnight with almost, yeah, there was [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=250.16s)]
*  some warning. People knew this was happening. But on one month's notice to move a supply chain takes [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  a very long time. And in the meantime, small business especially is just going to get wiped [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  out by that hit. Let me read from your fantastic piece in the Wall Street Journal. You write, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  if they don't change the tariffs, it's going to be an extinction level asteroid wiping out the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=272.48s)]
*  dinosaurs kind of event. Only these aren't dinosaurs. These are dynamic, healthy businesses. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  You know this because the businesses are your customers. It's very obvious they feel helpless [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=283.12s)]
*  that nobody was explaining their point of view. Nobody has their back. Why do they think this is [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=288.0s)]
*  happening? I mean, well, by the way, it shouldn't be a huge surprise. The timeline and the severity [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=294.72s)]
*  of it is pretty severe. But Trump campaigned on this. He told us all that tariff is the most [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  beautiful word in the English language. So none of us should be surprised that he wanted to put in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  tariffs. And they think it's happening. Yeah, because that's the president's agenda. He thinks [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  that we need to re-industrialize. He's got some decent points. I mean, we shouldn't get in an [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=316.32000000000005s)]
*  argument with someone unless we can explain their point of view better than they can. So he, one, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=320.64s)]
*  thinks our deficits are too high and tariffs are a way to pay these down. Two, from a national [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  security standpoint, you need to industrialize. You need to be able to produce goods so that you [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=329.2s)]
*  can switch that to armaments or medicine in a crisis. And three is that there's a lot of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=333.52s)]
*  imbalanced trade. A lot of our trading partners have industrial policies that benefit their [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=339.28s)]
*  manufacturers and that make it difficult for our exporters to reach their market. And so there's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=344.32s)]
*  a few reasons why the president believes this that are pretty valid. It's more of just the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=349.04s)]
*  implementation timeline and severity that makes it so that it's not going to achieve those goals. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=353.36s)]
*  Unfortunately, it's going to actually just cripple American business and lead to recession. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=360.0s)]
*  So is there any lifeline for small businesses in America while those goals, whether you believe [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=365.04s)]
*  they're noble or not, are pursued? No. I mean, right now it's sort of put your business on pause [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=370.56s)]
*  and hope for the best. People are doing very creative things, moving merchandise into bonded [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=378.0s)]
*  warehouses so they don't pay customs duties until the goods leave the warehouse, for example. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  And when they do pay the duty, they'll pay it at the then prevailing rate. So people are kind of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=388.56s)]
*  betting that the duties will come down by the time the goods have to leave the warehouse. So [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  there's things like that. They're shifting production as fast as they can out of China, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=398.8s)]
*  which I guess is part of the president's goals and all this. But at the end of the day, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=403.12s)]
*  there's no real relief except for praying that the administration changes their policy and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=408.4s)]
*  they're meeting with the Chinese on Saturday in Switzerland and hoping that that leads to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=416.32s)]
*  some kind of de-escalation here and gets to a lower duty rate where their business is viable again. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=421.6s)]
*  Justin, this will be the first time they've talked. I think that it's fair to say that [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=427.36s)]
*  the response from China wasn't exactly what the administration anticipated. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=433.6s)]
*  And I think national security folks, I mean, Brian mentioned national security concerns. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=439.44s)]
*  National security folks believe that China will have a much stiffer upper lip than the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=444.8s)]
*  American consumer about a prolonged trade war. So in terms of going into this, I don't think [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=449.92s)]
*  anybody sees the American consumer as having any particular advantages in this. What is your [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=456.4s)]
*  assessment of where we are today and how the administration is navigating this? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=465.04s)]
*  I think the administration has totally messed this up. It's kind of stunning that we're in [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=470.24s)]
*  early May right now. They came to power on January 20th and the president is yet, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=475.84s)]
*  yet to talk to President Xi. And I'm pretty sure it's the problem here is not that President Xi [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=481.36s)]
*  doesn't own a phone. It's that President Trump will not call. So this is sort of like, you know, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=486.08s)]
*  look, I had a thing when I was 14 with a girl I liked. I kept waiting for her to call. She [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=492.08s)]
*  kept waiting for me to call. And we never got together. And there was something beautiful that [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=495.84s)]
*  could have happened out of that. I don't know what she's doing with her life now. But that's [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=500.32s)]
*  the story of the American economy. This is a bunch of relationships, productive, healthy [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=504.4s)]
*  economic relationships, which are on hold on pause and being destroyed because the president [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=510.64s)]
*  doesn't have the courage to pick up the phone. You know, David Jolly, Ryan's right that the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=516.24s)]
*  president talked about terrorists on the campaign trail. And there's a soundbite that I've played [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=522.08s)]
*  on this show for years now where Donald Trump says to an audience of his supporters, quote, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=526.08s)]
*  don't believe your eyes, don't believe your ears, just believe me. And we've covered that soundbite [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=530.72s)]
*  because it's so dystopian. It's where he was heading with propaganda and with delegitimizing [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=535.12s)]
*  trust in the media, which he's had a lot of success in that endeavor. But he was talking [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=540.4s)]
*  about tariffs. He's talking about tariffs because his press secretary in this year [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=544.16s)]
*  went out and said tariffs are not a tax. Tariffs are a tax. Republican senators have said so much. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=548.96s)]
*  And the American people understand that. You tell me where you think we are right now. And at this [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=555.04s)]
*  point, where the politics land for Republicans who've done nothing to help the American small [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=561.68s)]
*  business owner, the American consumer, the American family, the people who voted for Donald Trump, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=566.16s)]
*  who'd been convicted of 34 felonies in large part because of the price of things. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=572.0s)]
*  Yeah, Nicole, very simply to play off of the president's words, the American people don't [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=578.88s)]
*  believe him now. They just simply don't believe him. The world markets certainly don't believe [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=582.7199999999999s)]
*  him. They believe the actions, but they don't believe his words and the actions are going to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=586.7199999999999s)]
*  make the world and certainly America less prosperous. And that is driving the economic [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=591.2s)]
*  uncertainty of consumers and voters, but also the economic uncertainty that will lead to the pullback [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=595.5200000000001s)]
*  in industries across the country. And I think what you're seeing from, certainly from the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=601.6800000000001s)]
*  sophisticated markets and industry, but an awareness of by voters and consumers as well is [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=606.48s)]
*  to redomesticate industries requires subsidizing those industries. Donald Trump is not getting up, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=613.5200000000001s)]
*  giving speeches about how he intends to subsidize the return of certain industries. He's just saying [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83gVd2OCzI&t=620.0s)]
