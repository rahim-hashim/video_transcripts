# 'The P.T. Barnum of wire fraud': Fmr. prosecutor on George Santos sentencing
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM)
*  NBC News correspondent Raheema Ellis is outside the courthouse on Long Island and here with me in New York, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=0.0s)]
*  former federal prosecutor Barrett Berger and former prosecutor Paul Callen. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Okay, Raheema, set the scene. What is going to go down today? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=9.52s)]
*  What we think is going to go down is a very short story compared to the years of deceptive stories [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  that George Santos has been accused of and has now admitted to committee. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=21.76s)]
*  And when he goes into this courtroom for a hearing before the judge, this is a sentencing hearing, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=26.56s)]
*  he and the prosecution, they've already presented letters to the judge about what their expectations [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=32.16s)]
*  are and hopes are. Santos saying that he wants a minimum sentence along with the aggravated [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=36.56s)]
*  identity theft charge that he's pled guilty to. That carries a mandatory minimum of two years in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=43.12s)]
*  prison. He says he wants that minimum. But the prosecution is asking for so much more, anywhere [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=49.12s)]
*  from more than seven years in prison because they say, despite the fact that last summer, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=54.56s)]
*  George Santos came to this courthouse and expressed his regret, his remorse and his guilt on two of the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  charges, as you mentioned. The prosecution says that he has since done everything but that in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=65.68s)]
*  terms of his actions and showing no remorse. And they are concerned if he's not given a hefty sentence, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  that he has a proclivity for recidivism, if you will, because showing no remorse for these crimes [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=77.36s)]
*  he committed and that he has admitted guilt to. Anna? Barrett, this is your former office. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=83.76s)]
*  Prosecutors asking for seven years. Does seven years fit the crime? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=91.28s)]
*  In my mind, it does. But it's not, they're just not pulling this number out of nowhere. They're [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=95.12s)]
*  not just making this number up. It's actually a pretty scientific process to get to this number. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=100.48s)]
*  So what the prosecutors will do and what the judge will ultimately do during sentencing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=105.44s)]
*  is they look to two things. The first is the statute. So as we mentioned, it's a 24-month [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=109.36s)]
*  mandatory minimum sentence, right? The judge has no wiggle room in this. She has to sentence into [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=115.76s)]
*  at least two years. But that two-year sentence has to run consecutively to what he gets on the other [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=120.56s)]
*  count. And his guideline range, the other part of this scientific process is what's called the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=126.72s)]
*  sentencing guideline range. That is 51 to 63 months. So these two things have to go consecutively, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=131.6s)]
*  which gets you right into that seven-year range. So absolutely reasonable because it's prescribed [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=137.68s)]
*  by both the guidelines and the statute. But even more than that, it really fits the brazen [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=142.8s)]
*  public nature of this crime. I mean, this wasn't just a con man doing sort of small-scale crime in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  his backyard here. This was somebody taking public office, stealing money from people who had [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=153.84s)]
*  contributed to his campaign and really putting us into a potentially risky situation for our [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=160.24s)]
*  national security by having all these lies out there as a public figure. And yet, Paul, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=165.52s)]
*  Santos' lawyers say he should get the minimum. He's also agreed to pay thousands, hundreds of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=170.24s)]
*  thousands of dollars in fines, and they are focusing on the nonviolent nature of his crimes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=175.52s)]
*  They write this in a letter to the court. His conduct, though involving dishonesty and abuse [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=180.24s)]
*  of trust, stemmed largely from a misguided desperation related to his political campaign, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  rather than inherent malice. How strong is that argument? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=190.08s)]
*  Well, the lawyers have to come up with something to say and have come up with this. Their client [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  is the P.T. Barnum of wire fraud and identity fraud. I mean, he runs for a congressional seat [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=199.44s)]
*  in Long Island on a completely fraudulent resume, saying he had worked at Goldman Sachs and was [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  successful there and for Citigroup, that he's the owner of 17 properties, essentially that he's an [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  extremely wealthy individual, a graduate of Baruch College, by the way. He never went to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=217.92s)]
*  Baruch College. He never worked at Goldman Sachs. Nobody vetted the guy, and somehow he was elected [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=222.48s)]
*  to Congress. So he's somebody who really abused the system. And I think when the judge looks at [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=227.76s)]
*  this, she's going to see somebody running for public office to represent the people of Long [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=234.16s)]
*  Island, who is a complete fraud. And I think judges come down hard on people who abuse public service. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  There's kind of a double standard and a higher standard, I think, that applies to people who are [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  in public service. And I think that's the problem his attorneys are going to face when they see [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=251.44000000000003s)]
*  their clients sentenced today. And Rahima, he did plead guilty, but ahead of the sentencing, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=256.48s)]
*  he has been attacking the DOJ, saying on social media, they want me to go to prison for 87 months [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=262.48s)]
*  while they let sex traffickers walk freely. They give drug lords slaps on the wrist. He also claims [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=268.88s)]
*  that cabal of pedophiles operate in the government, all while the DOJ gets to, quote, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=274.0s)]
*  step on my neck. So those are among the many posts he's been putting out there. Prosecutors say this [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=278.96s)]
*  proves he's not remorseful. How is Santos defending these posts? Well, Santos says that he should be [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=283.92s)]
*  allowed to still speak for himself in terms of his feelings. I want to show you a full screen of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=291.28s)]
*  some of how he says, responds to all of that. He says, I did this to me. I am responsible. But [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=296.64s)]
*  saying I'm sorry does not require me to sit quietly while these prosecutors try to drop an [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=303.12s)]
*  anvil on my head. That's the kind of thing that the prosecutors are going to be presenting to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=308.96s)]
*  the judge, because on one hand, he says he's responsible. And on the other hand, he's accusing [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=314.0s)]
*  the prosecutors of doing something to him that he has already admitted guilt to. So it's sort of a [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=318.32s)]
*  double standard. In some way, it's kind of what George Santos has done. As far as his public life [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=324.4s)]
*  is concerned, he said that he is one thing, as was just mentioned, but the reality is that he's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=329.68s)]
*  something very different. Ana? There at this free speech framing, what's the argument the prosecutors [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  will make against that? Yeah, I mean, it's exactly the idea that you are showing no remorse if you [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=341.6s)]
*  are still speaking lightly of your crimes. Even the title of his podcast, Pants on Fire, makes it [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=347.36s)]
*  seem like he thinks this is a joke, that this was all just, you know, farcical. But these were real [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=352.64s)]
*  people that were affected. It was a real public office. He stole real money, and he defrauded [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=357.76s)]
*  people out of funds that they had worked hard for. So this is a real crime. I think the judge will [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=363.12s)]
*  look very disfavorably on all of his comments, on things that he said on the podcast, all of his [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=367.84s)]
*  behavior. And remember, the judge has a lot of freedom when she's sentencing him to take this [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=373.44s)]
*  into account, not only because it relates to the crime, because it relates to his acceptance of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=378.56s)]
*  responsibility, how seriously he takes these offenses. Paul, as we understand it, Santos did [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=383.76s)]
*  not solicit any letters of support from family or friends. How unusual is that, and could that work [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=389.28s)]
*  against him? Well, it's very unusual, but I think probably the family and friends have been defrauded [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=394.96s)]
*  by his false claims, as well as the public. So it doesn't surprise me at all that he has very little [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=400.24s)]
*  support from his family. He's a strange, bizarre individual. And he got elected to Congress at a [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=406.4s)]
*  time when his vote was critical to keep the Republican majority. And so they delayed in [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=411.76s)]
*  throwing him out of Congress, essentially, because they needed his vote. And so he had this bizarre [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=419.12s)]
*  career of running on a fraud, serving in a fraudulent position when everybody knew he didn't deserve [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=424.0s)]
*  to hold that position. And now he's claiming a free speech right to explain why he's not [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=429.92s)]
*  being remorseful about his crime. It's not going to help him in front of the judge. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=438.24s)]
*  Sounds like you both agree the judge is likely to come down hard on Santos. We'll be watching, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=441.6s)]
*  and of course, staying on top of it, Raheema will keep us posted as this hearing gets underway. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=446.56s)]
*  Thank you all for joining us, Raheema Ellis, Barrett Berger, and Paul Callan. Appreciate it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pC81_yXlM&t=451.36s)]
