# 'It was devastating': Trump admin cancels local arts grants across U.S.
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE)
*  Yet another cancellation that could impact your community. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=0.0s)]
*  The Trump administration is slashing funding for local arts programs across the country. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  Multiple programs were notified by the National Endowment for the Arts about these cuts late [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=8.64s)]
*  last week, saying they did not, quote, reflect the nation's rich artistic heritage and creativity [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=13.88s)]
*  as prioritized by the president. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=19.28s)]
*  Now, the impact already being felt in Portland, Oregon, where a local production of August [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=21.32s)]
*  Wilson's Joe Turner's Come and Gone learned just a day before their opening performance [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  that the government was revoking its $25,000 reward. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=31.68s)]
*  And joining us now is the producing artistic director at the Portland Playhouse, Brian [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=36.96s)]
*  Weaver. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=42.0s)]
*  Brian, it's great to have you here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=43.0s)]
*  I'm sorry you have to be here under these particular circumstances. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=44.56s)]
*  How much are these cuts going to impact your production? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  Thanks, Anna. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=51.64s)]
*  It's such a pleasure to be on. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  We were hearing the news on the eve of opening night. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=56.68s)]
*  Opening night is a night of celebration. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  So we were doing the final things, getting ready. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=62.08s)]
*  There's buzz, there's excitement. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=65.0s)]
*  I had zipped off for a quick dinner with my family and I saw the message. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=66.44s)]
*  And I mean, it represents about 20 percent of the fees that pay the actors, the technicians, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=71.52s)]
*  carpenters, electricians, I mean, people whose jobs were, we were in the middle of it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=79.32s)]
*  We were opening. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=84.84s)]
*  So it was devastating. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=85.84s)]
*  It was easy to be afraid. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=87.92s)]
*  I'm sure you were awarded $25,000. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=91.28s)]
*  So help me understand. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=94.68s)]
*  Has that money already been spent? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=95.84s)]
*  Are you going to have to repay that? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we're spending it right now. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  So the grant was awarded six months ago. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  We had received the email that you fight so hard for, you work so hard for, which is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=110.76s)]
*  congratulations, your project has been selected. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=115.68s)]
*  And the NEA funds grants through a process, a community review process. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  So people all over the country are on these panels. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  And it's not just the money, but it's also the validation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=126.72000000000001s)]
*  It's artists from all around the country, from all districts across the country saying, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  this is the project, this play by August Wilson, this is the one that we want to fund. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=135.4s)]
*  And so to have that revoked. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=140.4s)]
*  I mean, I guess we thought maybe money in the future wouldn't be coming, but we didn't [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=144.04s)]
*  think that something we had gotten six months ago would be taken away. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=150.12s)]
*  And so the NEA is now essentially saying that your production doesn't reflect the nation's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=153.36s)]
*  artistic heritage. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=157.8s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=159.24s)]
*  I think there's a long history in America of erasing black history. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=161.96s)]
*  And I think that it's American history. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=166.96s)]
*  August Wilson is one of America's or America's greatest playwright. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=169.36s)]
*  And so to say that this history is not American history is an affront. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=174.84s)]
*  It's just not true. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=180.0s)]
*  Sadly, you're not alone. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=182.72000000000003s)]
*  Thousands of arts programs could see cuts. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=183.96s)]
*  We've also seen President Trump effectively remake the Kennedy Center in his image. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=186.8s)]
*  He's routinely criticizing the arts as a whole, just in general on social media. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  What do you make of all this? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=196.72000000000003s)]
*  And what is the impact? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=198.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the arts bring us together. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=201.12s)]
*  So the arts are not an elitist. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=204.12s)]
*  You know, the arts are the people where our our home, our theater is in a church, the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=207.39999999999998s)]
*  former Mount Sinai Baptist Church, the neighborhood church. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=212.84s)]
*  And and we we have free beer, we have popcorn. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=216.84s)]
*  It's a place where people I mean, people were married here, people buried family members [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  here. So it's a place that is. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  Deeply rooted in this community, it's Portland's King neighborhood, it's the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=228.16s)]
*  historically African-American neighborhood, and it is so it's it's not a extra. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=234.44s)]
*  It is the fabric of our lives and its stories and stories are what I mean, stories are our [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=242.6s)]
*  past. We have to understand our history. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=249.16s)]
*  We have to understand our history in order to go forward. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  And so. But you know what? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=254.12s)]
*  It's trying to stop artists telling stories or trying to stop community coming together is [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=258.16s)]
*  like trying to stop water from flowing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=262.6s)]
*  So you can put up a dam or a wall and it's going to go around. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=265.12s)]
*  So you can't stop it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=268.6s)]
*  And certainly getting an order like this isn't going to stop us or going to stop artists [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=271.56s)]
*  from telling the stories. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=276.04s)]
*  We appreciate you sharing with us what you are working on and the impact of of some of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=277.6s)]
*  these decisions that we're seeing in Washington and then how it's affecting communities like [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=283.72s)]
*  yours there in Portland, Oregon. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=288.32000000000005s)]
*  Really appreciate your time. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=289.56s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us, Brian Weaver. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=291.12s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYepK5aItVE&t=293.56s)]
