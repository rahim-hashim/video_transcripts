Video Description: For weeks, the administration has battled over a judge’s order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the administration admitted was mistakenly removed to a notorious Salvadorian prison despite an immigration judge’s ruling that should have protected him from being deported there. And this week, a federal judge ruled the Trump administration must facilitate the return of another wrongly deported man.

# ‘Elections do not change the Constitution’: Judges pump brakes on Trump’s disregard for due process
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o)
*  But we begin this hour with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and its ongoing disregard [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=0.0s)]
*  for the fundamental constitutional right of due process. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  You know, something light for the early morning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=8.92s)]
*  Late Friday night, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=10.92s)]
*  return of a gay Guatemalan man identified as OCG in court filings. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=15.4s)]
*  The man was deported to Mexico despite fearing persecution and telling U.S. authorities he [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=20.76s)]
*  had been raped and held captive there. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=25.2s)]
*  U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy wrote in his 14-page ruling that OCG's removal likely, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=27.88s)]
*  quote, lacked any semblance of due process and that, quote, OCG did not receive what [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=33.28s)]
*  the Constitution requires. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=39.0s)]
*  And this is obviously not an isolated case. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  It is at least the third that we know of improperly deported man that a judge has ordered the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=44.08s)]
*  Trump administration to return to this country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=49.84s)]
*  For weeks, the administration has battled over a judge's orders to facilitate the return [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, who the administration admitted was mistakenly removed to a notorious [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=56.64s)]
*  Salvadorian prison despite an immigration judge ruling that should have protected him [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=61.88s)]
*  from being deported there. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=67.08s)]
*  And earlier this week, a federal appeals court refused to lift another judge's order to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=68.68s)]
*  facilitate the return of a 20-year-old Venezuelan refugee identified as Christian, who was [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=73.64s)]
*  deported earlier this year to El Salvador despite having pending asylum claims here [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=79.52s)]
*  in this country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=85.12s)]
*  Joining us now are David Beer, Director of Immigration Studies at the Cato Institute, and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=86.36s)]
*  Sky Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=90.6s)]
*  In this new case of OCG, Sky, I want to get into the word facilitate because we heard it [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=94.8s)]
*  from the Supreme Court and I talked to some folks in the administration who said they [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=101.08s)]
*  were happy that they just said the word facilitate because it gave them a gray area. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=105.52s)]
*  No one knew what the hell it meant. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=108.96s)]
*  But this judge says, quote, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=110.28s)]
*  The court notes that facilitate in this context should carry less baggage than in several [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=112.4s)]
*  other notable cases. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=117.84s)]
*  OCG is not held by any foreign government. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=118.88s)]
*  Defendants have declined to make any argument that facilitating his return would be costly, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=121.16s)]
*  burdensome or otherwise impede the government's objectives. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=126.16s)]
*  The court anticipates that defendants will take at least the same level of action as [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  is routine to return lawfully removed aliens. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=133.6s)]
*  It seems like he's learned his lesson from some of these other cases where the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=137.44s)]
*  administration kind of waffled on the word facilitate. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=140.24s)]
*  Finally, the administration keeps trying to double down on what Justice Jackson has [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  called catch me if you can justice. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  And you see the judges, though, being very strong that this is not what we do in the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=149.44s)]
*  United States. You see them becoming more savvy to the administration's tricks. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=153.8s)]
*  And I think that as concerned as we are for all of the people and by the way, there are [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=158.24s)]
*  so many who have been removed without process in many instances. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=162.72s)]
*  The good piece of this is that the judges are not having it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think you're going to continue to see that build over the next few weeks. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  It is just unfathomable how many men and women who are in America legally have been [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=175.12s)]
*  deported by the Trump administration. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=184.44s)]
*  It's a level of sloppiness and disregard for human rights in the Constitution that I [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  just it's unimaginable in American history. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=190.68s)]
*  Can you talk about how you went through and you documented all of the men and women who [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=193.36s)]
*  were illegally taken from America, even though they were here under the law? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  Right. So the Trump administration expelled, really rendered these individuals from [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=205.32s)]
*  Venezuela to El Salvador to a prison. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=212.4s)]
*  They are imprisoning them at our expense. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  Again, no charges, no trials, not even a hearing before their removal. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=218.32s)]
*  We went through and we documented at least 50 cases, 50 out of the 250 who were sent, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=223.56s)]
*  50 cases of people who came legally to the United States. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=230.32s)]
*  They never violated any immigration law. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=233.8s)]
*  And the whole premise of the administration's argument here is people came here illegally. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=236.68s)]
*  So they have no due process. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  They have no rights whatsoever under the Constitution. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=243.8s)]
*  These people came legally at the invitation of our government. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=246.36s)]
*  They were detained and then ultimately expelled without a hearing, without due process. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=249.96s)]
*  And that's the concern here for everyone who has who, whether you are a U.S. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=255.08s)]
*  citizen, whether you're a legal permanent resident, whether you're someone else who's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=259.64s)]
*  come here legally. You this is what the administration's advertisement to the world [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=263.0s)]
*  of what America does to people who come to our country. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=269.0s)]
*  We don't give you any rights. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=272.32s)]
*  And that should be not only scare immigrants who are coming here, but Americans who are [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=274.04s)]
*  traveling abroad, because we will have no right to object when a country does that to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=278.32s)]
*  a U.S. citizen traveling abroad to an authoritarian country who does these kind of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  things. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=289.28s)]
*  And your study is not the only one that has found this right over and over and over again. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=289.56s)]
*  Reporters, think tanks like yours, other organizations, random people have looked [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=293.56s)]
*  through these lists and found it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=298.2s)]
*  So it's not just like you guys saying. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=299.52s)]
*  And, Sky, let's keep the conversation talking on U.S. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  citizens. And I would put up this NBC News headline, U.S. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=305.08s)]
*  citizen with real ID handcuffed and held in immigration raid before being released. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=308.52s)]
*  And quoting here, apparently a real ID is not valid anymore. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  He has a real ID, his cousin, Shaila Venegas, said. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=316.96s)]
*  We all made sure we have the real ID and went through the protocols the administration is [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=320.08s)]
*  asking for. He has his real ID and then they see him. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  And I guess because his English is fluent and or because he's brown, it's fake. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  It's not real. And I read that also because, you know, I was at a memorial service [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  yesterday in Chicago and was told by a friend that a friend of the son of a friend of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=339.0s)]
*  theirs, American citizen snatched up by immigration. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=346.48s)]
*  They couldn't find them. They have found him. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=352.04s)]
*  But now they're having conversations about whether they should carry passports with [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  them to prove their their citizenship. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, the and I bring this up because, you know, he ran Trump ran on deporting [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  violent, illegal, quote unquote illegals. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=368.55999999999995s)]
*  And now you have law abiding American citizens fearing that they could get snatched [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=372.28s)]
*  up, especially if they're black or brown. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=379.44s)]
*  And it was never about immigration policy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=381.08000000000004s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing, because if it was, you would actually see the president [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=383.64000000000004s)]
*  using lawful processes, which he's not interested in. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  We have said that every single American should be concerned about these cases. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=390.04s)]
*  And we've been saying that at Democracy Forward for some time as we've litigated these [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=393.72s)]
*  cases in the courts, because we know if it can happen to Mr. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=397.44s)]
*  Garcia, if it can happen to people on planes where judges tell you to turn the planes [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=400.56s)]
*  around in the administration, gleefully, the judge found did not. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=406.04s)]
*  It can happen to any of us. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  And that's really what due process is. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=411.44000000000005s)]
*  And it seems that this administration is just inconvenienced by the rights that everyone [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  in this country has. They are inconvenienced by the Constitution. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=417.84000000000003s)]
*  It is clear that their strategy is being run out of the White House by people like Stephen [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=420.64000000000004s)]
*  Miller, who were not even lawyers, who appear to even yesterday in his tweets, be [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  completely inconvenienced and upset that the American people have a Constitution that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=429.16s)]
*  entitles them to rights and that it is judges jobs to enforce those rights. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  So the president himself has said we can't possibly give due process to all these people. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=438.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  Like that is, well, sir, the Constitution says, keep it persons. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=443.71999999999997s)]
*  It does not say citizens will have the right to have. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=447.2s)]
*  Well, and that is actually what it means to live in America and that what it means is [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=449.4s)]
*  what it means to be an American. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=452.52s)]
*  And for all of the rhetoric out of the White House about how people are a threat to our [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=453.92s)]
*  way of life, it is this that's a threat to the American way of life. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=458.44s)]
*  It is due process that separates this country from places like Russia and Iran and China. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=461.76s)]
*  And you are not seeing this administration actually double down on the things that are [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=467.04s)]
*  uniquely American. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=470.76000000000005s)]
*  David, you know, what Scott was talking about, the judges kind of getting savvy to what the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=471.92s)]
*  administration has done. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=476.48s)]
*  They also seem to be getting irritated. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=477.64000000000004s)]
*  Right. And frustrated. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=479.32000000000005s)]
*  And I've never been in front of no judge, but I do imagine watching a good wife and [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=481.36s)]
*  scandals. They when you piss them off, they will come back at you. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=485.04s)]
*  So I guess my question, I think a lot of people have this question. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=489.16s)]
*  What's the recourse that judges have when the administration continues to either piss [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=491.64000000000004s)]
*  them off or defy their orders? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=496.56s)]
*  Look, we have seen an escalation even at the Supreme Court level. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=498.2s)]
*  It's kind of unprecedented for the Supreme Court to act so quickly to stop Alien Enemies [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=502.8s)]
*  Act expulsions from the United States. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=508.24s)]
*  So we can see an escalation in what they're ordering the Trump administration to do, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=512.44s)]
*  taking away the powers that the administration is claiming. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=518.24s)]
*  And ultimately, they can hold them in contempt. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=522.44s)]
*  Now, this is something that the House of Representatives is upset about. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=524.68s)]
*  They want to change the law and effectively prevent judges from being able to hold this [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=528.48s)]
*  administration in contempt, which would jeopardize all of our rights in the United States, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=533.96s)]
*  because this is the ultimate power that judges have to hold someone in criminal contempt [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=539.08s)]
*  for violating their orders. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=544.48s)]
*  But in the immediate near term, what about these men and women who the U.S. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=546.16s)]
*  government judges have said they are unlawfully detained and taken out of the country, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=552.24s)]
*  bring them back. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=557.84s)]
*  When are they going to be brought back? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=559.2s)]
*  Right. Well, I do think you see the judges escalating the tools that they have. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=560.72s)]
*  You see the judges over the just over the last week asking the government really hard [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  questions, bringing them in, saying you have to explain what you're doing. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=569.84s)]
*  What are you doing to give people process to give them access to the lawyers? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=573.0s)]
*  And so I do think that you're going to see, like you said, the judges and the courts do [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=577.0400000000001s)]
*  have power. They do have power now to enforce their orders. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=581.76s)]
*  And you're seeing that you're already seeing questions of contempt in a number of cases. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=584.68s)]
*  But I wrote down the word defiance because that's all we have seen from the Trump from [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=589.24s)]
*  the president and his administration. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=594.2s)]
*  The courts say do this. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=596.4s)]
*  I don't care the language they use. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=598.08s)]
*  Facilitate. Go to the go to the thesaurus. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=599.3199999999999s)]
*  It's a bring the man home. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=601.52s)]
*  And they've done nothing, whether it's an order from the Supreme Court or a federal [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=603.28s)]
*  judge or a district judge. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=608.0s)]
*  And so at what point, what can be done when the Trump administration flat out ignores [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=609.48s)]
*  a very clear edict or not edict ruling from the Supreme Court? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  Because I have no confidence that the Trump administration, the president will listen [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=623.72s)]
*  to the Supreme Court despite what the president has said he would do. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=627.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=630.44s)]
*  Well, they bring the leader of that country into the Oval Office. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=630.72s)]
*  They both saying I'm not sitting in the back and I'm not asking for. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=634.36s)]
*  Right. Well, I'll just say I think that this is a [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=637.44s)]
*  place for the president and the administration is pushing way too far. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=639.36s)]
*  First of all, you have contempt proceedings that are going to happen. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=642.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, these judges have said and so the American people are going to see that on display. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=645.48s)]
*  But poll after poll and the most recent one says over 80 percent of the American people, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=649.2s)]
*  including many of the people who are in the president's base, believe that people in this [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=654.44s)]
*  country should follow court orders and that the president should follow court orders. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=658.92s)]
*  And so this is there is going to be political accountability. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=663.2s)]
*  The people ultimately, I do think are going to have to hold this administration accountable [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=665.92s)]
*  and the allies in Congress who seem to want to be able to pull the rug out from under [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=670.36s)]
*  the American people and render the courts, which are the actual institutions that protect [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=674.8s)]
*  our rights, you know, to try to render them meaningless. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=679.6s)]
*  But they don't have armies. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=682.6s)]
*  I guess I'm just like, you know, like, how do they force it? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=684.16s)]
*  You put contempt on the on the on the DOJ lawyers and then. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=687.64s)]
*  I mean, there are. I mean, there are professional disciplinary proceedings. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=691.68s)]
*  And by the way, you're going to see a similar cast of characters in this Massachusetts [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=694.32s)]
*  case that you talked about from Friday. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=698.2800000000001s)]
*  There's a similar lawyer, the same lawyer that's also in Judge Boasberg's case here in [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=700.44s)]
*  Washington. So I think that there is professional responsibility consequences. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=704.9200000000001s)]
*  There is civil contempt that can lead to fines and imprisonment that cannot be pardoned. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=708.5200000000001s)]
*  And then there are criminal contempt proceedings. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  And I think, unfortunately, this administration is getting so close to the fire. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=715.72s)]
*  You're going to start seeing those things play out. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=719.6400000000001s)]
*  And the judges have made it clear that they are taking their authority seriously. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-fhW3fOQ5o&t=721.48s)]
