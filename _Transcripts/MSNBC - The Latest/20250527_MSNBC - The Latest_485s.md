# ‘Just kill it’: Sen. Peter Welch on Trump's budget bill
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo)
*  Senator, it is good to have you with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=0.0s)]
*  What did you hear from the prime minister? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=2.32s)]
*  How much time do you think we have to turn this around? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  We've got to get going right away. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=7.32s)]
*  I mean, there's two things. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=9.6s)]
*  One, Canada is astonished, both at the emotional insult of the 51st state talk, but also the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  practical impact of these tariffs and how we've been great trading partners and really [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=18.68s)]
*  close allies. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=24.36s)]
*  And suddenly, President Trump's made a decision to challenge that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=25.36s)]
*  What they are fortunately intending to do is cooperate as much as possible. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  But it's also clear that they don't necessarily have confidence in the follow through of Trump [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=36.32s)]
*  and they don't feel that they can really count on him. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=41.36s)]
*  So they're going to take independent actions as well as trying to do as much as they possibly [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=44.72s)]
*  can to maintain their relationship with us. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=49.2s)]
*  In our message to them, bipartisan led by Senator Shaheen and Senator Kramer, who has [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=52.44s)]
*  a very close relationship with Trump, is we love Canada. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=59.24s)]
*  That relationship is important to us economically. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=63.36s)]
*  It's really important. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=65.88s)]
*  Vermont is our biggest trading partner, but that's true for 34 states. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=66.88s)]
*  So it's important that we stay together. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  Senator, to your important point about the relationship, it's not just an economic one. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=73.92s)]
*  It's also the national security interests that we share with Canada. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=79.76s)]
*  So to your point, that relationship matters on a lot of levels. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  You referenced your colleague, Senator Kramer, who was the only Republican on the trip. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=87.64s)]
*  He noted that I don't want to get in Donald Trump's way, but at the same time, I want [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=93.64s)]
*  to be an encourager to Canada and their officials and try to be a partner in some way. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=100.52s)]
*  Hopefully I navigated it okay, but I'll find out on Truth Social. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=106.56s)]
*  That to me is the disturbing part of this. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=113.24s)]
*  We cannot have an honest relationship with our partners to the north because of the fickleness [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  of the guy who's sitting in the Oval Office and the concern that senators like Kramer, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=125.56s)]
*  who co-chairs the Canada-U.S. Parliamentary Group in Congress, know the importance of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=132.96s)]
*  those relationships. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=140.44s)]
*  How do you navigate this space when you have such a bad actor or not a good faith actor [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=141.8s)]
*  in the president when you're having these conversations with your Canadian counterparts [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=148.76s)]
*  and ministers and leaders trying to, as you started at the beginning, make this relationship work? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=153.92s)]
*  Well, two things. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=160.88s)]
*  One, you identified exactly what the Canadian dilemma is. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=161.88s)]
*  They thought they could take for granted a very cordial, very open relationship with [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=165.44s)]
*  the United States. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=171.48s)]
*  And obviously, President Trump shattered that with his decisions, not just the emotional [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=172.64s)]
*  insults, but also the tariffs that are very damaging to our biggest trading partner. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=178.12s)]
*  But second, from our perspective, we've got to remind Canada by showing up in person, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=184.2s)]
*  and it was incredibly helpful to have Senator Kramer there, that the vast majority of Americans [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=190.44s)]
*  want to maintain those personal ties that we have to Canada and our trading relationship. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=196.88s)]
*  And one of the things that Senator Kramer said that we all agreed with, Canada is our [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=202.56s)]
*  ally. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=207.88s)]
*  You know, President Trump's challenging that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=208.88s)]
*  But we have a, they're not our adversary. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=210.96s)]
*  Our common adversary is China. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=213.04s)]
*  And in fact, Canada imposed very severe tariffs on China about steel and aluminum. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=215.44s)]
*  So they've been stepping up to assist us in our challenge with China. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=223.52s)]
*  You know, I do think it's important to note that the president did post on True Social. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=231.16s)]
*  Senator Kramer was, had some foresight into that, I guess. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=234.76s)]
*  And he said that he claimed that Canada is considering the offer to become the 51st state [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=239.36s)]
*  and be part of the Golden Dome system. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=244.28s)]
*  I will now hold my breath. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=246.8s)]
*  Can we switch to tariffs while we have you? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=248.6s)]
*  Because Japan, there's all these things happening. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=251.08s)]
*  Japan is talking about spending $6.3 billion to shield its economy from Donald Trump's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=259.8s)]
*  This was out today. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=260.8s)]
*  Spain unveiled a $15 billion tariff aid package last month. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=261.8s)]
*  And then you have the president of the United States last week saying that Apple has to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=264.6s)]
*  make their iPhones in America. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=269.68s)]
*  He went on to say it would just be Apple products. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=272.48s)]
*  It would be all phones because it, quote unquote, wouldn't be fair. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=274.16s)]
*  And Axios has reported the notes, and this is from an equity research analyst, for U.S. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  consumers, the reality of a $1,000 iPhone being one of the best-made consumer products [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=282.92s)]
*  on the planet would disappear, making iPhones in New Jersey or Texas or another state would [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=287.12s)]
*  boost their price tag to about $3,500 instead. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=291.56s)]
*  It is, please, because people are going to say I'm being dramatic. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=295.44000000000005s)]
*  It is not realistic for iPhones or Samsung phones to be made in America. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=298.8s)]
*  Well, you're exactly right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=303.88s)]
*  The iPhones will be the biggest tax-send consumers in generations. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=311.16s)]
*  And it will undercut our trade relationship and the strength of our economy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=312.16s)]
*  Targeted tariffs, where you've got dumping by China, I think a lot of us are totally [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=316.52s)]
*  open to that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=320.52s)]
*  But tariffs against your friends, when it's going to essentially be a tax on consumers, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=321.52s)]
*  and it's unraveling relationships that we need in order to be pushing back against [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  China make no sense. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=331.68s)]
*  And in fact, the other aspect of this that I think is very dangerous is a place under [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  the corruption agenda of Trump, because these tariffs are not uniform. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=337.48s)]
*  If you know Scott Besson, you have his phone number or the president's phone number, you [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=344.32000000000005s)]
*  give him a call like Apple did early on, and you get exempt from the tariffs. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=349.76s)]
*  But if you're a small manufacturer of these water bottles, like the Vermont firm that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=354.32s)]
*  was in The Times today, you're out of luck. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=360.04s)]
*  So he's turning the, he, Trump, is turning the economy into one that's based on who [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=364.88s)]
*  you know, access, as opposed to a competitive product, a competitive price and good service. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=370.1s)]
*  So when you are not traveling the globe, giving a reassurance tour to foreign leaders over [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=376.21999999999997s)]
*  whether or not they can in fact trust their allyship with the United States, you are preparing [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=382.88s)]
*  to deal with Donald Trump's big, beautiful bill. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  Your colleague, Senator Ron Johnson, has said he has enough support to hold up the budget [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=389.96s)]
*  bill, essentially wants to go through it line by line and look for additional cuts. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=395.47999999999996s)]
*  You leave Ron Johnson alone in a room with this bill, doing a line edit. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=401.08s)]
*  What more of our social safety net gets cut? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=407.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, he cut everything he could get his hands on. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  But there's an element of Ron Johnson and Rand Paul that actually I have some sympathy [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  with. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=419.16s)]
*  This bill will not help our economy. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=420.16s)]
*  It'll hurt it and it will explode our deficit. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=422.48s)]
*  It's going to take money from people who need it and from our institutions that need it. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=426.40000000000003s)]
*  It's going to give tax cuts to billionaires who don't need those tax cuts. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=431.96000000000004s)]
*  And what's really happening now that's extremely dangerous. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=436.48s)]
*  It's pushing up interest rates. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=440.08000000000004s)]
*  The bond market is in revolt. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=441.68s)]
*  That means your credit card bills are higher. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=444.28000000000003s)]
*  If you want to borrow money for a car, it's higher. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=446.20000000000005s)]
*  And we're now already paying more for the national debt service than we do on Medicare, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=448.72s)]
*  more than we pay for the military. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=455.40000000000003s)]
*  So this is an economically really bad bill. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=457.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think we should just kill it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmE_38BB0Uo&t=462.88s)]
