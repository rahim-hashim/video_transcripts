# ‘Flailing in the breeze policy’: Fmr. State Dept. official slams Trump Middle East trip
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4)
*  Joining me now is former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Joel Rubin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=0.0s)]
*  Joel, welcome to you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Vladimir Putin now says he wants these direct talks with Ukraine without preconditions. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=4.76s)]
*  Should Putin be taken at his word about this? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=10.44s)]
*  And if so, what might have brought him to this point? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=14.16s)]
*  Ah, you're laughing. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=17.04s)]
*  So, expand on that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=18.04s)]
*  I apologize for laughing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=19.04s)]
*  And by the way, happy Mother's Day, Alex. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=20.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=22.04s)]
*  And I really, really enjoy being with you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=23.04s)]
*  I'm laughing because I guess it should just be what does Vladimir want today? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  That should be the American policy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=30.16s)]
*  You know, we have a policy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=32.76s)]
*  It's about a ceasefire. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=34.44s)]
*  Putin says he doesn't want that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=35.44s)]
*  Instead, he wants direct talks now without pausing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=37.16s)]
*  And apparently, that's now our new policy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=40.28s)]
*  It's really American weakness personified. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=43.28s)]
*  I do give President Trump credit for pushing publicly that there should be a ceasefire. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=46.64s)]
*  And I do think that he's gotten Putin's attention. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=52.4s)]
*  But we can't be chasing the Russians like this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=55.04s)]
*  We need to set up some clear parameters. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=57.04s)]
*  We need to work with our allies. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=58.92s)]
*  This goes to the bigger fundamental picture, which is that we're not negotiating from a [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=60.68s)]
*  position of strength or organizing negotiations at all from a position where we have allies [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=65.4s)]
*  alongside us and really put the pressure on Vladimir Putin to come to the table. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=71.56s)]
*  And so we're doing what we see, which is sort of flipping in the breeze, depending upon [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=75.84s)]
*  what Vladimir Putin wants today versus yesterday. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=80.6s)]
*  So then you have Ukraine assisting on the temporary, a full ceasefire before any negotiations [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=84.12s)]
*  start. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=88.88000000000001s)]
*  Look, both sides accuse the other of breaking every limited ceasefire that has been in existence. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  Neither side trusts the other. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  What are the odds, Joel, that we see face-to-face talks May 15th? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  You know, I guess we could say 50-50. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=101.28s)]
*  You're right. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  Look, there's no trust. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  There's no love lost. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  These warring parties have been going at it for three years. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  Too much loss of life, a tremendous impact on Europe, hundreds of thousands dead. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=110.64s)]
*  They need to get the talks. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=116.28s)]
*  They need to get a ceasefire as part of that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=117.28s)]
*  And Vladimir Putin needs to understand that he cannot get conquest as part of a gift for [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=119.8s)]
*  this kind of policy he has towards Ukraine. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=125.56s)]
*  I think those parameters need to be clear. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=128.16s)]
*  And we need to stick to our policy and push Vladimir Putin, quite frankly, to stop his [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=130.84s)]
*  aggression into Ukraine so there can be legitimate talks on the way forward. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  OK, we're going to watch this very carefully. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  Let's move to what happens Tuesday, which is, as he did in his first term, Trump heads [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=142.56s)]
*  to the Middle East for the first major foreign trip of his second term with a stop at a summit [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=146.92s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  Then he goes to Qatar and then the United Arab Emirates. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=153.88s)]
*  The White House said the goal is to secure economic agreements that includes the prospect [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=156.72s)]
*  of a $1 trillion amount of investments and a $100 billion arms package with the Saudis. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=161.24s)]
*  But, Joel, this is happening after Israel approved new plans to seize and occupy Gaza. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=167.96s)]
*  What does it tell you with trade and economic investments being Trump's first order of business [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  and not diplomacy? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=177.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Alex, this goes back to what we were just discussing on Russia-Ukraine. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=180.0s)]
*  It's sort of a flailing in the breeze kind of policy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=184.56s)]
*  It seems like President Trump's just walked away from the Gaza issue when it comes to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  diplomacy and stopping that war and getting the Israeli and the American hostages out [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  and bringing some kind of future towards Gaza that the Palestinian people believe in and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=196.4s)]
*  that promotes Israeli security. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=201.56s)]
*  And now there are big concerns that he may be cutting a deal with Saudi Arabia towards [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  providing a civilian nuclear program or something of that variation without getting normalization [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which is a longstanding American strategic priority. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  And to walk away from that would be a major loss for the United States in bringing calm [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=220.72000000000003s)]
*  to the region. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=224.96s)]
*  It, of course, would also show how unpopular and damaging this war between Israel and Hamas [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=225.96s)]
*  is for Israel standing in the region. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=231.28s)]
*  So a lot going on. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  He has a chance to bring people together. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  And instead he's not. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  He's just sort of going into the region and cutting deals for the United States rather [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  than being a broader peacemaker. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  Hey, Joel, can I ask you quickly what you make of NBC News confirming that there's going [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  to be a palace in the sky for Donald Trump? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=247.96s)]
*  He's getting a luxury jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar to be used as the new Air [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=250.36s)]
*  Force One appearance, an estimated $400 million. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  It could be the most valuable gift ever extended to the U.S. from a foreign government. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=258.44s)]
*  Give me your sense of concerns or is this A-OK with you? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I'll say I'm really glad you brought it up. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a fascinating story. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=271.24s)]
*  Look, you just said the key thing here, which is that it's a gift to the American people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=272.92s)]
*  It's not a gift to Donald Trump. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=277.16s)]
*  What concerns me is the idea that this would somehow go to a Trump entity after 2028. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=278.72s)]
*  No, this is a gift to the president of the United States. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  And the president of the United States is an office that belongs to the American people. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  So great. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=291.8s)]
*  Take the airplane, refurbish it, pay using taxpayer dollars for the flight attendants [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=292.68s)]
*  and the security. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=299.24s)]
*  And then we get to keep it for the next president, too. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=300.6s)]
*  It should not be going to anything associated with Donald Trump on a personal level after [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=303.16s)]
*  this term is up. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=308.04s)]
*  Which is what you've pointed out. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  It is supposed to go to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation after this, right before [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=310.76000000000005s)]
*  the end of his term. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=315.24s)]
*  Well, we'll see if others think it's a problem, too. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much in the meantime, Joel Rubin. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=318.44s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwVDBw1CB4&t=320.32000000000005s)]
