# 'Big beautiful bill for billionaires': Dem lawmaker slams Trump budget plan
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8)
*  I'm joined right now by the ranking member from the Budget Committee, Pennsylvania Democrat [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=0.0s)]
*  Brendan Boyle. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=4.5s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=5.5s)]
*  I was privy to hearing you vote no, not unexpectedly, on this bill. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  But does this vote give Democrats any more leverage and any more influence over the legislation [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=13.24s)]
*  going forward? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=19.26s)]
*  Well, good to be with you on, I think, a pretty dramatic day. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=20.26s)]
*  We started at 9 a.m. and from the very outset of the hearing, Budget Committee Democrats [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=24.74s)]
*  made it quite clear that we were in total unified opposition to this monstrosity, the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=31.52s)]
*  big, beautiful bill for billionaires. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=38.54s)]
*  The reality is that our united opposition today meant that Republicans had to get almost [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=41.34s)]
*  100 percent of their members to vote yes in order for this to advance. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=48.86s)]
*  So I'm proud of our performance and what we've been able to do so far in blocking this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  The next step, though, I think that we have to be on guard. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=59.62s)]
*  And here's why. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=64.46s)]
*  It was hardliners on the Budget Committee, really extreme conservatives who are holding [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=65.98s)]
*  out. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=71.22s)]
*  They're not satisfied that only, from their perspective, 13 and a half million Americans [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=72.38s)]
*  will lose their health coverage. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=78.3s)]
*  They actually want deeper cuts to Medicaid and deeper cuts to the Affordable Care Act. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=80.34s)]
*  So I fear that this bill, which is already right now very bad, could actually get worse [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=85.58s)]
*  in order to win over the support from these very hardline conservative Republicans. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=91.86s)]
*  And we heard my colleague Ryan talking to Steve Scalise earlier, at least before the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=97.36s)]
*  vote he thought they were making progress. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=104.22s)]
*  Would it take just a few tweaks to get it passed? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=107.54s)]
*  What do you think the road looks like ahead? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=110.26s)]
*  How rocky is it? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=112.5s)]
*  So Republicans really, and frankly this will come down to President Trump and House and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=113.9s)]
*  Senate Republican leadership, they really have two choices, right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=119.5s)]
*  They can either, A, pacify their hardline conservatives and make what is already projected [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the accepted referees and scorekeepers when [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=130.66s)]
*  it comes to all of this, established in law by Congress. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=136.78s)]
*  They're the ones, as written, will cause 13.7 million Americans to lose their health care. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=140.02s)]
*  Republican leadership can either, A, actually drive that number up and make it even worse [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=148.78s)]
*  through deeper Medicaid cuts and deeper cuts to the Affordable Care Act, or B, they can [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=153.74s)]
*  finally say, you know what, enough with attempting to pander to the most extreme conservative [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=166.18s)]
*  Let's actually try bipartisanship for once. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=167.18s)]
*  Let's actually work with Democrats. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=169.7s)]
*  Let's figure out a way to extend the tax cuts for most working class and middle class Americans. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=171.78s)]
*  Let's actually look at finally bringing in more revenue and allowing the tax cuts to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=178.26s)]
*  expire on the billionaire class, which would bring in a lot of revenue. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=182.33999999999997s)]
*  And let's reject this extreme path and work with Democrats to achieve bipartisanship. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=186.98s)]
*  If they're willing to do that, we on the Democratic side are willing to work with them to extend [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=192.1s)]
*  the tax cuts for most working Americans. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=197.98s)]
*  But at the same time, we have no interest whatsoever in working with Republicans who [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=200.73999999999998s)]
*  want to devastate health care for so many Americans. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=205.26s)]
*  Ryan Nobles had said it would take just four no votes to tank this bill in the Budget Committee. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=209.33999999999997s)]
*  I believe it lost by five. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=215.45999999999998s)]
*  Are you surprised with the increasing opposition, it would seem, to the bill? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=218.7s)]
*  Well, it would have taken three Republicans in the Budget Committee voting no, or excuse [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=224.85999999999999s)]
*  me, it would have only taken two voting no in order to cause a tie vote and then three [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  gave the no side our side in this, the majority. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=239.18s)]
*  So the fact that it ended up being four, well, technically it ended up being five, but that's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=242.98s)]
*  actually a parliamentary procedure. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=248.62s)]
*  One of the members who was voting yes switched his vote at the last second so that way come [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=251.82s)]
*  Monday they could use something called a motion to reconsider and attempt to re-vote it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=258.24s)]
*  So often you will see on the House floor in committee on the rare occasions, the very [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=263.18s)]
*  rare occasions when a majority is not able to win the vote, they'll typically have one [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=268.7s)]
*  of their members switch so they can file what is typically called an MTR. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=274.76s)]
*  So a little bit of, you know, in the weeds, parliamentary stuff there, but that's the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=280.18s)]
*  reason why they did that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=284.82s)]
*  I would say really there were four Republican no votes, which was, you know, far more than [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=285.82s)]
*  was actually needed to sink the bill. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=293.46s)]
*  Okay, well I'm glad you described it as being in the weeds because let me tell you something [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=295.21999999999997s)]
*  otherwise it would be very clear I was not a math major. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=298.38s)]
*  Thank you, Brendan Boyle, it's very good to talk with you, especially on this really, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  really important day. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=304.97999999999996s)]
*  Appreciate that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=305.97999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRIW4r2G5e8&t=310.14s)]
