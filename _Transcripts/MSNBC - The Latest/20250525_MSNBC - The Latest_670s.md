Video Description: The Trump administration’s war on the rule of law is most evident in its relentless attacks on American judges who rule against the former president’s policies. Attorney General Pam Bondi recently escalated that rhetoric, calling these judges “deranged”—a remark that former federal judge J. Michael Luttig found especially alarming. “The judges are not deranged, Pam Bondi. They are simply enforcing their oath to the Constitution of the United States—the same oath that you, Madam Attorney General, took yourself.” In this timely and urgent interview, the former federal judge warns, “I don’t know where this ends... but it appears that, in this moment, the President intends to prosecute this war against the federal judiciary–and the rule of law– to its catastrophic end.”

# Judge Luttig: Trump’s war the judiciary could see 'catastrophic end'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4)
*  Joining me now is our good friend, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=0.0s)]
*  Judge Michael Ludig, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=1.9000000000000001s)]
*  former federal just judge for the US [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=4.72s)]
*  Judge Ludig, welcome again to the show. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=6.44s)]
*  Thank you, Ali. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=9.5s)]
*  It's always a pleasure. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=10.28s)]
*  I want to ask you when Donald Trump's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=11.48s)]
*  team when the when the government [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=13.72s)]
*  arrested a sitting judge and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=15.6s)]
*  paraded her before the cameras, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=17.3s)]
*  what were you thinking writ large [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=19.16s)]
*  about our justice system at that point? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=20.96s)]
*  Alley as you suggested. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  But as the Chief Justice of the United [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=29.26s)]
*  States said publicly last week, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=32.54s)]
*  the rule of law is endangered. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  On his first day in office in January, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=38.54s)]
*  this president essentially declared [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=42.06s)]
*  war on the federal judiciary. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=44.58s)]
*  The Constitution and the rule of law. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=48.1s)]
*  And for every day since then until this day, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=51.86s)]
*  the president himself, his vice president, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=56.92s)]
*  his top White House aides and his cabinet [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=60.42s)]
*  have been threatening the federal [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=64.32s)]
*  judiciary. In an obvious effort to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=67.88s)]
*  delegitimize the federal courts in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=71.82s)]
*  the eyes of the American public. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  And it's working, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=77.64s)]
*  and that's why the president continues it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=79.66s)]
*  As you know, just recently the vice [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=83.16s)]
*  president has taken the argument [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=86.32s)]
*  to the Supreme Court directly. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=89.5s)]
*  Most recently. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=92.32s)]
*  Urging the Chief Justice of the United [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=94.38s)]
*  States to get the federal judiciary [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=97.78s)]
*  under control. Well, Alley, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  that tells it all. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=103.22s)]
*  It's not the federal judiciary [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=105.44s)]
*  that's out of control. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=108.22s)]
*  It's this president and his administration. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=110.46s)]
*  They are waging war on the federal [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=114.22s)]
*  judiciary and the rule of law and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=117.74000000000001s)]
*  the federal judiciary of course. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=121.3s)]
*  Has responded in kind by essentially [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  striking down at least preliminarily, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=127.56s)]
*  if not ultimately every single [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  signature initiative of this president [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=134.26s)]
*  during his first 100 days in office. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=137.34s)]
*  Now that's not retaliation by the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=142.12s)]
*  federal courts to the contrary. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=145.08s)]
*  The federal courts are interpreting [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=147.88s)]
*  and applying the Constitution of the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=150.68s)]
*  United States and the laws of the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  United States to the clearly unlawful [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=157.64s)]
*  acts and actions of this president. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  Turning then to the arrest, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=166.52s)]
*  the arrest of Judge Duggan, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=169.22s)]
*  as you suggested, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=171.5s)]
*  was really the. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=173.17999999999998s)]
*  The beginning of the culmination. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=174.54s)]
*  Of this war on the federal courts [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=178.7s)]
*  and and the rule of law. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=181.98s)]
*  Judge Duggan did nothing other than [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=184.33999999999997s)]
*  show a litigant in front of her. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=187.73999999999998s)]
*  Out a side door that led directly [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=191.26s)]
*  into the public hallway in front [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=194.66s)]
*  of her courtroom. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=198.16s)]
*  Rather than have that litigant exit [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  the front door of the courtroom where [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=203.2s)]
*  she knew. Judge Duggan knew. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=207.16s)]
*  Federal agents were awaiting to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  arrest the litigant before her. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  Of course, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=217.14s)]
*  that's nothing more than trying to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=218.04s)]
*  maintain decorum and respect in her [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  own courtroom and courthouse. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  And of course, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  what we heard from the Attorney General [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=227.96s)]
*  of the United States of America. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  Alley was it the judges of the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  United States are deranged? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=236.72000000000003s)]
*  That's the word that the Attorney [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=238.8s)]
*  General of the United States used [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  to characterize the federal and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=244.84s)]
*  state judges of America know. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=247.54000000000002s)]
*  The judges are not deranged. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=251.52s)]
*  Pam Bondi. They are simply enforcing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=254.52s)]
*  their oath to the Constitution of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=259.14s)]
*  the United States, the same oath that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=262.86s)]
*  you Madam Attorney General took yourself. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=267.06s)]
*  I don't know where this ends. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=270.94s)]
*  Alley, but it appears at this moment [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=273.74s)]
*  that the president. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=277.34000000000003s)]
*  Is is intends to prosecute this war. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=279.34000000000003s)]
*  Against the federal judiciary and the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=284.74s)]
*  rule of law to its catastrophic end. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=287.44s)]
*  I want to ask you as a former senior [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=292.18s)]
*  member of the federal judiciary. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=295.26s)]
*  When judges, I mean the president, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=297.65999999999997s)]
*  we you and I discussed this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=299.74s)]
*  He said to my colleague, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=301.58s)]
*  Kristen Welker, went asked very directly. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=303.26s)]
*  Is it your job to uphold the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=305.09999999999997s)]
*  Constitution that I don't know? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=307.09999999999997s)]
*  I got lawyers on the case. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=308.85999999999996s)]
*  The vice president United States [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=310.62s)]
*  is a Yale educated lawyer, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  and he's done all this stuff. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=313.9s)]
*  But what happens when federal judges [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=315.76s)]
*  no longer believe that they are either [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  safe because there are actual [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=320.0s)]
*  threats against them or independent? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=321.64s)]
*  Both of those are threats to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  the federal judiciary. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=325.12s)]
*  What happens to the system? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=326.08s)]
*  You know, Ali, first off, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=327.52s)]
*  you know that what the president [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  United States actually said to your [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=331.4s)]
*  colleague was very seriously. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=333.78s)]
*  To her question, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  do you have an obligation to uphold [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=338.88s)]
*  the Constitution? The president leaned [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=342.04s)]
*  forward and said I don't know. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=345.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=349.66s)]
*  I have said that those are perhaps [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=352.5s)]
*  the most important words ever spoken [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=355.56s)]
*  by a president of the United States, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=358.3s)]
*  saying that he doesn't know whether [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=361.36s)]
*  he is obligated to uphold the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  Constitution. The vice president. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=366.38s)]
*  Yes, he's he's a lawyer trained. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=368.6s)]
*  And so we're we're presumptively. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=371.62s)]
*  He knows what he's talking about. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=375.48s)]
*  But to listen to him, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=377.96s)]
*  he has no clue what he's talking about. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=379.96s)]
*  Now. What we do know from what he says. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  And this is what your viewers [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=387.4s)]
*  need to understand. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=390.12s)]

*  vice president United States do not believe? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=394.14s)]
*  That under the Constitution of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=398.54s)]
*  the United States it is the Supreme [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=400.47999999999996s)]

*  Another way to put it more academically [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  is they do not believe in the bedrock. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=411.44s)]

*  Where Chief Justice Marshall first wrote. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=419.88s)]
*  Not long after our founding. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=423.88s)]
*  That it is the responsibility of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=426.7s)]
*  the Supreme Court to decide what the law is. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=429.88s)]
*  Not the president, not the Congress, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=435.3s)]
*  the Supreme Court. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=438.86s)]
*  Many people in in MAGA, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=441.14s)]
*  many Republicans, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=443.46s)]
*  and certainly this president. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=444.86s)]
*  And the vice president, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=447.14s)]
*  they would overturn Marbury against [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=449.06s)]
*  Madison to the extent that the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=451.62s)]

*  This is it doesn't get any more [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=462.6s)]

*  Well, you know, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=467.0s)]
*  in the time the UNI have known each other, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=467.88s)]
*  we've had conversations I didn't [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=471.0s)]
*  expect that we'd ever be discussing [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=472.52000000000004s)]
*  on on television, but one of them, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=474.32s)]
*  as you know, is that the US Federal [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  Martial Service, which protects most [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=478.72s)]
*  federal judges answers to the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=480.2s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=481.72s)]
*  there are some people who are saying [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  maybe it's time to figure out a [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=484.92s)]
*  different way to protect judges. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=487.0s)]
*  The Attorney General of the United [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=488.62s)]
*  States has said about judges [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=490.34000000000003s)]
*  that they're deranged. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=491.90000000000003s)]
*  What's your what's your take on this? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=492.94s)]
*  Well, let me explain for your audience. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=495.54s)]
*  The the the Martial Service [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=498.74s)]
*  protects the federal judges. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=501.22s)]
*  But the Martial Service is located [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=503.86s)]
*  within the Department of Justice. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=506.58000000000004s)]
*  So basically what's what we have today, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=509.18s)]
*  given the threats against the federal [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=513.7s)]
*  judicial judiciary by the President [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=516.82s)]
*  of the United States, the Vice President, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=519.4000000000001s)]
*  his administration and the Attorney [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=523.08s)]
*  General is that you have the protection [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=525.9200000000001s)]
*  of the federal judges under the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=529.5600000000001s)]
*  supervision and control of the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=532.44s)]
*  President and the Attorney General. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=534.9200000000001s)]
*  I if I were a sitting judge today. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=538.72s)]
*  I literally would not accept the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=542.48s)]
*  martial service protection. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=545.54s)]
*  From this administration in light [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=548.46s)]
*  of all that we've known, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=550.76s)]
*  no and and frankly, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=553.18s)]
*  Ali all that we're being told every day [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=555.22s)]
*  by the President and his administration. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=558.06s)]
*  Why would any judge believe that he or [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=560.14s)]
*  she would be protected by the martial [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=563.38s)]
*  service and that that brings to the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=566.18s)]
*  forefront your your question as you know, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=568.8199999999999s)]
*  and your audience needs to know [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=572.3s)]
*  there have been serious discussions [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=575.1999999999999s)]
*  among the policy organs of the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=578.4399999999999s)]
*  federal judiciary. As to whether. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=582.3599999999999s)]
*  The judiciary can count on the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=586.4399999999999s)]
*  martial service in the Department [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=588.9399999999999s)]
*  of Justice under Pam Bondi to protect them. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=591.16s)]
*  There's no reason at all to think. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=595.5999999999999s)]
*  That the martial service would [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=599.0s)]
*  protect the federal judges when [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=601.5999999999999s)]
*  they rule against this administration [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=604.18s)]
*  and this president because as we know, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=606.66s)]
*  every time that a judge so far has [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=610.1s)]
*  ruled against the President or his [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=613.36s)]
*  administration, the President, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=616.4599999999999s)]

*  judge by name with impeachment and [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=629.54s)]
*  otherwise. Ali this to me is just [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFS68lyXT4&t=632.64s)]
