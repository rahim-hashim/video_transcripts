# 'Some places are never for sale': Canada PM hits back after Trump talks 51st state
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk)
*  I want to go back to you if I can as I bring in Von Hilliard, Rick Sengel, Henrietta Trayes, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=0.0s)]
*  Brian Chung. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=6.84s)]
*  If I can go back to you, Rick, because we were talking about what you were looking for, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=7.84s)]
*  and I think tone is always interesting. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=10.76s)]
*  The president just referencing what happened when we saw, let's say, a little blow up with [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  the president of another country in that very same Oval Office, probably in those very same [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  chairs. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=25.52s)]
*  It almost sounded diplomatic, but the president was not backing down on the U.S.-Canada border [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=26.64s)]
*  and making it the 51st state. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=35.96s)]
*  Let me play that for you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=38.3s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=40.4s)]
*  So what he said was, it's a beautiful, you know, as a real estate developer, I'm a real [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  estate developer, when you get rid of that artificially drawn line, someone drew that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=47.56s)]
*  years ago with a rule, just a straight line across the country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=52.36s)]
*  I'm a very artistic person, but when I look at that, I say that's the way it's meant to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=56.68s)]
*  be. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=62.04s)]
*  And then, Rick, the comeback from the prime minister of Canada was that there are some [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=63.04s)]
*  places that are never for sale. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  He mentioned Buckingham Palace. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=74.2s)]
*  He mentioned the Oval Office. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=75.64s)]
*  He said of Canada, it's not for sale. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=77.34s)]
*  It won't be for sale ever, to which the president said, never say never. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=79.86s)]
*  And I bring that up because the whole idea of the 51st state is not the most important [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=86.52s)]
*  thing we heard there, but I think the tone of it and where they seem to be going and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=91.42s)]
*  the relationship to the tariffs that have caused this breach with our nearest neighbor [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=98.1s)]
*  is fascinating. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=104.18s)]
*  Tell me what you saw and heard there. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=106.4s)]
*  Well, Chris, this is so much to process. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the first thing I'll say is how incredibly unorthodox it is to take questions before [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=114.02000000000001s)]
*  the conversation with your fellow world leader. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=122.5s)]
*  There's probably 75 or 80 years of American history where when the president takes questions [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=125.30000000000001s)]
*  with the head of state, each president takes it afterwards when they have something to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=132.58s)]
*  talk about. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=137.0s)]
*  The fact that he spoke for nearly 40 minutes before even beginning the conversation is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=138.0s)]
*  highly irregular. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=143.62s)]
*  And of course, as you see, he's utterly unprepared for the conversations with the Canadian president, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=145.18s)]
*  prime minister. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  He's unprepared for all the other questions that he got. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=158.0s)]
*  There's a foreroggo of mistakes that he made. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=162.88s)]
*  I mean, this figure that he uses of our trade deficit with Canada of $200 billion, it's [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=165.6s)]
*  nothing like that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=170.56s)]
*  The highest figure I've seen is $60 billion, and it's probably more like half of that $30 [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=171.56s)]
*  billion. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=177.68s)]
*  The, you know, American cars, there are dozens and dozens of American cars, large percentage [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=178.68s)]
*  of which are made in Canada back and forth between Detroit and Canada. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  This relationship with Canada is a marvel in the world that countries are very jealous [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=192.4s)]
*  of. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  Two thriving, prosperous democracies with a free trade between each of them. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  This idea that, you know, that deficits are not, are something that are negative. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, as Milton Friedman said, he has a big deficit with his barber. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=211.84s)]
*  His barber doesn't buy anything from him. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=216.56s)]
*  Capitalism works because there are reasons that American factories need to use Canada [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=219.84s)]
*  for things, and there are reasons that Canadian factories need to use the U.S. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=224.24s)]
*  That's how capitalism works. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=229.52s)]
*  It's more effective for the consumer. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=230.88s)]
*  It's more efficient. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=232.44s)]
*  The prices are lower. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=233.44s)]
*  And then finally, I would say, you know, as we often see with Trump, he will say things [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=236.96s)]
*  on social media in all caps that are angry and hostile, and then when he meets the person, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=242.24s)]
*  he's cordial. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=248.68s)]
*  I mean, that's not a bad thing, but it isn't always very consistent. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=249.68s)]
*  I'll stop there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  He did say you ran a really good campaign, and it is an honor to have you here after [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  he kind of eviscerated him on social media. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=262.56s)]
*  I also want to bring in a White House correspondent, Peter Alexander. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=265.92s)]
*  Peter, this is something we have seen before, you know, as Rick was just pointing out, until [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=269.24s)]
*  Donald Trump, you didn't seem to start negotiations in what was normally a photo op. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=274.8s)]
*  Normally they, and you've been in them before, I've been in them before, they're photo ops. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  Now they become sort of mini press conferences. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=286.08000000000004s)]
*  Let me ask you specifically about trade, because obviously tariffs is a key issue between the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=288.88s)]
*  United States and Canada. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=294.12s)]
*  The president is saying that the administration has been working for weeks on trade deals, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=296.2s)]
*  and one day we'll come and we'll give you a hundred deals. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  And then he said, they don't have to sign. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  Tell us where we are. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=309.76s)]
*  Do we know where we are on these negotiations? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  Our understanding was that for many weeks, administration officials have been trying [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=314.36s)]
*  to come to deals, and we haven't heard any of them announced. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=318.64s)]
*  They've been teasing an announcement with a foreign country over the course of the last [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=323.04s)]
*  several weeks. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=327.92s)]
*  There hasn't been any formal announcement made yet. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=328.92s)]
*  The speculation has been that it's likely an Asian country with whom the U.S. says it's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  been having conversations, South Korea, Japan, perhaps even India here. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=334.32s)]
*  But we don't have any answers to that specifically. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=338.92s)]
*  As it relates to the negotiations that took place and the conversation you've been having [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=340.88s)]
*  here, a couple of things struck me. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=344.72s)]
*  One, it wasn't so much just that the negotiating or the public statements began before the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=346.36s)]
*  conversation between the two took place. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=351.12s)]
*  They began even before Mark Carney arrived at the White House with the president trying [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=353.35999999999996s)]
*  to sort of set the tone, demonstrating that he's going to be on offense and trying to [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=357.12s)]
*  cast himself as the sort of one going on offense with his post on social media, his favorite [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=361.28s)]
*  megaphone, even before Carney arrived, even before the cameras entered the Oval Office [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=367.56s)]
*  there. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=372.28s)]
*  Specifically, as it relates to trade, I was struck by some of the language the president [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=373.28s)]
*  used, where he said, among other things, regarding other countries, where he says the pressure [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=376.12s)]
*  is on them to agree to deals with the U.S. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=379.8s)]
*  He said, they have to sign deals with us. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=382.48s)]
*  They want a piece of our market. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=384.76s)]
*  We don't want a piece of their market. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=386.28s)]
*  He also said, in effect, that, you know, we will set the terms of it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=388.4s)]
*  I'll meet with my team, Scott, Scott Besant, J.D., J.D. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  Vance, the vice president, and Howard, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, saying basically [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=395.08s)]
*  we'll tell them what the terms are going to be and then they can either accept it or not. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=399.2s)]
*  That's not traditionally the way the deals are made. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=402.76s)]
*  Obviously, the White House has been teasing negotiations, but the president here is sort [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=405.56s)]
*  of trying to push back on what has been a common source of criticism, how the president [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=409.96s)]
*  claims or insists he's going to be able to get 90-plus trade deals done with 90 independent [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=414.96s)]
*  countries over the course of 90 days, three months before the expiration of those deals, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=420.64s)]
*  that baseline that he set on so many of these countries for the tariffs when he made the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=427.96s)]
*  announcement on what he described as Liberation Day and as it relates to China, most notably, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=433.24s)]
*  where so much of the impact is being had on the U.S. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=438.03999999999996s)]
*  economy. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=442.24s)]
*  As you talk to businesses, some of those business leaders, Home Depot, Walmart, Target, all [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=443.24s)]
*  meeting with the president, making a direct warning to him about the impact over the course [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=449.08s)]
*  of the summer into the fall where there could be empty store shelves or certainly a lack [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=453.4s)]
*  of product. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=457.08s)]
*  The president acknowledged today publicly that there have been no direct negotiations [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=458.08s)]
*  with China yet, just a desire to talk right now. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=462.20000000000005s)]
*  But obviously, that is where the rubber meets the road given how much the U.S. relies on [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=465.72s)]
*  and purchases product from China right now. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  That at the end of the day, for all the countries he wants to make deals with, that's one that [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=474.6s)]
*  still has been a major obstacle in terms of his desire for some success. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=477.96000000000004s)]
*  Peter Alexander, thank you. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=481.56s)]
*  So Henrietta, the president also said he could sign 25 deals right now but said, we don't [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=483.68s)]
*  have to. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=489.40000000000003s)]
*  He also seemed to take some umbrage at the fact that he said the press is constantly [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=490.64s)]
*  reporting that this is chaotic. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=495.15999999999997s)]
*  He says what we are is flexible. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=497.47999999999996s)]
*  But how do you think companies, how do you think Wall Street hears what they just heard [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=500.76s)]
*  from the president right now? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=504.56s)]
*  Well, as somebody who talks to Wall Street all day, I'll tell you the two things that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=506.08s)]
*  I found most important. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=509.76s)]
*  Number one, there's no deal coming with Canada, who, contrary to the president's assertions, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=510.76s)]
*  is our biggest trading partner. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=515.64s)]
*  So we have no near-term potential for a de-escalation in the 25 percent tariffs, the 10 percent [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=517.24s)]
*  baseline tariffs, the 10 percent tariffs on potash and energy. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=524.12s)]
*  And that's going to be a huge negative for U.S. farmers who are not going to like to [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=527.72s)]
*  hear that, which is why, of course, we're talking about a bailout for U.S. farmers as [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=530.8s)]
*  the president perpetuates this trade war. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=535.32s)]
*  So for Wall Street, the number one thing to know is that we don't have a near-term deal [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=537.16s)]
*  with our biggest trading partner. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=540.44s)]
*  The second biggest thing is also from the perspective of the U.S. consumer, which, as [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=542.16s)]
*  you know, is 80 percent of the U.S. economy. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=547.48s)]
*  The president just referred to the U.S. consumer as the ultimate luxury shopper. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=550.44s)]
*  I think that's going to come as quite a surprise to American families who have, on average, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=554.68s)]
*  $1,000 in savings. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=559.2s)]
*  So this is not to be used on buying dolls, as the president asserted earlier this week. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=561.16s)]
*  But when you have a 25 percent tariff on cars, four tires that you have to buy at the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=566.42s)]
*  same time when you need a new car, a new muffler, whatever those products are, that's what the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=571.62s)]
*  consumer is going to be paying for. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=577.02s)]
*  And there are no deals on any countries of magnitude in the foreseeable future. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=578.9s)]
*  I don't think Prime Minister Carney really even needed to be there because the conversation [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=585.0999999999999s)]
*  was not about reaching a conclusion to bring those tariffs off. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=588.62s)]
*  And the president flatly said they were not coming off. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=591.38s)]
*  Nothing in this conversation would take them off today. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=593.94s)]
*  It wasn't just what he said. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=596.62s)]
*  It was the way he reacted. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=598.1s)]
*  And if you were watching the face of the prime minister, look at him when the president says, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=599.62s)]
*  you know, we don't do much business in Canada, the way he looks, the way he moves his head. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=604.86s)]
*  What is the challenge for him, who again was just elected because he was going to stand [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=611.8800000000001s)]
*  up to Trump? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=617.3800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=618.3800000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=619.3800000000001s)]
*  And what is he there for? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=620.3800000000001s)]
*  We're going to get an announcement on something plainly not Canada and Mexico trade agreement. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=621.82s)]
*  It's probably not even related to trade. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=626.38s)]
*  And I think that the prime minister had to go. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=628.9399999999999s)]
*  I think it's an important opportunity for him to assert to his constituents that they [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=631.06s)]
*  will not be becoming the 51st state. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=634.7s)]
*  He belabored repeatedly that they're not for sale. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=637.14s)]
*  So I think a lot of this is just for headline effect that pleases President Trump, but it [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=639.3s)]
*  does not do anything to help the U.S. consumer. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=643.9399999999999s)]
*  And it does nothing to advance the U.S.-Canada dialogue. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xqDMvGsoqk&t=647.22s)]
