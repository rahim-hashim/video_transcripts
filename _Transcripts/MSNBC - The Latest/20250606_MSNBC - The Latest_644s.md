# Immigration expert: Trump admin ‘trying to reverse engineer' Kilmar Abrego Garcia case
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg)
*  Breaking a short time ago, Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, the Maryland man mistakenly deported by the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump administration to El Salvador, is back on U.S. soil to face charges related to transporting [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=5.3s)]
*  undocumented migrants. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=11.38s)]
*  The federal indictment came weeks after the Supreme Court ordered Trump officials to facilitate [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=13.18s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia's return. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=18.98s)]
*  The president, his lawyers, and cabinet members had resisted bringing him back. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=21.0s)]
*  Here's Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, who went to visit Abrego-Garcia in El Salvador [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=25.82s)]
*  with our colleague Nicole Wallace. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=30.740000000000002s)]
*  I've said repeatedly, repeatedly, this is not about the man, Abrego-Garcia. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=34.38s)]
*  This is about his constitutional rights and really the rights of all of us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=40.94s)]
*  That if President Trump and his administration can trample the rights of one person, the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  rights of all of us are at risk. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=50.38s)]
*  Lisa Rubin is back with us and joining the conversation, Andrea Flores. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=54.13999999999999s)]
*  She is the vice president of immigration and policy campaigns at Forward.us. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=58.099999999999994s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  Welcome, Andrea. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=64.38s)]
*  What did you make of this indictment and how do you interpret the backwards nature in which [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=66.14s)]
*  this has all transpired? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  It's clear they're trying to reverse engineer reasons why they claimed for months that they [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=73.74s)]
*  couldn't bring back Mr. Abrego-Garcia. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=78.34s)]
*  So they said from the very beginning there was no way that the El Salvadoran government [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=80.26s)]
*  would allow them to return. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=83.98s)]
*  That was always a fabrication because ICE wrongly has deported people in the past. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  And we know now that the truth was revealed. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=91.10000000000001s)]
*  They also brought back someone else who was wrongfully returned this past week, a man [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=93.9s)]
*  to Mexico. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=97.62s)]
*  But this is really just like a first step. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=98.62s)]
*  We have to see it that way. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=100.78s)]
*  There are over 200 people who are being indefinitely detained under very suspicious legal circumstances. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=101.78s)]
*  And so they're showing that they can do it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=109.34s)]
*  And now they're also trying to fabricate a reason why they didn't. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=111.7s)]
*  I am struck, Lisa, by the insistence of so many government officials in this matter who [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=114.66s)]
*  took such a hard edge, such a demanding edge against Mr. Abrego-Garcia. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=125.0s)]
*  In a particular way, our Homeland Security Director, Chrissy Noem, who made it very clear [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=132.74s)]
*  under no circumstances, I do not see any circumstance in which Mr. Garcia will return to the United States. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=138.46s)]
*  But here we are. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=145.66s)]
*  And to Andrea's point, it upends this legal system in a way. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  This back and forth as we've seen in trade issues and other issues, this administration [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=152.42s)]
*  is all over the map. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=157.18s)]
*  They push in one direction until they can't push anymore. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=158.28s)]
*  How do you see the case against Mr. Abrego-Garcia actually moving forward when it seems to the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=162.26s)]
*  points Andrea made, this is all kind of made up. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=171.06s)]
*  They were very clear in one space. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=174.26s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, there are all these legal issues that touch on due process, which was [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  the initial argument, right? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=181.26s)]
*  That's what everybody's saying. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=183.26s)]
*  Due process. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=184.26s)]
*  Why are you taking it? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=185.26s)]
*  Okay, so if he's a criminal, put him through the system. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=186.26s)]
*  Now they want to do that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=188.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's a bizarre reversal, Michael, particularly given the positions that they have been taking [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=190.06s)]
*  in the civil litigation that Abrego-Garcia's lawyers brought for literally months now. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=197.06s)]
*  And I just want to remind you and our viewers, it was April 10th that the Supreme Court said [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=202.06s)]
*  that the U.S. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=208.86s)]
*  Government must facilitate his release and return to the U.S. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=209.86s)]
*  So that he could exercise those due process rights that you were just referring to. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=214.76s)]
*  But I want to pick up on something that you just said that is really meaningful to me, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=219.7s)]
*  because I think the way that government officials from the White House press secretary to the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=223.42s)]
*  president himself to secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, to her spokesperson [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=228.7s)]
*  Trisha McLaughlin at the department and even Pam Bondi, the attorney general today, that's [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=234.17999999999998s)]
*  not the language that we usually use in this country when we're speaking about people that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=239.22s)]
*  we expect to be criminal defendants, because you don't want to pollute the well. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=243.82s)]
*  You don't want to taint the jury pool. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=248.2s)]
*  And here they have spoken about Mr. Abrego-Garcia repeatedly, including up to and through today, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  in a way that assumes his guilt and makes it very challenging for him to get a fair [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=257.47999999999996s)]
*  trial given the national celebrity that he now inadvertently has and never asked for. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=262.46s)]
*  So if I were his lawyers, one of the things I would make a big deal out of is the fact [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=268.28s)]
*  that the government has acted in a way here that has deprived him of an ability to get [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=273.62s)]
*  a fair trial in the middle district of Tennessee where he has now been indicted. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=279.46s)]
*  You don't talk about somebody you expect to indict as if it's already been decided that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=283.86s)]
*  they were a criminal. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=289.86s)]
*  That's not your decision to make. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=290.86s)]
*  That's a decision for the jury of his peers. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=292.54s)]
*  That is as fundamental to our system of democracy and our rule of law as almost anything else [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=294.5s)]
*  that I can think of, Michael. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=299.26s)]
*  Now, Glenn Ivey essentially said the same thing earlier today. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=301.38s)]
*  We don't need to play it, but he goes on to say that how the Department of Justice did [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=304.86s)]
*  this is backwards. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=309.62s)]
*  And when he prosecuted MS-13 cases, they didn't deport them first. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=310.62s)]
*  You prosecute them first. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=314.5s)]
*  You convict them. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=315.5s)]
*  Then you deport them. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=316.5s)]
*  Just so folks at home understand what Lisa is talking about, this is what some of the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=318.3s)]
*  indictment says. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=321.3s)]
*  This is what it says about Abrego-Garcia having transported firearms but didn't charge him [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=322.3s)]
*  with such. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=326.90000000000003s)]
*  In addition to transporting undocumented aliens, their word, not mine, and firearms at times, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=328.09999999999997s)]
*  Kilmar, Armando, Abrego-Garcia occasionally and simultaneously transported undocumented [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=333.09999999999997s)]
*  aliens and narcotics purchased in Texas for distribution and resale in Maryland. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=338.53999999999996s)]
*  Though the Department of Justice states that the smuggling of firearms and narcotics is [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=344.29999999999995s)]
*  a fact, they haven't charged him with that in the indictment. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=347.82s)]
*  They also say over the past nine years, the defendant has played a significant role in [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=350.21999999999997s)]
*  an undocumented alien smuggling ring that has resulted in thousands of undocumented [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=356.02s)]
*  aliens being illegally transported into and throughout the United States, including members [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=361.02s)]
*  and associates of MS-13, a recently designated foreign terrorist organization, as well as [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=366.02s)]
*  unaccompanied minor children. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=370.46s)]
*  The motion goes on to say that he could be sentenced for up to 10 years. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=372.58s)]
*  Again, they're stating these things as facts, Andre, but they're not there. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=376.74s)]
*  Where you prove these things are in court. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=381.22s)]
*  And so the indictment, how this usually works, you get an indictment, you lay it out in the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=383.22s)]
*  indictment, and then if the Department of Justice has a press conference, they are reiterating [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=386.54s)]
*  what's in their indictment, not bringing in new information like we saw from Ms. Bondy [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=390.3s)]
*  and her friends today. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=395.42s)]
*  But due process is important, and it seems as though Kilmar Abrego-Garcia is not going [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=397.90000000000003s)]
*  to get that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=403.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=404.7s)]
*  What has happened to him is incredibly unfair. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=406.42s)]
*  First of all, he was wrongfully deported by the US government, sent to a terrorism confinement [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=408.22s)]
*  center. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=411.9s)]
*  You know, he had the president of El Salvador saying that he was never really asked to return [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=412.9s)]
*  Mr. Abrego-Garcia. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=417.82s)]
*  At least now he will be in the United States, he will be represented by lawyers and be going [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=419.34s)]
*  through our normal justice system. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=423.65999999999997s)]
*  He's been going through an extra legal system this whole time. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=425.9s)]
*  And hopefully that will allow him to present the actual facts of his time in the United [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=429.82s)]
*  States. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=433.78s)]
*  We don't even know the facts. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=434.78s)]
*  They've used the entire, you know how monumental this is, they've used the entire platform [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=435.78s)]
*  of the White House to tell his story before he was even on US soil to defend himself. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=439.70000000000005s)]
*  That's very significant. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=444.62s)]
*  And it's just eroding such trust in the government in terms of the DOJ and in terms of our immigration [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=445.70000000000005s)]
*  system. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=450.38000000000005s)]
*  How are Americans supposed to have trust in our immigration processes when they say you [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=451.38000000000005s)]
*  cannot bring back somebody wrongfully deported and then they brought him back months later? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=455.5s)]
*  And so what's real and what is not real in their mass deportation campaign, everybody [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=459.58000000000004s)]
*  should be looking behind the scenes now because they're showing in their goal of getting as [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=465.12s)]
*  many people out as possible. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=470.36s)]
*  It's similar to DOJ, right? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=472.2s)]
*  They're breaking everything even in the immigration system. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=473.36s)]
*  And now they're bringing people back and saying, wait a minute, now we want to deport them [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=476.04s)]
*  again another way. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=478.64s)]
*  That's not how the law works. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  It's not how it should work. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=481.48s)]
*  And I think the public is really focused on this case. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=482.48s)]
*  And I think Democratic leaders have to keep pointing out it's about all of our due process. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=484.88s)]
*  I will say yes. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=488.84000000000003s)]
*  That is the point because the administration wants us to make this about Kim Arbor Garcia's [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=490.48s)]
*  alleged criminal past. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=496.16s)]
*  This is about the rights due process. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=498.36s)]
*  If he goes through the due process and it comes out on the other side and a jury and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=502.36s)]
*  a judge say he did something, that's the process. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=506.64s)]
*  The process is not Stephen Miller and his little minions yelling at the ICE department. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=509.8s)]
*  Well there are other officials here that I want to make sure that we highlight and we [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=515.24s)]
*  had teased some breaking news and I want to make sure we get to it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=519.0s)]
*  Lisa Ben Schrader, the chief of the criminal division of the Middle District of Tennessee [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=522.24s)]
*  where this indictment was filed resigned around the time it was entered under seal. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=525.8s)]
*  This is something from one of his announcements earlier today. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=531.04s)]
*  After nearly 15 years as an assistant United States attorney, I resigned as chief of the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=533.44s)]
*  criminal division at the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=538.0s)]
*  It's been an incredible privilege to serve as a prosecutor with the Department of Justice. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=541.96s)]
*  Where the only job description I've ever known is to do the right thing in the right [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=546.2s)]
*  way for the right reasons. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=550.76s)]
*  Coincidence? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=553.24s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=554.24s)]
*  There are other outlets tonight reporting that they have sources telling them definitively [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=556.0s)]
*  that Ben Schrader resigned because of this case. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=560.84s)]
*  And it's not just around the same time. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=564.44s)]
*  I want to put a finer point on it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=566.2s)]
*  Ben Schrader's post came on May 21st where he said earlier today I resigned. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=568.6s)]
*  May 21st is the date stamped right on that Abrego Garcia indictment. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=573.28s)]
*  It was only today that it was unsealed to the public. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=576.9599999999999s)]
*  But he was indicted on the same day that Ben Schrader resigned. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=580.16s)]
*  Telling the public that the only job description you've ever known and I'm reading from it [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=584.3199999999999s)]
*  is to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons and not explaining why [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=588.26s)]
*  you've resigned. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=593.28s)]
*  Not telling anybody what job you have next. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=594.88s)]
*  And indeed I've been on Ben Schrader's LinkedIn page. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=597.36s)]
*  He does not have according to his LinkedIn page. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=600.1999999999999s)]
*  A new place of employment. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=602.84s)]
*  That suggests to me, obviously we can't definitively say, that suggests to me that this is not [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=604.72s)]
*  coincidence. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=609.9200000000001s)]
*  And I hope that people will continue to report on whether he and others of his colleagues [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=610.9200000000001s)]
*  objected to the objectives of the Department of Justice in trying to deport first and prosecute [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=615.32s)]
*  later. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=621.88s)]
*  That's not how it's supposed to work. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGh5Zowrdg&t=622.88s)]
