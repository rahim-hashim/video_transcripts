# 'Data can be weaponized': Ronan Farrow sounds alarm on DOGE access to private Social Security data
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY)
*  But despite Trump and Musk's blowup, this ruling tonight makes clear that we are still [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=0.0s)]
*  living with the consequences of Musk's time in the administration, and we could be for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=4.96s)]
*  some time, which is why we need to keep focusing on it and talking about it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=9.84s)]
*  I mean, remember, Elon Musk is a man with a vendetta, even more so now, a man in open [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=13.72s)]
*  warfare with the president of the United States. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=18.92s)]
*  And now Hishdo's staff has obtained access to the most sensitive personal data of millions [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=21.76s)]
*  of Americans. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=27.04s)]
*  I mean, when that 24-year-old former SpaceX intern is combing through the sensitive data, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=28.68s)]
*  which he may be now, maybe next week, who does he think he's working for? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=32.8s)]
*  The federal government or his old boss, Elon Musk? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  I honestly don't know the answer to that question. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  And that is a very frightening place to be. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=44.04s)]
*  Here's another question. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  What protections do we have that this data is not going to wind up being fed into Elon [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=48.08s)]
*  Musk's AI program? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=52.36s)]
*  I mean, that's a real concern that one former government official testified about in this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  case, saying, quote, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=58.52s)]
*  The truth is that Elon Musk and his companies were already significantly enmeshed in the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=74.64s)]
*  federal government before Trump took over. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=78.88s)]
*  Now Trump has given Musk and his minions extraordinary new access to even broader swaths of the government. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=81.52s)]
*  And as their feud escalates, Musk may have fewer and fewer reasons to tread carefully [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  at all. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  The New Yorker's Ronan Farrow has been covering the problematic relationship, that's one way [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  of putting it, between Musk's business empire and our federal government for years. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=96.88s)]
*  I mean, back in 2023, long before Musk had even endorsed Trump, Ronan Farrow published [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=101.0s)]
*  a detailed report on this very topic. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=106.16s)]
*  And he's been pushing the public to view Musk's rise through that exact lens ever since. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=108.96s)]
*  In my view, the real story here isn't just about Musk. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=115.63999999999999s)]
*  It's about a model of power that's facilitated his rise and how public institutions are increasingly [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=119.1s)]
*  being replaced by private individuals operating without accountability. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=125.0s)]
*  It's about why we've built a system where someone like him effectively substitutes for [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=130.0s)]
*  the state without the checks that generally come with public power. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=135.12s)]
*  Joining me now is Ronan Farrow. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=142.12s)]
*  He's an investigative reporter for The New Yorker. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=143.36s)]
*  He's reported extensively on Elon Musk's rise to power. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=145.52s)]
*  He's also reported extensively about how data can be weaponized against American citizens. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=149.04s)]
*  Ronan, I reread your 2023 piece this morning, and there is so much in there that it includes [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=153.76s)]
*  warning signs, it includes really a better understanding that I think is important for [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=161.62s)]
*  almost anybody trying to digest this moment. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=165.62s)]
*  I want to talk to you all about that, but I also wanted to start by asking you about [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=167.26000000000002s)]
*  this Supreme Court ruling that happened just this afternoon. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=172.06s)]
*  It's going to allow Doge unfettered access to data at the Social Security Administration. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=175.58s)]
*  As I mentioned, you've also done a lot of reporting on the weaponization of data. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  Where does your mind go first on what that means? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, you make exactly the right point. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=188.74s)]
*  Data can be weaponized. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=191.98s)]
*  There is a reason why privacy law exists, why this is a really important body of cases [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=193.78s)]
*  that the Supreme Court has ruled on over the years, and why we've seen internationally [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=200.74s)]
*  when you aggregate data and you put it into hands with little oversight, it can and very [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=204.66s)]
*  often will be abused. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=210.26s)]
*  I mean, I've reported on that in many places around the world. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=211.26s)]
*  But just to take an example of a current superpower, we've seen how China has centralized data [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=215.34s)]
*  in an unrestricted way and used that to create a surveillance apparatus that really has been [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=220.88s)]
*  used to target ethnic minorities. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=226.64s)]
*  You can take this kind of personal data, which includes health details, mental health details, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=229.5s)]
*  financial details, and you can use it to target people, to come after people, to categorize [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=235.08s)]
*  people and take action against them, deny them rights. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=240.64s)]
*  So this is serious stuff, and that's why you see the minority in the court today really [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=243.94s)]
*  sounding alarm about this. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=248.74s)]
*  You know, Justice Jackson saying the court has lost its way. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=250.62s)]
*  This is something that privacy proponents are going to be talking about for a very long [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=254.78s)]
*  time. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=259.58s)]
*  Then you come to the hands we're putting it in. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=260.58s)]
*  Doge. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=262.42s)]
*  This is an unproven ad hoc organization. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=263.42s)]
*  There are still unanswered questions about its legal status. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=266.74s)]
*  There's not a lot by way of congressional oversight or restrictions. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=270.02000000000004s)]
*  There are a lot of questions about its staff. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=274.58000000000004s)]
*  A lot of the Doge staff is hired under the same status Elon Musk was hired under as special [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=277.14000000000004s)]
*  government employees, basically meaning they could fast track the hiring of really young, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=282.42s)]
*  really inexperienced people. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  This opens up a whole lot of risks and vulnerabilities, which we can get into. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=288.88s)]
*  No question about it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=294.36s)]
*  We just talked about some of that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=295.48s)]
*  One of the goals of Doge has always been to scoop up data. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=297.82s)]
*  They haven't made any secret of that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=301.94s)]
*  I spoke with someone recently who used to work in the IRS who said someone from Doge [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=303.94s)]
*  told her in a meeting that data is the mission, that getting data is the mission. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=308.34s)]
*  You're an excellent investigative reporter. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=313.65999999999997s)]
*  You've mentioned some of the things that you want more information on, but what are you [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=316.21999999999997s)]
*  going to be watching? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=320.34s)]
*  Or what are some of the questions that you think people should be asking about this access [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=321.34s)]
*  and what they could be doing with it? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  The point you made that data is the mission is a really important one for all of us to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  sit with just as citizens concerned about all of our safety and freedom. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=335.48s)]
*  Silicon Valley has showed us that time and time again they are on a mission to aggregate [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=340.16s)]
*  data about human beings in order to manipulate and monetize human behavior. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=344.88s)]
*  We are coming to a reckoning about how social media platforms did that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=350.04s)]
*  We are still to come to a reckoning about how AI companies will do that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=353.76s)]
*  Elon Musk and his stake and roll in Doge connects directly to Elon Musk's stake and roll in [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=357.84s)]
*  Grok through his company XAI. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=364.64s)]
*  There is evidence, we don't have a lot of transparency on this, we don't have all the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=367.53999999999996s)]
*  answers, but there is evidence that he is feeding a lot of this sensitive data into [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=370.76s)]
*  his own AI products, using them to train his own AI products. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=375.02s)]
*  We don't know how much of that data may be exiting with him, may show up in his systems [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=379.0s)]
*  in years to come, which are systems that accord to his private interests, which are very different [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=384.14s)]
*  from the interests of the American people. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=390.4s)]
*  No question about it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=393.28s)]
*  And all those questions about where that data could be and go with some of these Doge officials [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=394.28s)]
*  still in the government is a huge, huge, huge one. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=398.04s)]
*  You did, I mentioned I reread this extensive profile, everybody on our team reread it today. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=402.24s)]
*  It's basically about how entangled Musk had become at that point in time with the national [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=407.92s)]
*  security apparatus of the United States, in some ways how powerful he had become. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=412.54s)]
*  I mean, obviously that entanglement has only grown deeper in many, many ways. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=416.68s)]
*  I mean, and yesterday Musk threatened to decommission the spacecraft that brought back two stranded [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=422.48s)]
*  astronauts. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=427.04s)]
*  I'm unclear where that sits at this point, but that was a threat. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=428.04s)]
*  Knowing and following and investigating and reporting on him as much as you have, if he [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=431.48s)]
*  really wanted to make things painful for Trump and really more importantly for the American [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=436.41999999999996s)]
*  people, given all of his companies and entanglements, what else could he do? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=440.61999999999995s)]
*  There is a bigger picture here, which is part of what I was writing about of waning government [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=447.26s)]
*  power and of rising private power. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=451.9s)]
*  There are a lot of economic and political factors that have led up to this point, but [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=455.26s)]
*  we are in a state now where there are key services that once would have been a guarantee [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=459.02s)]
*  from the state that are in the hands of private, unaccountable billionaires and private unaccountable [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=463.5s)]
*  companies that they run. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=470.21999999999997s)]
*  You mentioned the threat to decommission the Dragoncraft. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=471.84s)]
*  That is the only way we have to ferry astronauts from the International Space Station back [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=476.06s)]
*  to Earth. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=482.09999999999997s)]
*  There is literally a possibility that if he were to actually do that, and it does seem [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=483.21999999999997s)]
*  like someone tweeted at him and said, maybe not, and he said, okay, okay, fine, I won't. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=486.74s)]
*  This is the threshold for decision making about something that could literally leave [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=492.54s)]
*  human beings stranded and facing death. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=496.02000000000004s)]
*  And we haven't built in redundancy. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=500.18s)]
*  And what government officials were telling me even a couple of years ago was, hey, we're [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN05ecUduGY&t=502.1s)]
