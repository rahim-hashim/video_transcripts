# BREAKING: Freed Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander returns to Israel
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ)
*  We are coming back to you live with the news that many people have been waiting for for 548 days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=0.0s)]
*  There is a convoy heading into the airbase in Israel as we wait for our first sign of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=7.2s)]
*  Iran Alexander, the U.S. citizen who had been held hostage in Gaza. He was released today by Hamas. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=13.76s)]
*  He is obviously we are told back in Israeli territory. He was handed over just a short time ago [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=23.68s)]
*  from the Red Cross to the IDF and obviously there is a tremendous homecoming that is waiting for [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  him. Members of his family waiting and people watching as well in his hometown in New Jersey. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=40.16s)]
*  There are helicopters on the ground presumably awaiting him to take him to Tel Aviv. Let me take [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=48.24s)]
*  it to NBC's Hala Gharani. Hala, it seems like we could be very close now to this exceptional moment. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Absolutely, Chris. His family will be relieved that he has made it out of Gaza. He was handed over to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  the Red Cross inside of the Gaza Strip, then driven out and handed to IDF forces, the Israeli [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=72.64s)]
*  military and that is the convoy that you see driving toward a military base called Reim in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=80.4s)]
*  southern Israel. That is where he will be reunited with his mother, his father and other members of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=86.16s)]
*  his family. There were photos that were put out by the Israeli authorities showing his mother [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=91.52s)]
*  preparing his clothing on a bed in what we believe is Reim Air Base or military base, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=97.44s)]
*  I should say. After 584 days in captivity, he turned 20 and then 21 in Hamas detention [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=104.72s)]
*  and captivity. The deal that led to his release was very unusual in the sense that it didn't [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=112.16s)]
*  involve the Israeli government. It was struck between the Trump administration and Hamas [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=118.56s)]
*  directly bypassing the Israeli prime minister. Again, what you're seeing there on your screens [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=125.36s)]
*  are vehicles, one of which is transporting Edan Alexander. He'll be taken to that military base. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=131.68s)]
*  He'll be assessed medically and then he will be choppered, we presume, along with his family [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=139.12s)]
*  to Ikhilov Hospital in Tel Aviv, not far from our position here. We hope that we'll be able to see [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=144.88s)]
*  either video or at least still images of his reunion with his mother. She's been interviewed [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=151.84s)]
*  over the last year and a half plus by NBC. I've interviewed her twice myself. She always tried [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=157.36s)]
*  to send a message to her son telling him to stay strong, that they were going to meet up. He was [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=166.4s)]
*  due to be released, in fact, Chris, March 1st. That's when phase two of the latest ceasefire [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=171.52s)]
*  deal was meant to begin. But then, of course, the ceasefire collapsed. The Israeli prime minister, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=177.52s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, restarted the war in the Gaza Strip and that led to the cancellation, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=184.16000000000003s)]
*  the postponement until today, of the release of Edan Alexander, Chris. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=190.4s)]
*  All right, stand by for us. Let's look at the beginning of this convoy that we believe is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=195.36s)]
*  holding Edan Alexander, 21 years old, born in Israel, but his parents moved to the U.S. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=200.8s)]
*  when he was very young. He was raised in New Jersey and he decided to wait to go to college [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=206.72s)]
*  and instead joined the Israeli Defense Forces, IDF. He was patrolling on a kibbutz near Gaza [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=211.84s)]
*  on October 7th when Hamas attacked. We've learned a lot about him. His family says he was an avid [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=218.8s)]
*  sports fan, loyal, great sense of humor. He, again, was previously expected to be released in March, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=224.96s)]
*  but Hamas later said it had lost contact with the group holding him. Well, after unusual [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=232.96s)]
*  negotiations directly between the United States and Hamas, he appears to be just minutes potentially [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  away from being reunited with his family. I want to go to Christopher O'Leary, former Director of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=248.08s)]
*  Hostage Recovery for the U.S. Government, Senior Vice President of Global Operations at the Sufan [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=254.8s)]
*  Group. I don't even, none of us can imagine what this must be like. There must be a point early on [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=259.68s)]
*  in the process, Christopher, when you maybe don't even let yourself believe what might be happening [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  and then he's handed over to the IDF and we should say that the commanders and soldiers of the IDF [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=274.8s)]
*  are celebrating today as well as we look at what's going on at military base. What are these minutes [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  like and the time leading up to it? Well, you don't know that the deal is done until he is in your [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=287.28s)]
*  custody, in your care. You know, just like what happened back in March, these things can fall [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  apart at the last minute. You're dealing with a terrorist organization who are the individuals [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  you're negotiating with for the release, claiming that they lost contact with the component that was [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  holding them. So you don't know if that's true. You don't know if it's not. But until he was brought [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=315.12s)]
*  into the Red Cross's care and then turned over to the IDF, you really don't know if this is going [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=320.0s)]
*  to go through. But what does happen is all the planning to try to reintegrate the hostage and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=325.68s)]
*  get them back to full health and, you know, they're meant to well-being the entire time. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=332.8s)]
*  Other things that are being prepared, which are really not talked about as much, he will be debriefed [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=339.12s)]
*  by Israeli intelligence and military intelligence for tactical information that might lead to the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=344.48s)]
*  location of other hostages, the identification of their guards. But then at some point down the line, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=351.44s)]
*  he's also going to be interviewed by FBI agents because he is a victim of a crime, number one. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=358.72s)]
*  Number two, he's also the witness of crimes against other U.S. victims. So if the FBI ever [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=365.92s)]
*  needs to pursue members of Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad for their crimes, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=373.28s)]
*  his statements will be critical to building that case. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=379.52s)]
*  We are set on a shot in Tel Aviv, Israel, where he will be heading via helicopter. And [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=382.79999999999995s)]
*  this has been such a long, long, long wait. And Chris, you said you know the parents. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=388.96s)]
*  I've interviewed any number of the hostage family members. And it is astonishing to me how they get [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=397.04s)]
*  up every day and put one foot in front of the other. And they don't just do that. We've watched [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=404.88s)]
*  family after family after family, including the Alexanders, advocate every day, going on TV, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  getting the word out when interest seemed to wane, trying to put that attention back on [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=421.12s)]
*  pressuring members of Congress, trying to put pressure on the Israeli government. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=427.68s)]
*  Having worked with them, how do they do it? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=432.16s)]
*  Well, the Alexanders, they're incredible people, but they are a typical hostage family. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=436.72s)]
*  They're, you know, what they endured is as devastating as what their son endured in many [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=444.64000000000004s)]
*  ways. You know, their son, his confines are terrible, but, you know, it's the conditions [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=451.12s)]
*  are somewhat set every day. You know, and he's, he'll become institutionalized. For the parents, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=458.88s)]
*  it's the unknown. They don't know what's happening, and they have little control over things. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  But the Alexanders and many of the other parents in this current saga with Israel, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=470.56s)]
*  they've been committed to trying to get in front of the White House and other key decision makers [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=477.76s)]
*  in the United States, travel back over to Israel, do the same thing there, get to Qatar, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=483.76s)]
*  because they know the Qataris are invested in this as well. And I don't know if they've slept for a [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=488.55999999999995s)]
*  year and a half. But as I talked about earlier, the Alexanders have done this with real grace [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=493.68s)]
*  the entire time, and I don't know how they've stayed so composed, because it would be the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  undoing of most people. So I'm just getting word, Christopher, that Adon Alexander has indeed [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=505.36s)]
*  arrived at the air base. So he will immediately go in with medical officials who are accompanying [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=516.48s)]
*  him right now and undergo an initial medical assessment and then be reunited with his family. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=525.52s)]
*  It was, it gave me chills to hear about his mother laying out his clothes that are waiting for him [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=532.0s)]
*  when he gets there. But when you talk about the other more formal things that will happen to him [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=539.44s)]
*  after that initial excitement, including the debriefing by the IDF, the conversations that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=545.28s)]
*  the FBI will want to have, how much training would he have had as a member of Israeli Defense Forces [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  to deal with a situation like this and the kind of information that he might have been able to [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=557.6s)]
*  collect even under these most extreme and unimaginable conditions? Well, I think it's [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  important to remember he's an IDF soldier, right? So, you know, many in the U.S. just point back to [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  the fact that, you know, just two years ago he was a high school student and a kid. He's no longer a [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=575.12s)]
*  kid. He's a soldier in one of the most competent militaries in the world. And he's had a certain [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  level of training, even though he was very junior, to be able to stay composed in very difficult [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=586.56s)]
*  situations. And his ability to endure and survive this is only, you know, indicative of the fact [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=593.12s)]
*  that he has the mental and physical capacity to do things that many others can't. So, you know, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=600.0s)]
*  he will certainly have been collecting information on who his guards are, maybe what units the guards [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=607.2s)]
*  are part of, conversations they've had, locations he's been moved to. And frankly, because that is [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=614.08s)]
*  his daily routine. And every soldier or Marine or sailor or airman or woman gets training in these [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=620.72s)]
*  kinds of things, certainly in the United States, but in the IDF as well. So he's been conditioned [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=628.32s)]
*  to collect some of these things. But even if he was just an average citizen, he's a witness to [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  things. And with the right people debriefing him, you can elicit information out of those conversations. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=640.32s)]
*  But it won't be a normal debriefing, at least the way we do it in the United States. We will have a [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=648.08s)]
*  victim advocate with him to help guide those conversations and to make sure he's psychologically [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=652.72s)]
*  prepared to go back through some of these difficult journeys. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JouSamvMTIQ&t=658.5600000000001s)]
