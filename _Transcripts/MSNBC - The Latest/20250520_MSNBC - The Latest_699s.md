# Border czar Homan: Rep. McIver was ‘out of line’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg)
*  Democratic Congresswoman Monica McIver is leveling some charges of her own today, saying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=0.0s)]
*  that the two counts against her of assaulting law enforcement are just pure politics. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=5.22s)]
*  These charges stem from a confrontation earlier this month involving Democratic members of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=11.28s)]
*  Congress at an ICE detention facility. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=15.44s)]
*  Here's what she said earlier today. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=18.32s)]
*  It's super unfortunate, Kate, that we have come to this point in America that this is [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=21.6s)]
*  what we see happening to leaders who are trying to do their jobs. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=26.52s)]
*  Rather, it's the mayor of the largest city. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=30.28s)]
*  Rather, it's a judge. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=32.8s)]
*  We've seen this administration come after and attack leaders for doing their jobs. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=34.6s)]
*  It's political intimidation, and I will not be intimidated. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  Joining us now is Tom Homan, border czar for the Trump administration. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=47.92s)]
*  You just heard the congresswoman. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  She says she was there to do her job, congressional oversight, and that these charges amount to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  political intimidation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=55.48s)]
*  In a statement, she also said it was ICE agents who created an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=57.3s)]
*  Do you believe that they could have unnecessarily escalated the situation, given that members [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=64.72s)]
*  of Congress have a right to be there and to go in? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=69.46s)]
*  Well, look, they have a right to be there for oversight, but there's a proper way to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=72.16s)]
*  do it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=76.64s)]
*  Forcing your way in the facility, putting hands on an ICE officer is not the way to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=77.64s)]
*  do it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  So I think she was out of line. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  I've seen the videotape. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=83.88s)]
*  I've seen six or seven different videotapes that show her acting unprofessionally. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=85.28s)]
*  These are the same people who, for four years, are saying President Trump wasn't above the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=89.44s)]
*  law. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, either is she. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  There's a line you can't cross, and I think she crossed it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  Now, I'll leave it up to Alina Habba, the prosecutor who's handling this case, to prove [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=97.52s)]
*  the case, but the video makes it clear to me that she wasn't being professional that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=104.96s)]
*  day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=109.12s)]
*  She certainly didn't act like a member of Congress. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=110.12s)]
*  She certainly could have requested a tour. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=112.2s)]
*  They give tours all the time, and if she got the tour, and many people have had the tour [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=114.2s)]
*  since, they've seen a grade A facility, the highest attention standards in the industry, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=117.48s)]
*  that puts to shame any facility, county or state, that New Jersey has. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  So I think it was politics over public safety. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=126.84s)]
*  That's a facility where the worse of the worse of howls, we can't lose control of that facility. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=131.88s)]
*  But her actions caused a ruckus at that facility, makes that facility unsafe. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=135.96s)]
*  And she caused the ruckus, though, because you acknowledge that she has the right to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=140.84s)]
*  be there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=144.68s)]
*  You put out the administration put out a document back in February saying members of Congress [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=145.68s)]
*  will be allowed to go in. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=152.04s)]
*  They were told they were set. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=153.56s)]
*  They said that they had to wait for hours. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=155.28s)]
*  And I want to ask you about the word that you've very carefully used, which is unprofessional. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=158.36s)]
*  Even if you believe she was unprofessional, did you see something in that tape that suggested [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=163.24s)]
*  she was criminal? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=169.12s)]
*  Is there a tape that we haven't seen because the charging documents suggest that she somehow [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  assaulted two of the ICE agents there? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=175.2s)]
*  I did not see that in that tape. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=178.56s)]
*  Well, I've seen tapes where she has made body contact with ICE officers and pushing them. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of tapes out there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=186.6s)]
*  I mean, there's numerous tapes. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=189.16s)]
*  In a scuffle, is it normal that people would make body contact, though, Mr. Holman? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=190.16s)]
*  As you say, she has a right to do oversight, but there's a right way to do it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=194.76s)]
*  Forcing yourself, two officers, to get in that facility is not the way to do it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  We have many Congressmen that visit our facilities. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=204.84s)]
*  What she did was unprofessional. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=207.32s)]
*  Do you believe that she was a threat? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=209.92s)]
*  I believe she caused the facility to be unsafe. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=212.72s)]
*  When an ICE officer being pulled off their duties to deal with a member of Congress who [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=215.32s)]
*  is forced away in the facility and puts her hands on an ICE officer is unprofessional. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=218.88s)]
*  I think she crossed the line. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=225.76s)]
*  Again, I'm not the prosecutor. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=227.2s)]
*  I don't have to prove it in court, but the video I saw shows her at fault. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=228.72s)]
*  If she was in some way dangerous, if she caused the facility to be unsafe, why would they [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=233.12s)]
*  ultimately let her in? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=237.92s)]
*  They didn't allow her in. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=240.0s)]
*  If in that moment she forced her way in, then they dealt with it from then on. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=243.72s)]
*  Look, and this is the same week where we're here in D.C. honoring the men and women of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=249.6s)]
*  law enforcement who made the ultimate sacrifice. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=254.48s)]
*  I went to Borvich from Amarillo. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=256.88s)]
*  I just want to clarify something. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=259.0s)]
*  You said she did go in Mr. Hohmann. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=260.0s)]
*  She did go in. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=262.8s)]
*  The same week we honored the men and women of law enforcement, she's out there putting [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=263.8s)]
*  her hands on them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  So she's being held accountable. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  She should be held. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=270.64s)]
*  But you acknowledge she did go into the facility. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=272.04s)]
*  So why would she be let in if she was a danger? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=275.32s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm just telling you what I've learned through my sources and from the videotapes I saw that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  she forced away in the facility. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=285.18s)]
*  There's a difference between oversight responsibility, arranging her eyes to go to a safe and secure [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=287.08s)]
*  tour of a facility where criminals are locked up, criminals are walking the hallways, and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=294.0s)]
*  forcing her away in the facility. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=299.2s)]
*  It should have been done more professionally. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  And I'll let the courts decide if she's in violation of law. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  But the videos I saw, she could have been held a lot more professional on that day. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=306.76s)]
*  And you believe the ICE agents were professional? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=311.96s)]
*  I believe so, yes. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=315.36s)]
*  Let me ask you about, I don't know how much you heard of my question. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=317.08000000000004s)]
*  Big picture, a Georgia college student was mistakenly, the officers involved acknowledged [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=320.44s)]
*  they mistakenly pulled her over. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=326.16s)]
*  She's being detained right now. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=328.48s)]
*  Her father said he was never worried about her. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=330.6s)]
*  She came over here at four, never been in any trouble. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=333.44s)]
*  She's a college student. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=335.98s)]
*  Because you had said you would prioritize gang members, rapists, and criminals. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=337.72s)]
*  She obviously is none of those things. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=342.32000000000005s)]
*  Has that changed? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=344.88s)]
*  Has that priority changed? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=345.92s)]
*  No, no. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=346.92s)]
*  What I have said is we won't prioritize public safety threats and national security threats, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=347.92s)]
*  and that's what we're doing. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=351.56s)]
*  But just because we prioritize something, somebody doesn't mean we walk away from illegal [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  handling. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=357.28s)]
*  If you're in the country illegally, I've said this a thousand times. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=358.28s)]
*  You're not off the table. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=360.2s)]
*  You're just not being prioritized. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=361.2s)]
*  I'm not familiar with this case. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=362.68s)]
*  I don't know if she has a criminal history. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=364.2s)]
*  I don't know if she's an overstay. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=365.6s)]
*  I don't know if she's here illegally. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=366.84s)]
*  I'm just not familiar with this case. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=368.44s)]
*  The Trump administration has spent millions of dollars on an ad campaign, an app, to get [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=371.32s)]
*  people to self-deport. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=376.32s)]
*  The first flight, I understand, carrying 64 of those migrants, that's an administration [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=377.76s)]
*  number, landed in Honduras yesterday and then the same flight, we're told, also took people [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=382.84s)]
*  to Colombia. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=387.84s)]
*  Do you have an update on how many people have signed up for the app? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=389.55999999999995s)]
*  What kind of numbers you expect in terms of self-deportation? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=393.28s)]
*  I guess bottom line, what can taxpayers expect for the millions of dollars spent on this? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=397.44s)]
*  Well, I think it was around, the last time I looked, I believe the number is around 7,500. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=402.08s)]
*  We expect that number to vastly increase the more we get information out. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=407.2s)]
*  But it's a cost savings for American taxpayers. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=410.08s)]
*  I mean, a removal proceedings is around 17,000. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=412.96s)]
*  These people are leaving with a thousand dollars. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=417.44s)]
*  It's going to save detention costs. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  It's going to save transportation costs. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=421.91999999999996s)]
*  It's going to save judicial costs, you know, through the whole immigration court proceeding. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  So I hope people take advantage of them because they can get their arrangements together, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=428.56s)]
*  whatever arrangements they have to do with their families and their possessions, to go [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=432.36s)]
*  to their country and give themselves an opportunity to come back, either as a visitor, a tourist, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=436.24s)]
*  or, you know, come as a student on a visa, or if they have a U.S. citizen child, a U.S. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=441.88s)]
*  citizen child can petition for them to come in as a parent of a U.S. citizen. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=446.04s)]
*  It leaves them open to legal pathways because if we have to go through the process of locating [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=450.84000000000003s)]
*  them, having a formal order deportation issued by a federal judge, and finding them and actually [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=456.0s)]
*  putting their hands in deporting them, that locks them out from a lot of programs in the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=461.36s)]
*  future. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=465.48s)]
*  There's a bar placed against them for up to 20 years. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=466.48s)]
*  Some bars are permanent. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=469.0s)]
*  So leave on their own. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=470.12s)]
*  If they're in the country, we need to do the right thing because there are millions of [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=471.40000000000003s)]
*  people standing in line right now, taking their tests, doing their background investigations, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=474.32s)]
*  paying the fees to be a part of the greatest nation on earth, and they're sitting in the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=478.68s)]
*  backseat while we're dealing with over 10 million illegal aliens coming across the border [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=481.76s)]
*  in the last administration. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=485.08s)]
*  So we're asking people, do the right thing. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=486.56s)]
*  You're in the country lawfully. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=487.88s)]
*  Actually, the country, illegal is a crime. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=488.88s)]
*  Go home and make it right and make yourself eligible for legal programs. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=491.52s)]
*  Can I just make sure I understand, because I know it was only 64 on that one flight, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=495.88s)]
*  but are you saying that that 7,500 number is all self-deported folks? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=500.44s)]
*  Yeah, we've got a lot of self-deportation that aren't going to the normal process. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=506.35999999999996s)]
*  The CBP-1 app is one, but a lot of people are self-deporting and showing up to the Mexican [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=513.1999999999999s)]
*  port of entries. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=519.84s)]
*  We know that it's hard to capture a true number. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=521.48s)]
*  The last number I saw was about 7,500 total. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=525.04s)]
*  The CBP-1 app, I think we're around, I looked at 3,000 have applied just the last couple [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=527.92s)]
*  weeks, so the number changes every day. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=534.8399999999999s)]
*  But it's hard to track the exact number, because a lot of people self-deport on their own [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=536.8399999999999s)]
*  and don't make a report. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=540.3599999999999s)]
*  I wish they would, because it helps us track them and understand that they've left the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=541.3599999999999s)]
*  country so they can qualify for another program. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=544.64s)]
*  A lot of undocumented immigrants have said that they don't feel safe signing up for the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=548.8399999999999s)]
*  app because they're giving their information to the government. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=553.04s)]
*  Can you assure people who sign up for that app that they won't be arrested before they [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=556.2399999999999s)]
*  self-deport, that there's no danger in signing up for that app? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=560.76s)]
*  Of course, that's the whole reason we wanted to get the affairs together and leave. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=564.88s)]
*  We won't arrest them unless we realize there's a significant public safety threat or significant [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=568.8s)]
*  national security threat. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=574.12s)]
*  We can't allow them to stay here. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=575.12s)]
*  We have to go find them and get them out as quick as we can. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=576.12s)]
*  But the whole justification for this program, leave on your own, get your affairs together, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=578.52s)]
*  whether it's family, whether it's family members, whether it's property, get your [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=584.9599999999999s)]
*  affairs together, and let's do this the most humane way we can. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=588.0s)]
*  I also want to finally ask you about one more video. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=591.6s)]
*  We looked at the congressman's video, but there is a new video from that high-profile [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=594.6800000000001s)]
*  case. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=598.1800000000001s)]
*  This was released by Mahmoud Khalil's lawyers. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=599.1800000000001s)]
*  It shows the moments leading up to the Colombian graduate student's arrest. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=601.74s)]
*  The government had claimed he wouldn't cooperate. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=605.96s)]
*  They believed he was going to leave the scene. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=607.98s)]
*  This video, we see him talking to them, laughing. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=610.32s)]
*  They were handing the phone back and forth. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=613.5600000000001s)]
*  He was talking to his lawyer. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=615.46s)]
*  The agents were talking to his lawyer. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=616.8000000000001s)]
*  And then his wife even went and brought his green card, which he handed over. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=619.22s)]
*  So is there something we're not seeing? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=623.94s)]
*  What is the justification for saying that he was not being cooperative and they thought [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=626.1s)]
*  he was going to flee? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=630.3000000000001s)]
*  Again, I'm not familiar with the intricacies of that investigation. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=631.7s)]
*  I know that the State Department worked with ICE to solidify that they considered him a [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=636.54s)]
*  support of a terrorist organization, enemy of this country. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=642.78s)]
*  It's not just what he said. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=646.5s)]
*  It's actions he took, taking over a college building, taking over a college property, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=647.66s)]
*  damaging college property, holding people against your will, threatening Jewish students. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=651.58s)]
*  None of that's OK. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=656.7800000000001s)]
*  It's a great privilege to come to this country on a visa or a green card. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=657.7800000000001s)]
*  You've got to follow the rules. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=661.38s)]
*  Don't follow the rules. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=662.38s)]
*  You're going to be deported. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=663.38s)]
*  And I think the State Department made that decision to revoke his status, which means [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=664.38s)]
*  he's now illegal in the United States. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=667.74s)]
*  He has to be removed. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=669.1s)]
*  And we should say his family and his lawyers disagree with that characterization of what [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=670.46s)]
*  he did. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=674.46s)]
*  But Tom Homan, you've given us a lot of time and I do appreciate it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=675.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Y61rdLkGg&t=678.58s)]
