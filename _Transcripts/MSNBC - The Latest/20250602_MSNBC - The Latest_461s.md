# Like 'person in our family' has gone missing: Missouri town rally behind mother facing deportation
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk)
*  Welcome back. We are taking a closer look at the impact of President Trump's sweeping [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=0.0s)]
*  immigration crackdown as one of Missouri's, one town in Missouri that is fights for the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=4.08s)]
*  release of a beloved community member who's now facing deportation. Carol Hui was called [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=9.36s)]
*  Kennet, Missouri home for two decades. In that time, she became a well-known member [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=15.6s)]
*  of this small rural community serving breakfast at a local diner, regularly attending Sunday [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=21.38s)]
*  mass with her partner and their three children. But as the New York Times writes, quote, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=26.04s)]
*  all that ended on April 30th when federal immigration officials summoned Carol, 45, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  whose legal name is Ming-Li Hui to their office in St. Louis, a three-hour drive from Kennet. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=36.8s)]
*  She was arrested in jail to await deportation. Joining us now is Lisa Dry, a city council [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=43.28s)]
*  member from Kennet, Missouri, where Carol lived for over 20 years. Lisa, thank you for [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=49.84s)]
*  taking the time. We see that shirt you were wearing there. It says, bring Carol home. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=55.2s)]
*  You wear it proudly. As someone who knows Carol personally, who is she to your community? What [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=60.720000000000006s)]
*  should people know about her? Well, Anna, first of all, thank you for having me on the show to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=65.84s)]
*  talk about Carol, because what we want people to know is that Carol is an amazing person, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=71.04s)]
*  but she's not the only one in this situation. And I think people in the town have come to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  learn that. Carol, I've known for her for about five years since I moved back here. Kennet is a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=81.6s)]
*  small town, about 10,000 people. And if you dine at any restaurants, and we only have about a dozen, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  you will know Carol because she's worked in many of them. And John's Waffle and Pancake House, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  her current employer, is like the old cheers program. Everyone knows your name. You walk in, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  they say hi. Before I sit down, they have my diet Pepsi ready for me. And when you leave, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=106.4s)]
*  they say goodbye. And it's a very familiar kind of place. It's like your family. And so right now, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  it's like a really important person in our family has gone missing. And so you have the shirt. There [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=118.72s)]
*  have been these efforts, these fundraisers to try to bring support to that effort to bring her home, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  to help her children. What does that effort look like right now? It's really kind of an organic [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=129.36s)]
*  movement. It was nothing that's really organized. Initially, we did a lot of phone calls and emails [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=135.84s)]
*  to our congressional representatives, our two senators and our congressmen. The restaurant [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  owners organized a fundraiser for her on a day that they would normally be closed. They donated [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=148.08s)]
*  all the labor and all the sales to Carol's calls for her family and her attorney. They sold over [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=153.76s)]
*  $8,000 worth of food that day and received more than $12,000 in cash donations, which meant [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  more than $20,000 was raised for her. And people continue to drop off donations at the restaurant. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, that really speaks to the impact that she's had clearly and just the way that this community [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  is much like a family as you've described it. What went through your mind when you learned that she [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  had been detained? I was shocked. I was in my car out of town doing something when the local [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=184.0s)]
*  reporter called me about it and I just couldn't believe it. I thought, oh my gosh, we have to do [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=190.64s)]
*  something. And it's funny because I think on one of the MSNBC programs they had talked about, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=195.84s)]
*  you need to be prepared if this happens to someone in your community. And I just kind of like [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=200.8s)]
*  laughed that off, but then it happened here. And so, you know, we moved pretty quickly to start [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=205.2s)]
*  sharing her story and we've been fortunate that we've gotten quite a bit of national media [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=211.2s)]
*  attention. And I'm hoping that makes our very conservative Republican representatives [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=215.76s)]
*  take some action to bring Carol back to Kenneth where she belongs. The immigration crackdown was [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=223.44s)]
*  one of President Trump's signature campaign promises there in Duncan County. He won 80% [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=228.88s)]
*  of the vote in November. What kind of shock did Carol's story really send throughout your [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=234.72s)]
*  community? And has it changed any minds of those who have embraced Trump's deportation effort? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=240.4s)]
*  People were shocked. They were stunned. Their questions are, this must be a mistake. What [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=246.24s)]
*  happened? You know, there must be something more that we don't know about her. But as time has [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  passed over the past month, people realize, no, this is a policy. Will it change votes? That's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=258.16s)]
*  the million dollar question. I don't know, but I think it's causing some thoughtful people to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=264.72s)]
*  think more and question a bit. I ran into a longtime friend at the restaurant last week [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=269.92s)]
*  and she said, Lisa, I am so mad about what has happened to Carol. She said, I know I'm a [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=276.56s)]
*  conservative. She said, but this is making me want to lean the other way. And so I hope that same [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=282.32s)]
*  thought process is going through other people's minds to think a little bit more broadly about [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  what these policies mean. I know we all want to secure a border, but there also needs to be an [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=293.92s)]
*  immigration policy that allows a long time person in the community, immigrants like Carol, who've [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  been here 10, 15, 20 years to find a path to citizenship. And I'm also hopeful that people [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  will remember this next year during the midterm elections and then even beyond that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=312.0s)]
*  You talk about your friend who is maybe thinking twice about who she'll vote for. Have you talked [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  to anyone who regrets voting for president Trump after what's happened to Carol? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=325.2s)]
*  Not yet. I think it needs to just sink in a bit. This is, as you said, a very Republican area, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=331.52s)]
*  which was not the case 30 years ago, but it is now. Immigration was one of the issues that people [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=338.88s)]
*  voted on. The other was the economy and the social issues. This is really deep in the Bible belt. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=344.8s)]
*  And so some of the social and cultural issues that were swirling around the Republicans, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  call some people to go vote for president Trump. I just hope people, as we're living through these [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=356.88s)]
*  very extreme policies, will start to see that maybe there's a more moderate way to go and that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=364.0s)]
*  this isn't what they want. If you could send a message to the Trump administration about Carol, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=370.32s)]
*  what would it be? That Carol is the model citizen you want in every community. She's a woman who [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=376.32s)]
*  works one or two jobs, sometimes three by cleaning houses. She pays her taxes. She owns a home. And [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=382.8s)]
*  she has three beautiful young children who need their mom at home. She revels in their success. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=390.0s)]
*  They are honor students. They get citizenship awards at school. They play on all the sports team. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=396.88s)]
*  Carol being gone is just really a hole in our community. And she's not the only one. I'm sure [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=403.92s)]
*  there are perhaps even millions of others who've been caught up in these quotas and taken from [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=409.52000000000004s)]
*  their homes who belong as contributing members of their communities and need to be at home. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=415.12s)]
*  Lisa Dry, thank you so much for sharing about Carol with us and what your community is doing [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=422.24s)]
*  to rally around her and the impact that the immigration policies that we're seeing play out [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=428.8s)]
*  are having on at least your community. We really appreciate your time and your thoughts. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, thank you so much. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=439.68s)]
*  you [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvvqyiQYtk&t=451.76s)]
