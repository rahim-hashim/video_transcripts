# Hegseth will hear 'You're Fired' if he continues to be 'growing problem': Ex-RNC Comms. Director
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg)
*  We begin with NBC's senior national security correspondent, Courtney Qubee, Reuters White [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=0.0s)]
*  House correspondent, Jeff Mason, and former RNC communications director, John High. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=5.28s)]
*  So Courtney, help us understand about the, sorry, help us understand about the so-called [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=10.92s)]
*  dirty line. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  What is it? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so this is an unsecure, as you mentioned, communication line that really defies the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  general security protocol for an internet or for an outside communication line here [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=24.96s)]
*  in the Pentagon. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=30.64s)]
*  Now, most of the offices here are, you're not allowed to bring your phone, no AirPods, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=31.64s)]
*  no Apple watches, nothing like this, but then there are also a number of them that are considered [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=36.28s)]
*  a skiff. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=40.44s)]
*  That's a secure, compartmentalized area. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=41.44s)]
*  What we have now learned, and this really came from, originally from fantastic reporting [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=43.64s)]
*  out of our colleagues at the Associated Press, is that in fact, the secretary defied those [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=47.32s)]
*  normal protocols for securing information here in the Pentagon and insisted that he have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=51.84s)]
*  one of these, quote, dirty lines or an outside, insecure line installed in his office. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=57.36s)]
*  Now, his office is one of those secure, compartmentalized, or generally known as a skiff. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=62.92s)]
*  It is one of those, so it would not generally be allowed in there. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=69.52s)]
*  Now, this just follows a string of incidents that we are learning about and have learned [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  about over the last several weeks about the secretary in which it shows, he appears to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=77.04s)]
*  have a lack of respect or acknowledgement for some of the basic security protocols that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=82.4s)]
*  exist when you're the head of the Pentagon and you have access to so much sensitive information. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=88.48s)]
*  Of course, we learned earlier this week that not only was there the signal chat that was [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  created by National Security Advisor Mike Walsh last month, that Secretary Hegseth included [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=98.44s)]
*  sensitive and imminent military information, operations that were about to unfold with [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=104.16s)]
*  the Houthis in Yemen, but we also learned earlier this week that in fact, he also, the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=109.36s)]
*  secretary started his own signal chat and included family members on it, including his [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=114.32s)]
*  wife, his brother, his personal attorney, and other close aides, and also shared military [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=118.12s)]
*  information on that chat. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=123.4s)]
*  Of course, his wife is not an employee of the Department of Defense. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=125.16s)]
*  His brother is, but really wouldn't have no reason to need to know anything about military [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=128.26s)]
*  operations against the Houthis. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=132.96s)]
*  And Jose, just to add to that, we also learned in fact the information that he was sharing [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=135.04000000000002s)]
*  on these signal chats, this is an unclassified commercial app, that information came directly, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=139.0s)]
*  in some cases word for word, from the commanding general of US Central Command, General Eric [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=146.42000000000002s)]
*  Carrillo. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=150.32s)]
*  General Carrillo sent that to the secretary on a classified system, Jose. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=151.32s)]
*  And what more are you learning about the secretary's behavior? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and so amidst all of these scandals and what has really been a constant drumbeat [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=160.32s)]
*  of reporting about the secretary's judgment, some of the things that he's been doing, the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=165.92s)]
*  secretary has become increasingly erratic, according to a number of officials who we [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  spoke with. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=173.88s)]
*  He seems more and more insecure about his role in the administration, officials saying [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=174.88s)]
*  that he is more increasingly prioritizing things about his image going on Fox News, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=179.04s)]
*  where he thinks he can directly speak to the president, to President Trump, and he can [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=186.32s)]
*  show him he's still a fighter. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=190.28s)]
*  But you mentioned one of the most notable cases here, and that was several weeks ago [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=191.78s)]
*  when the New York Times was about to report that they had learned about this classified [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=196.32s)]
*  Elon Musk briefing on China that was to occur here. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=200.16s)]
*  When the secretary found out that a reporter had uncovered this imminent briefing, he lashed [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  out at the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Chris Grady, telling him that he would [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=207.94s)]
*  expletive polygraph him if he found out that he was a leaker and that he and his staff [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=211.92s)]
*  also threatened to polygraph other senior officials here, as you mentioned, three and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=217.2s)]
*  four star generals and admirals who had not only access to the meeting but the agenda [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=221.2s)]
*  for that meeting. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=225.83999999999997s)]
*  Jose, this is the kind of behavior, look, maybe it happens behind the scenes more often [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  than we realize, but it's not the kind of behavior we're used to hearing from the secretary [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  of defense specifically when dealing with his most senior military advisors and aides. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Jeff, what is the relationship between the president and Hegseth, the vice [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=239.8s)]
*  president and the president have until right now been very strong in their support for [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=243.88000000000002s)]
*  Hegseth. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=248.8s)]
*  Is that also in private? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=250.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think, I mean, I think you're right to emphasize that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=251.52s)]
*  They've been very strong in terms of what they've said about Hegseth in public. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  The press secretary has come out from the podium and said that the president supports [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  him. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  He also picked him for a reason. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  He likes the guy. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=264.6s)]
*  And some of these issues were flagged in terms of Hegseth's inexperience running a big department [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=265.74s)]
*  like this and some other administrative issues, not to mention some of his other personal [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=271.18s)]
*  issues. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=275.86s)]
*  We're all part of his nomination process, and those were things that President Trump [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=276.86s)]
*  was willing to tolerate. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=280.46000000000004s)]
*  If you look, though, at his history of dealing with other aides in his first administration [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=281.94s)]
*  and other top cabinet officials, his patience doesn't last forever. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=287.38s)]
*  So not forecasting anything, but I do understand why a defense secretary in his position would [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=292.02s)]
*  want to be appealing to the president by going on Fox News right now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=298.02s)]
*  Now patience may not last forever, but one questions what happens when his patience run [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=301.5s)]
*  out. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=307.94s)]
*  What does he do or not do? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=308.94s)]
*  Yeah, well, and that's the question that I don't have an answer to. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=310.9s)]
*  It will depend on how this continues to develop, and it will depend on whether President Trump [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=313.38s)]
*  himself feels like Hegseth is just getting unfairly treated by the press or by the people [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=318.18s)]
*  around him, or whether he says, all right, enough is enough. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=323.54s)]
*  This is a distraction from my actual agenda. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=326.42s)]
*  But I do think it's important to underscore that he likes Hegseth. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=329.02s)]
*  He chose him for a reason, and he may have even anticipated that there would be some [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=332.38s)]
*  drama around him because there was drama around his nomination. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=336.78000000000003s)]
*  I want to also bring in MSNBC military analyst and former deputy commander of the U.S. European [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=339.62s)]
*  Command, Lieutenant General Steph Twitty. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=344.58s)]
*  Well, it's great seeing you. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=347.18s)]
*  So Courtney was talking about how the secretary's office is a skiff. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=348.18s)]
*  If you would tell us about what a skiff is and an entire office is a skiff. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=351.74s)]
*  So what would being in a skiff preclude? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=357.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  So, uh, appreciate being on you. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  So there, Jose, it is a secret compartment office where you can take classified information, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  whether it be secret information or top secret information inside his office. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=374.94s)]
*  And it has the security requirements necessary to either talk about classified information [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=380.18s)]
*  or share classified information with folks that are cleared. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=387.86s)]
*  And oh, by the way, everyone that comes in his office that, and they're going to talk [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=393.7s)]
*  information, they must be cleared and there's certain protocols that they must go through [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=400.02s)]
*  before they enter that office, ensuring that they have proper security clearance and so [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=405.26s)]
*  forth. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=410.94s)]
*  But I had a skiff as my time as a general officer. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=411.94s)]
*  My office was used as a skiff and there is various protocols that are necessary before [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=417.74s)]
*  folks can even talk about classified information in that office. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=422.7s)]
*  Doug, from a communications perspective to start, how big of a problem is this for the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=427.53999999999996s)]
*  secretary of defense and for the Trump administration? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=433.53999999999996s)]
*  It's a growing problem. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=436.26s)]
*  And when we look back when this first came out, the response from the White House was [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=437.29999999999995s)]
*  the typical fake news, don't believe any of this. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=441.5s)]
*  And I thought it was a problem because it seemed pretty clear that there was going to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=444.14s)]
*  be a day two, a day three of this story. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=447.38s)]
*  Now we're on week three. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=449.38s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't want to deal this anymore. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=450.7s)]
*  And Jeff's right. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=452.26s)]
*  Donald Trump likes him. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=453.26s)]
*  He wants somebody who will be a fighter on TV and so forth. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=454.3s)]
*  But let's remember, Donald Trump is president in part because of two words. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=457.62s)]
*  You're fired. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=461.02s)]
*  That's his brand. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=462.02s)]
*  That's how most voters know him and his core identity. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=463.18s)]
*  It's who he really is. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=466.5s)]
*  So at some point, I think the straw breaks for Pete Hegseth here because the story just [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=467.5s)]
*  seems to not go away and there's always something new. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=473.42s)]
*  If this continues, Donald Trump at some point is going to say those two words that we know [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=476.3s)]
*  from him so well. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=480.18s)]
*  The question is, you know, controlling the timing, right? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=481.34s)]
*  And I think that there have been reports that the president doesn't like to consider anything [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=485.5s)]
*  that could look like it is playing into the media's narrative, right? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=491.14s)]
*  So is it a situation of timing or is it a situation that if he supports him, he's going [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=496.29999999999995s)]
*  to go support him through hell and high water? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=501.82s)]
*  Well, let's remember, Donald Trump is somebody who doesn't give points. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=504.94s)]
*  He only takes them away one at a time. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=507.46s)]
*  And so if he's able to find a timing situation, let's say the funeral of a pope or a peace [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=509.78s)]
*  deal with Russia and Ukraine, however that gets defined, Donald Trump may have his opportunity [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=514.3s)]
*  to sort of bury that news. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=519.3s)]
*  And we know, not predicting anything for today, but in the first Trump administration, about [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=520.66s)]
*  four o'clock every Friday something big happened. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=524.74s)]
*  Jeff, one of the things that happened recently, the Secretary of Defense's chief of staff [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=527.62s)]
*  resigned, Joe Casper, but he apparently is being reassigned within the administration. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=531.9s)]
*  What do we know about that? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=536.22s)]
*  I don't have any details on that, but I do think just broadly the fact that there's been [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=537.74s)]
*  so much turnover at the Pentagon in the Secretary of Defense's short tenure is also not a great [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=541.1s)]
*  sign. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=546.98s)]
*  It's something that... [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=547.98s)]
*  It suggests disorganization. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=549.82s)]
*  It suggests that they're not being able to really execute, is the word I was looking [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=551.46s)]
*  for, on the priorities that the president has set. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=557.0600000000001s)]
*  So again, it's about drama. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=559.46s)]
*  It's about distractions. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=561.14s)]
*  And the question is how long the president is willing to tolerate that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=563.94s)]
*  What do you think the perspective is in the Oval Office to all of these different things? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=566.58s)]
*  Because the reaction, right, to the tariffs, now Hegsteth, going on three weeks of it, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=573.86s)]
*  what do you think inside the Oval Office? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=580.9000000000001s)]
*  How are they seeing this? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=584.22s)]
*  Well, I think it's true what you were saying before about being backed into a corner and [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=585.62s)]
*  certainly not wanting to play into what the president may perceive as a media narrative. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=589.5400000000001s)]
*  If he feels like he's doing that, then he's going to do the opposite. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=594.74s)]
*  And I think we've got lots of examples of that in multiple different policy and communications [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=597.5600000000001s)]
*  areas. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=602.74s)]
*  So I'm the last person who's going to sit here and predict what the president of the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=603.74s)]
*  United States is going to do. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=606.54s)]
*  But I do think within the Oval Office, they can't be happy about this distraction. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=608.0600000000001s)]
*  I can't imagine that Suzy Wiles, the chief of staff, is happy about this distraction. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=612.54s)]
*  They've got this big 100 days anniversary next week. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=617.02s)]
*  to focus on the things that the president has done, the policy and social society areas [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=621.26s)]
*  that he has upended. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=626.98s)]
*  That's what they want to focus on. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=629.78s)]
*  They don't want to focus on dysfunction. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=630.78s)]
*  Yeah, Suzy Wiles is a well-established pro. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=632.06s)]
*  She's there to run a tight ship. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=634.66s)]
*  DoD is not a tight ship, to put it mildly. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=636.14s)]
*  Everything we see coming out of DoD is bad news and it all emanates from the secretary's [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=639.6999999999999s)]
*  office. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=643.86s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=644.86s)]
*  And so, General, that problem, is that something you see that could be solved within the current [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=645.86s)]
*  DoD? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=650.1s)]
*  So, let me put this in deeper context here, Jose. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=651.1s)]
*  This is about America's sons and daughters, those that are in harm's way right now. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=656.14s)]
*  And so, as we sit here today, we've got the service members in harm's way, whether it [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=662.58s)]
*  be in Syria or Iraq or whether it be in Korea or on the periphery of Russia supporting our [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=667.22s)]
*  NATO allies. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=674.7s)]
*  And our sons and daughters, our service members, they need clarity, they need guidance in their [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=676.66s)]
*  mission. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=683.4599999999999s)]
*  They need someone that they know that is going to back them and not put them in harm's way [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=684.4599999999999s)]
*  by being up on signal when they're trying to execute classified missions. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=688.3s)]
*  And they need steady leadership in the Pentagon. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=694.26s)]
*  So none of this stuff percolates down to them and starts impacting them or morale. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=698.06s)]
*  And so, that's what all this is about in my mind. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rZo7wOnPg&t=704.7s)]
