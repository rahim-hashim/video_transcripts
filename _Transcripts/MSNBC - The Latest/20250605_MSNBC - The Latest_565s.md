# Trump orders investigation of Biden and his aides
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ)
*  And then, of course, that other executive order, signing a wide order, ordering a wide-ranging [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=0.0s)]
*  investigation into former President Joe Biden and his aides, this latest attack on his political [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=5.32s)]
*  rival. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=10.24s)]
*  Trump is accusing the aides of covering up Biden's alleged cognitive decline and using [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=11.24s)]
*  the auto pen to sign bills and assert exclusive presidential power, including on pardons, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=14.96s)]
*  executive orders and other documents. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=19.84s)]
*  Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi and the White House counsel to lead that investigation, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=21.92s)]
*  but the move appears to be an effort to possibly pave the way for Republicans to argue that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=26.44s)]
*  many of Biden's actions as president weren't valid. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=30.06s)]
*  But let's be clear here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=33.38s)]
*  The Justice Department, during its administration under both parties, has recognized the use [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=34.38s)]
*  of auto pen to sign legislation and issue pardons for decades. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=38.26s)]
*  And Trump presented zero evidence that Biden was unaware of any actions taken in his name. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=42.46s)]
*  Also, the president's absolute pardon power is enshrined in the Constitution. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=46.94s)]
*  Biden released a statement, though, on this investigation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=51.74s)]
*  It read in part, let me be clear. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  I made the decisions during my presidency. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=55.620000000000005s)]
*  I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation and proclamations. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=58.42s)]
*  Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=62.86s)]
*  With all that, let's bring in White House reporter for Politico Jake Traylor. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=67.06s)]
*  Jake, let's just start with all of these new White House actions, the revival of the travel [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=70.34s)]
*  ban targeting continually Harvard University and then, of course, Joe Biden. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=75.26s)]
*  Is this a sign that all of the Musk stuff on Capitol Hill is getting to the White House [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=80.56s)]
*  and the president? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=84.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very good question. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=86.34s)]
*  It's something that is not completely unprecedented or unsurprising that we see, especially in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=88.66s)]
*  a Trump administration, in a Trump White House. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=94.5s)]
*  We were looking at a week where there wasn't a lot of good news for Donald Trump, especially [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=96.89999999999999s)]
*  when it came to post after post on X from Elon Musk going after this mega bill, creating [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=101.14s)]
*  quite the stir on Capitol Hill and over at the White House. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=106.56s)]
*  When we have something like this take place, it's not completely uncommon that a lot of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=109.38s)]
*  the White House kind of buries some of those other stories all in there at once. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=114.05999999999999s)]
*  All these actions came yesterday evening pretty unprompted, although talking with White House [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=118.46s)]
*  officials after all these announcements and executive orders came out, they said this [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=123.69999999999999s)]
*  was in the lineup all along. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=127.3s)]
*  It is pretty rare that these happened after the actual workday in the evening time. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=129.06s)]
*  It felt as though a lot of them had just piled up, kind of sweeping and changing the narrative [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=133.5s)]
*  that had kind of consumed Washington so far this week, which has been Musk's consistent [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  attack of this mega bill. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=143.14s)]
*  Yeah, I do think it was striking and interesting, Jake, the fact that Republican senators on [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=144.54s)]
*  the Hill were asked about the resurgence of the travel ban in this new form. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=148.89999999999998s)]
*  And they basically said, oh, well, I don't actually think it's in response to what happened [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=153.73999999999998s)]
*  in Boulder, Colorado, even though that's what the White House is saying. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=157.26s)]
*  Even they said they knew that this was coming at some point. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=160.32s)]
*  Yeah, these types of things often happen whenever we see the White House move really quickly. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  And so the details of that are still parsed out and not entirely clear of the timing of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=167.66s)]
*  all this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=171.7s)]
*  I was speaking with officials late last night who discussing the timing of this, they said [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=173.26s)]
*  exactly what you did, that Boulder was the reason this was amplified and hurried up. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=176.78s)]
*  When we talk to people on the Hill, they say that's not the case. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=181.26s)]
*  It reminds me of when the trade minister was in an actual hearing on the Hill whenever [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=183.98s)]
*  tariffs rapidly change. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=190.62s)]
*  And he was asked in real time, did you know that this has changed? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=191.94s)]
*  And he was not made completely aware. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=194.73999999999998s)]
*  The White House often moves in a very kind of quick, speedy and sometimes not fully communicative [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=196.54s)]
*  way here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=201.14s)]
*  That seems to be the case and we're going to continue to get a readout on that throughout [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  the day. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=204.66s)]
*  Yeah, of course, especially because you're right. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=205.66s)]
*  These executive orders are typically signed with some kind of press access, even if it's [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  just for the pool. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=211.73999999999998s)]
*  The president likes to talk through these usually. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=213.05999999999997s)]
*  This is different, even though, again, the White House and other people on Capitol Hill [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  are saying, yeah, we had some sense that something like this was coming. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=219.82s)]
*  Of course, the fact that it comes against this backdrop is notable, of course, Jake, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=223.73999999999998s)]
*  because Elon Musk is ramping up his criticism of President Trump's legislative agenda, calling [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=227.57999999999998s)]
*  on senators to kill the bill like the seminal bill that will do all of their policy items. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=232.18s)]
*  In a series of social media posts yesterday, the Tesla CEO tried to rally Republicans against [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=237.58s)]
*  the legislation, urging voters to call their senators and congressmen, writing, quote, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=241.86s)]
*  bankrupting America is not OK. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=246.34s)]
*  Musk also suggested drafting a new bill that won't add to the national debt. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=248.98000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=252.66s)]
*  What? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=253.66s)]
*  Like it's hard. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=254.66s)]
*  The comments mark what appears to be an escalation in the rift between Musk and the Trump administration. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=255.66s)]
*  One senior White House official telling NBC News President Trump is now considering how [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  and when to respond, adding that he was, quote, caught off guard, but not entirely surprised [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  by Musk's opposition. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=267.62s)]
*  Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson had this to say. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=268.97999999999996s)]
*  Elon and I left on a great note. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=273.21999999999997s)]
*  We were texting one another, you know, happy texts, you know, Monday. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=274.62s)]
*  And then and then yesterday, you know, 24 hours later, he does a 180 and he comes out [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=278.41999999999996s)]
*  and opposed the bill. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=283.18s)]
*  And it surprised me, frankly. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=284.18s)]
*  I think he's he's flat wrong. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=285.36s)]
*  I think he's he's way off on this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=286.98s)]
*  And I've told him as much and I've said it publicly and privately. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=288.9s)]
*  I'm very consistent in that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=291.58s)]
*  But am I concerned about the effect of this on the midterms? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=292.9s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=295.78s)]
*  Let me tell you why, because when the big, beautiful bill is done and signed into law, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=296.78s)]
*  every single American is going to do better. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=300.06s)]
*  We're going to watch that theory get tested in real time. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=303.02s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the upper chamber, some Republican senators are not taking Musk's criticism lightly, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=305.3s)]
*  asking him to be a little more specific, too. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=310.1s)]
*  I can't respond to generalities. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=313.26s)]
*  If you want to talk about specific provisions in the bill and solutions for it, I mean, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=314.74s)]
*  this is somebody who has got a lot of insight into the U.S. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=319.09999999999997s)]
*  government over the last six months. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=322.82s)]
*  Give us some productive feedback that we can operate on. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=324.21999999999997s)]
*  I can't operate on platitudes or I can't respond to platitudes. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=326.46s)]
*  I wish he'd just say what he what he thinks. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=330.46s)]
*  Look, I think Mr. Musk, I'm a big Musk fan. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=333.86s)]
*  I think he's really smart. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=336.3s)]
*  I think he's entitled to his opinion. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=338.82s)]
*  He's frustrated. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=341.82s)]
*  I think he believes in my judgment correctly that we're quickly becoming debt slaves, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=342.86s)]
*  that Congress needs to to rearm the magical healing power of no. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=349.90000000000003s)]
*  And I agree with him. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=357.3s)]
*  Having said that, I'm not ready to throw in the towel on this bill. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=359.06s)]
*  Interesting comments there. And we're going to hear directly from Senator Kennedy in just a little [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=363.94s)]
*  while when he joins Morning Joe this morning. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=367.34000000000003s)]
*  But a new estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office finds that President Trump's [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=370.14000000000004s)]
*  tax and spending bill would do as Musk and others fear, add two point four trillion dollars [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=373.94s)]
*  to the national debt over the next 10 years. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=379.5s)]
*  The simple math on the bill projects a loss of three point seven trillion dollars in tax revenue [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=381.70000000000005s)]
*  while cutting net spending by one point three trillion dollars. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=385.94s)]
*  The budget office also estimated that nearly 11 million people would lose their health insurance by 2034 [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=389.58000000000004s)]
*  because of spending cuts and new eligibility rules under Medicaid. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=395.14000000000004s)]
*  The new budget projection factors in a series of last minute revisions that Republican leaders made [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=398.9s)]
*  to placate holdouts before the House passed the legislation last month. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=403.53999999999996s)]
*  So, Jake, how are your sources parsing through this moment? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=407.94s)]
*  And what do they think from a White House perspective? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=411.85999999999996s)]
*  The ultimate impact on senators and this legislation is going to be because of Musk. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=414.5s)]
*  Yeah, Ali, that's the question that is on every White House official's mind right now is how impactful [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=420.41999999999996s)]
*  is this actually going to be to the vote? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=425.58s)]
*  I spoke with a lot of White House officials yesterday. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=427.62s)]
*  It's funny, they kept trying to tell me that President Trump was not taking this personally. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=430.09999999999997s)]
*  I would then talk to other folks who said that's exactly how he's taking it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=435.26s)]
*  That's how he takes these types of things. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=437.65999999999997s)]
*  Another official was telling me that this is not entirely surprising, as we've heard, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=440.34s)]
*  because ultimately, Musk was a special government employee for months and in some ways had to go along [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=444.78s)]
*  with his boss, Donald Trump, on some things. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=450.94s)]
*  He's now getting a chance to air some of those grievances or some of those disagreements. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=453.29999999999995s)]
*  And he's doing that from, obviously, his very public profile. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=457.34000000000003s)]
*  Like, Musk is kind of the monster that Trump created. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=460.1s)]
*  He gave him a lot of this authority and potential influence. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=462.58s)]
*  And now he's exerting some of that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=466.26s)]
*  Most of the officials are telling me that they don't believe this actually has the power. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=468.34000000000003s)]
*  Musk's criticism doesn't have the power to sink the bill. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=472.66s)]
*  It's not that it's not going to go through anymore. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=475.74s)]
*  They still say they feel very confident about that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=478.82s)]
*  What it does most importantly, though, is it gives some of these Republican holdouts that the Josh Hollys [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=481.3s)]
*  and others who already are showing some hesitancy towards supporting this bill. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=486.26s)]
*  What it does is it gives them more and more opportunity to dig their heels in. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=491.3s)]
*  And ultimately, it might end up having to make the White House give certain concessions to these senators [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=495.78s)]
*  that they weren't planning on doing in the first place. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=500.65999999999997s)]
*  So it doesn't entirely sink the bill, they say, but it does frustrate them. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=502.94s)]
*  And that's clear from some of the response yesterday. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=505.94s)]
*  I think that's right. I mean, it definitely shakes the turf on Capitol Hill. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=508.09999999999997s)]
*  What I think some people on the House side were expecting to be minimal changes from the Senate. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=511.98s)]
*  Now they are bolstered in their ability to make some and the White House may have to give them that cover [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=516.18s)]
*  because of Elon Musk. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=521.38s)]
*  And then once again, it leaves House Republicans in the position that many of them were worried about, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=522.78s)]
*  which is defending on the campaign trail the most, we could say, extreme version of this bill. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=526.42s)]
*  And they're going to still have to take that back to their constituents after defending Musk and Doge [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=532.14s)]
*  for all of these months in front of angry town halls. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=536.62s)]
*  Jake Traylor, thank you, as always, for coming on. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=539.9s)]
*  We appreciate your reporting. A lot to cover here. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=542.3399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=546.18s)]
