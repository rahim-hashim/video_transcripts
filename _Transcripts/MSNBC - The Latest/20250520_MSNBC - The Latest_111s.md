**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0)
*  Melanie, what are we hearing from lawmakers this morning about the congresswoman's charges? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, Democrats have been outraged in the wake of this news. A number of statements pouring in [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=5.28s)]
*  accusing these charges of being politically motivated. Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=10.0s)]
*  leader, saying Democrats are going to respond vigorously at a time and place of their choosing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=14.4s)]
*  So, TBD, whether they mount a more formal response. But our colleague Brennan Leach [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  actually caught up with the congresswoman this morning, offering her first public comments [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=22.72s)]
*  since we learned of these charges. Take a listen to that moment. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=26.96s)]
*  Representative, can we talk to you about the charges brought against you? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=31.12s)]
*  It's political intimidation and I'm looking forward to my day in court. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=34.88s)]
*  Do you know about the charges prior to the press conference? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=39.04s)]
*  What have you heard from your fellow Democrats? Have they been supported? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=50.24s)]
*  I just want to say thank you to everyone who's been supported. You know, both Democrats and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=53.92s)]
*  all of the folks, you know, around this nation who understand and know what this administration, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=58.56s)]
*  you know, has been doing to judges, to political leaders, lacking people of undue process. And so, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  at the end of the day, we just really look forward to the day in court. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  And Speaker Mike Johnson has said that he is supportive of potential legal action against [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=76.48s)]
*  the congresswoman and also said that Republicans are looking at potentially punishing the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=80.48s)]
*  congresswoman, whether in the form of a censure resolution or even stripping her of her committee [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=84.48s)]
*  assignments. So, something to look out for here in Capitol Hill as well. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDdteIkwb0&t=110.48s)]
