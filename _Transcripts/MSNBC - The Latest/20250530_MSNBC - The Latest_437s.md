# Even though Musk is leaving 'this is not the end' of DOGE: Dem lawmaker
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI)
*  Congresswoman Melanie Stansberry of New Mexico, ranking member of the House Doge subcommittee. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=0.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, thanks for being with us. First, your reaction to this new reporting from the New [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  York Times today about Musk. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=12.16s)]
*  I mean, I think we all knew that Mr. Musk was using drugs. And if you observed his behavior over the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=14.16s)]
*  last three and a half months, it's very obvious that he was completely out of control. And he [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=21.6s)]
*  wreaked havoc on the federal government. So it does not surprise me that it was being enhanced by [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  substances that make you act crazy. But I think, you know, it's not a joke because he has literally [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=33.44s)]
*  shattered thousands of American lives. He's disrupted our entire federal government. And just like [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=39.84s)]
*  other rich dudes who want to tinker with what they think are toys, this is not a joke. This is the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=45.84s)]
*  democracy that is our country and the American people's lives. So, you know, there's going to be [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=53.12s)]
*  very serious consequences. And we will hold Elon Musk accountable for the damages that he's done. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=59.68s)]
*  How do you plan to hold him accountable? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=65.2s)]
*  So at the current moment, obviously, Democrats are not in control of Congress. But the courts are [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=68.08s)]
*  our key tool right now. And I think it's important to observe that over the last 130 days that Elon [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  Musk has been a special government employee, there are now over 200 federal court cases have [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=80.0s)]
*  been filed against the Trump administration for lawless behavior. That includes everything from [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=86.56s)]
*  illegal dismantling of USAID and letting children starve around the world. It includes the mass [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=92.72s)]
*  firings that were illegal. It includes the illegal data hacking that happened of American data. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=98.64s)]
*  Those court cases are pending. There are dozens of court injunctions. And myself and Jamie Raskin [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  have also filed legislation for civil liability against Elon Musk and any special government [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=113.2s)]
*  employee. But it also necessitates that we win back the House and use the tools of Congress to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=120.24s)]
*  hold him accountable. Right now, the courts are our primary tool. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=127.12s)]
*  I mean, you talk about the fights in the courts, you discuss some of the impacts of Doge. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=130.72s)]
*  And yet we expect to see a united front between the president and Musk in this departure event [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=135.28s)]
*  today at the White House. If you were to just kind of boil it down, just 130 days, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=139.28s)]
*  how do you see Musk's tenure as the president's right-hand billionaire? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=143.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's important to not be lulled into a sense of complacency. This battle is not [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=148.32s)]
*  over yet. The White House has been very clear that Doge is not going anywhere. And it's very clear [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=153.84s)]
*  that Doge will now be transitioned to the work of OMB and Russell Vaughn, who is the architect [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=159.04s)]
*  of Project 2025 and in some ways a much more dangerous figure because he's worked in the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  White House previously. In fact, he was behind Donald Trump's illegal activities that led to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=169.6s)]
*  his first impeachment. He understands the mechanisms of how the government works. And he's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=174.48s)]
*  already transmitted a set of proposals to the Hill to make Doge's cuts permanent. We also know that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=179.28s)]
*  staff have burrowed in at every single agency in the last few weeks. They've been even more [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=185.2s)]
*  aggressive in entering agencies where there is clearly no executive jurisdiction. So I think [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=189.76s)]
*  it's important, you know, Donald Trump is a master of distraction. We can't be distracted by this [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  Oval Office dog and pony show they're going to roll out tonight because even though Elon Musk [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  may be exiting the building for now, the battle against Doge is squarely still here. And we're [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=208.64s)]
*  going to have to continue to make sure that we hold them accountable. White House press secretary [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=214.8s)]
*  Caroline Levitt was asked about Doge's leadership now that Musk is going to be gone and listen to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=220.08s)]
*  what she said. Is there a Doge leader taking the place of Mr. Musk? Well, again, the Doge leaders [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=225.28s)]
*  are each and every member of the president's cabinet and the president himself, who is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=233.12s)]
*  wholeheartedly committed to cutting waste, fraud and abuse. So even if Musk is gone, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=236.4s)]
*  you talk about Russell vote stepping into kind of this new head of Doge, if you will, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=242.32s)]
*  she says the president's going to be the one leading it up. And we know the impacts aren't [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=247.84s)]
*  over yet. A White House official telling Politico that the true DNA of Doge is within the agencies [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  where Doge staff still work. So I have to wonder if you're a public servant in one of these agencies, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=260.08s)]
*  should you be concerned? Oh, absolutely. I mean, we know that there are Doge staff sitting in the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=265.92s)]
*  cabinet secretary offices of almost every major agency. And we've seen this play out even over the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=273.04s)]
*  last week at Department of Interior, the Doge official who's sitting there essentially escorted [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=279.36s)]
*  a senior career official who spent 40 years of their life at the BLM out of the building because [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  he wouldn't comply with essentially the activities that the Doge appointee wanted them to do. But I [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=291.28s)]
*  also think, and I really want to make sure that people understand that what Doge is doing is not [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=298.08s)]
*  only not normal and in many cases not legal inside these agencies, they've gotten even more [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=302.96s)]
*  aggressive. In fact, over the last couple of weeks, they tried to enter congressional offices. Now, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  the executive has zero, zero jurisdiction over Congress. You know, the Constitution says this, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=313.67999999999995s)]
*  but they've tried to enter GAO. They've tried to enter the Library of Congress and even the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=320.8s)]
*  personnel office for Congress. So what they're doing is getting even more aggressive, not less. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=325.68s)]
*  So just because Musk is leaving, this is not the end. And while Musk may be stepping away from the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=332.56s)]
*  day-to-day work of the administration, he will still be heavily involved in the government's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  happenings with his personal companies. You've said Musk benefited directly from his work with [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=341.76s)]
*  Doge. So what can you as a member of the Oversight Committee do about that? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=347.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we've opened over 100 investigations into Elon Musk and Doge's [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=353.12s)]
*  self-dealing. It's very clear that whatever his original intentions, Musk has utilized the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  opportunity to give himself massive amounts of government contracts. We know that he switched [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=363.68s)]
*  much of the federal government's communication systems to Starlink. In fact, one of the latest [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  reports I just got yesterday was that he's doing it at MSF. We know that he's used his access to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=375.52s)]
*  priming the pump for billions of dollars in DoD contracts for SpaceX. And we know that his staff [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=382.88s)]
*  have downloaded sensitive government data, our personal data as Americans, and have been using [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=389.28s)]
*  it to train their AI systems. So the Oversight Committee Democrats have opened many investigations. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=395.28s)]
*  These are ongoing, and they are in coordination with our state attorney generals and these court [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=402.32s)]
*  cases that are pending investigating what they're doing in the courts. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=407.44s)]
*  Congresswoman Melanie Stansbury, thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate your time. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHVS2dEDWI&t=431.76s)]
