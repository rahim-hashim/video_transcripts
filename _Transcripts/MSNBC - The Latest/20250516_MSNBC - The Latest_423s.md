# ‘Assault on the Constitution’: Lawyer for Georgetown scholar detained by ICE
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M)
*  There was no charge, there was nothing. They made a subhuman out of me. They took me from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=0.0s)]
*  one center to another, not letting my family know, not letting me know that I have attorneys. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=7.26s)]
*  That's Bidar Khan Sourie, the Georgetown University scholar who was freed from ICE custody this [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  week after months in detention. A judge saying the government failed to provide sufficient [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=20.66s)]
*  evidence against him and violated his First Amendment right to free speech. The Department [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=25.7s)]
*  of Homeland Security says Khan Sourie spread Hamas propaganda and promoted anti-Semitism [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=31.46s)]
*  online, allegations he denies. Joining us now is Bidar Khan Sourie's attorney, Eden [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=36.26s)]
*  Heilman, who is also the legal director for the ACLU of Virginia. Eden, thanks for being [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=42.099999999999994s)]
*  here. Bidar is free now, but this fight is not over. He's still facing deportation proceedings, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=47.34s)]
*  what's next? He has proceedings happening concurrently in two different courts. He's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=52.98s)]
*  got his immigration proceedings where the government is attempting to remove him from [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=60.72s)]
*  the country and we have immigration attorneys working with him to fight those removal proceedings [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=65.38s)]
*  and then we have his habeas corpus case, which is the one that's in federal court. In that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=72.3s)]
*  we are challenging the constitutionality of the government's actions in arresting and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=77.5s)]
*  detaining him. Bidar says he felt subhuman throughout this process. What do we know about [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=83.14s)]
*  his treatment and conditions that he faced while he was detained? Yeah, unfortunately, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=89.89999999999999s)]
*  he faced some very harsh conditions while he was detained. First, he was picked up during [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=95.34s)]
*  Ramadan, so he was unable to fully practice and celebrate the holiday with his community. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=100.14s)]
*  He was not given meals and water when he was breaking his fast because it was in the process [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=108.26s)]
*  of him being moved from detention center to detention center. When he finally got to prairie [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=114.1s)]
*  land in Texas, he was classified as high security, so he was put in a particular red jumpsuit [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=119.3s)]
*  and was put under very heavy restrictions, including only two hours a week of recreation [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=126.46s)]
*  or outdoor time. He also was put in a really overcrowded unit where we understand that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=133.22s)]
*  there was 50 some people in a 36 person unit. He was originally given a cot on the floor [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=138.62s)]
*  of the TV room to sleep on. So yeah, he faced some really incredibly difficult conditions [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=144.78s)]
*  Did they give a reason why he was placed in high security? No, unfortunately, we have [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=150.9s)]
*  received very little information or evidence from the government about any of their theories [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=157.5s)]
*  of this case. Bidar is married to a U.S. citizen. They have three children under 10. Can't help [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=161.54000000000002s)]
*  but wonder, given everything he's gone through, as you just described it, does he still want [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=167.74s)]
*  to be in the U.S.? Is this the country he thought it was? Yeah, no, that's a great question. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=171.84s)]
*  I think, if anything, this experience with the court has restored his faith in America's [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=177.58s)]
*  justice system. Him and his wife, you know, his wife is a U.S. citizen and he is an Indian [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=182.26000000000002s)]
*  national. They came here. He's an academic. They came here to pursue his academic career [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=186.98000000000002s)]
*  as well as hers. And they really truly believed that the U.S. would be a place where they [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=193.02s)]
*  could raise their children in a welcoming environment that was, you know, tolerant of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=197.74s)]
*  and beliefs. And they were shocked that this has happened to them. But at the same time, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=203.42s)]
*  I think, you know, given the recent court decision, he is feeling a renewed sense of justice [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=208.89999999999998s)]
*  in this community and in the U.S. courts. Again, we mentioned how the Department of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=215.66s)]
*  Homeland Security is claiming that he spread Hamas propaganda, that he's promoting anti-Semitism [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=220.38s)]
*  online. What say you to those charges? Yeah, we have not seen what the government is saying, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=226.70000000000002s)]
*  particularly, is the Hamas propaganda that he is supporting or posting online. And again, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=234.06s)]
*  you know, the First Amendment protects speech and political speech at a heightened level. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=239.02s)]
*  And so when somebody engages in political speech about what they believe, you know, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=244.3s)]
*  the government is doing that could be illegal or problematic, that is, you know, deserving of the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  most protection. And the government here has not indicated to us what or to Dr. Suri what [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=253.82s)]
*  particularly they are finding to be Hamas propaganda or promotion of anti-Semitism. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=261.34s)]
*  Your client is one of a few scholars who judges have granted release. We've been following other [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=266.54s)]
*  cases, including that of Tufts student, Ramesa Ozturk and Columbia student Mohsin Madhawi, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=270.78s)]
*  who've also been released as their cases proceed. It took months for each of these cases just to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=276.3s)]
*  get to this point. How long could it take for these habeas petitions to be resolved? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=282.46s)]
*  Yeah, all of the cases are actually proceeding using kind of different mechanisms or different [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=288.94s)]
*  things have been priorities in those cases. Immigration cases. So let me say this first [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=292.94s)]
*  about his immigration case could take years potentially. So you have the underlying immigration [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=297.65999999999997s)]
*  case that can be appealed and then on up through the federal court system. His habeas case is [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=301.82s)]
*  similar. So right now, we just found out last night the government, you know, has filed their [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=306.94s)]
*  notice of appeal of the judge's decision on based on his release yesterday. So that appeal will go [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=311.1s)]
*  up through the courts as well. And then likewise, we will continue to to litigate the underlying [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=318.06s)]
*  habeas case. You know, the most important part, though, is that he's free. So we will continue [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=324.06s)]
*  to kind of revel in the fact that he is free during this time while we go forward and prosecute [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=328.54s)]
*  his case. I mean, those habeas cases seem so crucial for having a chance in the current system [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=333.1s)]
*  for their freedom, for them to be able to stay in the U.S. But White House Deputy Chief of Staff, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=338.94s)]
*  Stephen Miller, has said this administration is looking at trying to suspend habeas corpus, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=344.94s)]
*  a person's right to challenge their detention. How concerned are you about that happening? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=349.18s)]
*  Very concerned. I believe it would be very illegal for them to do that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=354.3s)]
*  Habeas corpus is sort of the bedrock of our constitutional law, and it allows individuals [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=358.22s)]
*  to challenge the government's detention of them for a variety of reasons. And the idea that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=363.02s)]
*  we could potentially be suspending that not in a time of war, not because there's any major [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=368.78s)]
*  national crisis or emergency is incredibly alarming. And as you mentioned, these habeas [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=375.74s)]
*  cases are what have given the ability for people to challenge the government's illegal detention [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=382.38s)]
*  of them. And that has been backed and supported by the courts. So cutting out that ability to do [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=387.9s)]
*  that would be a huge undercutting and assault on the U.S. Constitution. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=392.14s)]
*  Due process. We talked so much about. Eden Heilman, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=396.78000000000003s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfCdoUw-9M&t=401.82000000000005s)]
