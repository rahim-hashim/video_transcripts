# Lawrence: Donald Trump is now America's biggest loser in the history of presidents' first 100 days
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs)
*  Well, imagine a 78-year-old man who often speaks incoherently and lies to you in ways [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=0.0s)]
*  that leave you wondering whether he is a pathological liar or delusional or both pocket dials someone [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=7.4s)]
*  he doesn't want to talk to at 1.28 a.m. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=15.0s)]
*  And then imagine that same 78-year-old man is angrily braying at the world at 5.24 a.m. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=20.84s)]
*  claiming people have committed crimes, crimes that do not exist, and coming up with a name [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=31.2s)]
*  for those people committing the crimes that don't exist using words that have never been [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  joined together and make absolutely no sense, calling them, quote, negative criminals. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=45.28s)]
*  Of course you would be concerned about the mental health of such a person. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  Of course you would assume some kind of serious neurological decline in the 78-year-old man. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  Imagine that same 78-year-old man also said, I run the country and the world. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=63.2s)]
*  Imagine now, imagine if Joe Biden had done just one of those things. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=72.72s)]
*  There would have been four inch headlines about cognitive decline. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  But that's just one news cycle with Donald Trump, who did every one of those things. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=85.72s)]
*  He butt dialed a reporter for the Atlantic at 1.28 a.m. who he did not want to talk to, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=93.14s)]
*  not with whom he did eventually do an interview in which he said, I run the country and the world. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=100.48s)]
*  No one runs the country. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=109.04s)]
*  No one ever has. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=111.04s)]
*  No one ever will. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=112.36s)]
*  This country was founded on that very principle. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  This country was founded by people escaping the rule of one person, escaping the rule [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=116.78s)]
*  of a king. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=122.38000000000001s)]
*  And so, no, the president does not run the country. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  The president at best, if he knows what he's doing, runs a section and only a section of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=127.76s)]
*  the federal government, the executive branch. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=134.72s)]
*  The president of the United States has absolutely nothing to do with thousands upon thousands [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=138.24s)]
*  of state laws that exist in this country and city laws and all of the different state tax [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=145.44s)]
*  rates that exist in this country. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=152.84s)]
*  People have tried to run the world, people like Adolf Hitler, but no one ever has. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  And so, no, Donald Trump does not run the country and the world. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=161.68s)]
*  And it sounds fully delusional when he says it in an interview with the Atlantic, which [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=167.24s)]
*  now carries that line as the title of the piece. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=172.28s)]
*  I run the country and the world. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  Some Republicans have tried to justify that delusional declaration by invoking the concept [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=183.64s)]
*  of the president of the United States as the leader of the free world. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  That is a cliché that I have never personally indulged in, but it really is just a cliché [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=193.55999999999997s)]
*  and it's never actually been true. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=198.2s)]
*  And no previous president, all of whom since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, have at some point [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=201.48s)]
*  been referred to in the media as the leader of the free world, has never claimed that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=207.04s)]
*  title for himself. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=212.4s)]
*  No president has ever done that, because every previous president who actually tried to lead [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=214.04s)]
*  other countries in one direction or another always knew that the easiest way to destroy [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=220.4s)]
*  a president's ability to lead other countries in this world, to cooperate with us, would [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=227.36s)]
*  be a publicly expressed sense of American presidential superiority over all of those [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=233.12s)]
*  countries and over all of those leaders of those countries who the American president [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=240.76s)]
*  might be trying to persuade. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=245.12s)]
*  And so Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who brilliantly managed the allied countries who won World [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=247.6s)]
*  War II, and Joe Biden, who brilliantly managed the alliance of countries who have rushed [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=253.92s)]
*  to the support of Ukraine, always publicly did that kind of leadership with humility, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=259.48s)]
*  because that's the only way. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  The man who says, I run the world, is being rebuked literally by the world right now and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=271.12s)]
*  every single day since he has imposed tariffs on the world. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=279.96000000000004s)]
*  Not one country has accepted those tariffs. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=286.4s)]
*  Not one country isn't fighting back against those tariffs. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=290.6s)]
*  In China, the principal target of the Trump tariffs, through a government spokesperson, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=294.0s)]
*  said, we will fight till the end. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=299.88s)]
*  That's how much Donald Trump does not run the world. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=304.88s)]
*  Donald Trump started a trade war that he is losing every day. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=308.68s)]
*  Donald Trump could not have chosen a stupider or more delusional moment to say, I run the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=312.64s)]
*  country and the world. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=320.36s)]
*  As of tonight, new polling indicates the country doesn't want Donald Trump running anything [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=322.88s)]
*  now. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump has achieved a new record, and all of Donald Trump's records are the most [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  extreme form of negative achievement. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=335.56s)]
*  The New Washington Post poll awards a record to Donald Trump, reporting that Donald Trump's [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=339.4s)]
*  job approval rating is, quote, lower than for any past president at the 100-day mark [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=346.24s)]
*  in their first or second terms. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=355.52s)]
*  Donald Trump is now America's biggest loser in the history of first 100-day presidential [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=359.16s)]
*  polling. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  55% say they disapprove of how Donald Trump is handling his job, and only 39% approve. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump won 49% of the vote in the last election, but he couldn't come close to that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=377.24s)]
*  now. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=382.52000000000004s)]
*  The only comfort for Donald Trump in this week's new round of polling is that the richest [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=384.0s)]
*  person in the world polls just slightly worse than Donald Trump. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=389.24s)]
*  57% disapprove of what Elon Musk is doing, with just 35% approving. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=392.8s)]
*  Americans think that the Trump-invented so-called Department of Government efficiency, allegedly [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=398.12s)]
*  run by Elon Musk, isn't finding waste or fraud in government. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=403.52s)]
*  56% say that waste has either stayed the same or has increased compared to 43% who think [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=408.68s)]
*  it has decreased. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=415.4s)]
*  And 68% say that fraud has either stayed the same or has increased. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=416.4s)]
*  Donald Trump, speaking of fraud, is the first president of the United States to try to hustle [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=424.24s)]
*  private business ventures from the White House and do it publicly, auctioning off for money [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=429.68s)]
*  that he can put in his pocket, not for campaign contributions, dinners at the White House, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=438.12s)]
*  creating his own cryptocurrency coin business. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=443.12s)]
*  No president has ever tried to profit from the presidency while in the White House. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=446.0s)]
*  59% express concern that Donald Trump is doing too much to reduce the size and role of government, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=452.92s)]
*  with 56% saying correctly that Donald Trump acted beyond his authority as president without [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=460.44s)]
*  justification. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=467.36s)]
*  That's what's happening in the country that Donald Trump says he runs. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=468.36s)]
*  56% are saying Donald Trump is trying to act beyond his authority as president, and that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=475.0s)]
*  56% understand that no one is supposed to run this country. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=481.08s)]
*  That is not the definition of the presidency that a majority of this country correctly [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=486.0s)]
*  embraces or that the Constitution provides for. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=491.04s)]
*  Donald Trump does run his private businesses. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=494.96s)]
*  He still does every day. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=497.68s)]
*  He runs them for profit from the White House. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=500.12s)]
*  But he does not run the country, and he absolutely does not run the world. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=503.24s)]
*  It's not just every other country in the world that knows how harmful the Trump tariffs are. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=510.76s)]
*  A huge majority of Americans know that. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=516.6s)]
*  64% disapprove of Donald Trump's tariffs. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=520.72s)]
*  The Washington Post calls it one of the least popular issues so far in Trump's presidency. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=524.8s)]
*  64% of the people in this country know that Donald Trump's tariffs are a very bad idea. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=530.72s)]
*  72% say they think it's very or somewhat likely that his economic policies will cause [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=539.44s)]
*  a recession. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  72% say Donald Trump is on his way to causing a recession, and it's very, very hard in [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=547.8800000000001s)]
*  modern American politics to get polling numbers like 72% on anything. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  And it is virtually impossible to get polling numbers like 89%. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=561.28s)]
*  Only something as obviously deranged as the Trump tariffs could produce that kind of number [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=569.9599999999999s)]
*  in a poll, 89% think the Trump tariffs are likely to result in higher prices on the products [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=575.04s)]
*  they buy. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=583.0799999999999s)]
*  89% are saying in that poll they know Donald Trump lied every single time he told them [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=584.72s)]
*  during the presidential campaign that China would pay his tariffs. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=591.48s)]
*  89% are saying they know Donald Trump was lying when he said the tariffs that he will [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=595.88s)]
*  impose will be paid by Canada and paid by Mexico and by all the foreign countries he [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=601.72s)]
*  illegally imposes tariffs on, claiming that it's a national security issue, which it obviously [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=608.36s)]
*  isn't. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=613.6s)]
*  Tonight, 89% know the man who claims to run the country and the world is completely wrong [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=614.6s)]
*  about who actually pays the Trump tariffs. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=622.88s)]
*  They understand exactly what all those radio and TV ads from car dealers are about, telling [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=625.36s)]
*  them to rush in to get the pre-tariff price on a new car. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=631.76s)]
*  And they know time is running out or has run out for that pre-tariff price, and they're [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=637.72s)]
*  going to pay that tariff if they buy a new car. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=644.12s)]
*  At 5.24 a.m. today, the man who thinks he runs the country and the world reacted to [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=647.76s)]
*  the Washington Post poll by, of course, attacking the poll and calling the people who conduct [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=654.96s)]
*  the poll, quote, his words, negative criminals. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=665.2s)]
*  Donald Trump said, these people should be investigated for election fraud. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=672.04s)]
*  They are negative criminals. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=679.04s)]
*  And so, as ragingly unconstitutional delusional rants by presidents go, Donald Trump is, once [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=682.8s)]
*  again, the big winner because no other president has really had a public, ragingly unconstitutional, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=690.4s)]
*  delusional comment about anything. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=701.76s)]
*  Donald Trump said in writing that the people who conduct the Washington Post poll should [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=705.8s)]
*  be investigated for election fraud, should be investigated for a crime. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=711.56s)]
*  That should be a criminal investigation. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=716.28s)]
*  OK. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=717.8s)]
*  That means his attorney general, Pam Bondi, should be in the middle of that investigation [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=718.88s)]
*  right now tonight. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=722.8s)]
*  That also means someone's going to have to completely rewrite the law on election fraud [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=723.9599999999999s)]
*  to make accurate polling illegal, which, of course, a little thing that Donald Trump has [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=729.68s)]
*  never comprehended the First Amendment will not allow. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=736.0799999999999s)]
*  There isn't another president in history who thought that anyone working at the Washington [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=741.1999999999999s)]
*  Post was a criminal. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=747.44s)]
*  Richard Nixon knew that Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were on track [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=750.72s)]
*  in their investigative reporting in 1973 and 1974 to destroy the Nixon presidency and drive [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=755.5600000000001s)]
*  him out of office, which is exactly what they did. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=761.7600000000001s)]
*  And Richard Nixon never called either one of them a criminal. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=764.5200000000001s)]
*  Never. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=771.9200000000001s)]
*  Richard Nixon never thought Woodward and Bernstein were criminals. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=772.9200000000001s)]
*  Richard Nixon knew exactly who the criminals were. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=776.92s)]
*  Richard Nixon knew the criminals were working for him. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=780.24s)]
*  Richard Nixon knew he was a criminal. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=783.4799999999999s)]
*  Richard Nixon knew the White House counsel was a criminal. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=785.68s)]
*  Richard Nixon knew his attorney general was a criminal. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=788.3199999999999s)]
*  Richard Nixon knew his White House chief of staff was a criminal. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=790.92s)]
*  And they were all found to be criminals in federal court except Richard Nixon, who received [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=794.04s)]
*  a presidential pardon a month after he resigned the presidency for all the crimes he committed [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=800.28s)]
*  during his presidency. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=804.76s)]
*  Remember when the Trump team was promising 90 trade deals in 90 days around the world [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=807.68s)]
*  in 90 days, solve the problem? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=815.2399999999999s)]
*  Because the man who believes he runs the world was going to fix everything himself. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=819.04s)]
*  We're going to run 90 deals in 90 days is possible. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=827.12s)]
*  The boss is going to be the chief negotiator. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=832.28s)]
*  Nothing's done without him looking very carefully at it. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=835.08s)]
*  He has such a fine attention to detail. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=838.48s)]
*  It's impossible to get more cloudish than that man. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=843.5600000000001s)]
*  That was 17 days ago. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=847.0s)]
*  Do we have 17 trade deals? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=851.16s)]
*  No. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=853.32s)]
*  How many do we have? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=854.36s)]
*  Zero. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=856.4s)]
*  Exactly zero. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=858.5600000000001s)]
*  17 days and zero trade deals is what he meant to say. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=859.5999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump suggested that China would be begging for a trade deal. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=863.3199999999999s)]
*  The president of China would immediately pick up the phone and call Donald Trump. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=868.3599999999999s)]
*  The president of China hasn't done that. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=871.76s)]
*  And Donald Trump is still trying to claim that negotiations on a trade deal with China, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=874.3599999999999s)]
*  which would be the single most complex trade deal ever negotiated with a single country [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=878.8s)]
*  in the history of the world, is actually happening. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=884.76s)]
*  A trade deal like that normally takes years. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=888.28s)]
*  And China says nothing's happening. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=892.04s)]
*  China says there are no negotiations. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=895.1999999999999s)]
*  Now imagine the president of China and everyone in the Chinese government watching Donald [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=897.24s)]
*  Trump publicly demonstrate just how weak he is compared to them by lying about them. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=901.76s)]
*  Donald Trump is claiming that there are negotiations going on with China because Americans, as [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=908.12s)]
*  shown in those polls, hate his tariffs. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=912.88s)]
*  The Chinese government has the luxury of not caring what anyone outside the government [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=917.0799999999999s)]
*  thinks of this trade war. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=920.9599999999999s)]
*  The president of China doesn't run the world, but he sure does run China. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=923.16s)]
*  So President Xi doesn't have to worry about public opinion the way Donald Trump does. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=929.16s)]
*  That's why President Xi hasn't budged. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=933.7199999999999s)]
*  And Donald Trump has. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=936.7199999999999s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial board says China called Mr. Trump's bluff and seems to [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=938.64s)]
*  have won this round. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=942.68s)]
*  In a new article titled Trump's Tariffs Have Done What No U.S. Adversary Could, Franco [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=945.44s)]
*  Marchalik writes, the blanket erratic and often nonsensical nature of the tariffs has, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=951.0s)]
*  far from showing signs of jumpstarting the long process of reshoring manufacturing jobs, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=958.08s)]
*  actually proven a major obstacle to that project while also leading manufacturers to shed jobs [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=964.32s)]
*  or scale back their plans and plunging the entire U.S. economy into uncertainty more broadly. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=970.24s)]
*  This reached a crescendo with the mass sell-off of U.S. Treasury bonds earlier this month [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=976.4s)]
*  that briefly threatened to send the entire U.S. financial system buckling. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=981.28s)]
*  Trump, in other words, has not just inadvertently demonstrated the extent of the United States' [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=987.52s)]
*  dependence on China. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=992.72s)]
*  He has also wound up demonstrating other key nations' similar dependence while revealing [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=994.24s)]
*  stark limits to Washington's ability to make even its allies do what it wants. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=1000.64s)]
*  So much for the man who says, I run the country and the world. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=1013.72s)]
*  The guy who claims he runs the world has not been able to negotiate a single trade deal [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=1018.56s)]
*  with a single country in the world since promising 90 deals in 90 days. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=1026.04s)]
*  That makes Donald Trump, according to his own definition of success in this arena, the [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=1032.6799999999998s)]
*  biggest loser in international trade in the history of the American presidency and no [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=1037.0s)]
*  amount of delusional screaming about Donald Trump's negative criminals can change what [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpCtY0JQvjs&t=1043.4s)]
