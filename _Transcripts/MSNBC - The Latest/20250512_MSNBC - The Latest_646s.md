# How Mo Amer used his Netflix show to shed light on immigration policies
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg)
*  The Trump administration continuing its assault on democracy this week first attacking US [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=0.0s)]
*  judges for not giving the president free reign, then threatening to suspend habeas corpus, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=5.14s)]
*  which is the right of a person to challenge their detention in court. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  But on Friday, a temporary win for due process from Issa Osturk, a Turkish international [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=14.68s)]
*  student was freed from ICE detention on Friday. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=20.0s)]
*  You may recall back in March, she was abducted by plainclothes officers while she was on [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=23.1s)]
*  the phone with her mother. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=28.08s)]
*  A federal judge says that the government offered no evidence for why Ramesa was arrested other [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  than this op-ed that she wrote in her student newspaper criticizing her university's ties [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=35.12s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  Now, her case along with the others highlights the administration's continued attempt to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  silence dissent by taking away due process rights for immigrants. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=46.28s)]
*  Joining us now is comedian and legal law expert Mo Amir. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=51.0s)]
*  What are you guys doing to me? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  Who tackles a lot of these issues on his Netflix show, Mo and MSNBC legal analyst Charles [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=58.48s)]
*  Kohn will let him do the legal commentary. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=63.08s)]
*  Please. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=65.12s)]
*  But you're more than welcome to weigh in on it as well. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=66.12s)]
*  But it's interesting because your show, which came out way before this happened, you're [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=67.72s)]
*  Palestinian American, you have an incredible show. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=73.56s)]
*  I encourage everyone to watch season two. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=76.28s)]
*  You're at the nexus of immigration and free speech in this country. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=78.6s)]
*  And now we're seeing firsthand these students, these, you know, in the case of Mahmoud Khalil, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=82.6s)]
*  a Palestinian green card holder, Ramesa, Turkish citizen, Mohsen Mahdi. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=87.24s)]
*  In some ways, you wrote the script for what we're kind of seeing right now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=93.0s)]
*  I'm just curious, what do you make of this development in this country? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Are you blaming this on me? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=100.6s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=101.6s)]
*  Are you psychic? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=102.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=103.6s)]
*  How did you know this was going to happen? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=104.6s)]
*  Nostradamus is wrong a lot, by the way. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=107.52s)]
*  That's a whole other conversation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=109.08s)]
*  But no, I really, you know, I went through the immigration system myself. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=110.84s)]
*  I was an asylee to the states. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  It took me 20 years to get my citizenship. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=116.4s)]
*  And to be honest with you, I kind of saw it, you know, really a long time ago. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=118.0s)]
*  And I kind of want to tackle these things a lot earlier. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=122.92s)]
*  But until I feel like Hollywood caught up and understood, like, these stories absolutely [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=125.08s)]
*  need to be told. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=130.32s)]
*  And just to explore all these things within my series and to see things, you know, unfolding [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=132.04s)]
*  the way they are today is really shocking, to be honest. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=137.32s)]
*  Like, we went into a detention center. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=139.76s)]
*  I spoke to people, detainees that were there unlawfully and spent quite a long time there [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=141.32s)]
*  and see what their experience was like there, because I was in the end, like, a very privileged [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=147.84s)]
*  refugee. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=152.24s)]
*  I came as a refugee to America and asylee to America. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=153.24s)]
*  But also, you know, someone always has it much worse than you do. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=156.84s)]
*  And just hearing their stories is really quite jarring, you know. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=160.56s)]
*  And it's something that I definitely wanted to cover within the series and something I [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=164.56s)]
*  wanted to shed light on it, but more so peek into it and get to know the characters a lot [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=168.84s)]
*  more because I think usually you hear like, oh, there's immigrants and asylees and you [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=173.08s)]
*  see these images on news programs and you don't really know the people at all. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=177.76s)]
*  You don't know the background. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=183.0s)]
*  You don't know their stories. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=184.0s)]
*  You know what it actually even takes to become a citizen. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=185.0s)]
*  You think you just show up to America and they're just passing out green cards. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=187.32s)]
*  Here you go, baby. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=189.88s)]
*  You know, it's not how it goes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=190.88s)]
*  It's really a long, difficult and very sloppy process, quite frankly. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  And so, yeah, that's something that I've known for quite some time and immigrants and asylees [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=197.56s)]
*  in America know it as well. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=202.24s)]
*  And I was just, you know, after 26 years of doing professional stand-up, somebody finally [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  had the courage to tell the story. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=208.82s)]
*  Charles, can I ask you what you think of sort of the power of the image, not just in terms [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=211.48s)]
*  of the representation that comes from a show like yours, Mo, but also, you know, the images [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  we saw of the mayor of Newark arrested in front of an ICE detention center just the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=221.84s)]
*  other day, the image of Rumeysa Ozturk taken off the street. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  What they signal about the law enforcement apparatus in this country and what the administration [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=232.12s)]
*  also might mean in some cases creating some of these images and disseminating them. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=238.32s)]
*  Well, Tony, I think a lot of it really boils down to fundamentally how we are going to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=243.08s)]
*  define what it is to be America and American going forward. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=248.24s)]
*  The expectation that the processes, the apparatus that exists that we so ardently and fervently [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=253.0s)]
*  lean into as to what it is to define America is being challenged. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=258.76s)]
*  And I think that Rosmaraca, for example, being there in his presence and challenging that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=263.88s)]
*  by law is an example of what this moment calls for, for people who are going to be truthseekers [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=268.32s)]
*  and truth tellers to lean on what the law says in terms of what we should be able to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  do, what we're supposed to be able to do and to challenge these systems when they're [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=278.84s)]
*  not working for us the way that they are supposed to. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  That is going to need to be done more if we're going to fight things that are going to reach [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=285.67999999999995s)]
*  or trying to reshape America as we know it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=292.32s)]
*  And that's why it's so critically important beyond the law, beyond what's actually going [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=294.96s)]
*  to happen if Rosmaraca is ever actually prosecuted. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  The fact that there is the need to challenge this and to see that these systems have to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=302.29999999999995s)]
*  be pushed back on in this moment is what's critically most important. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=306.92s)]
*  But it seems like the legal environment may be shifting somewhat here. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=309.71999999999997s)]
*  We actually had the students lawyer, many of these students who have been detained on [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=313.6s)]
*  last week, I think it was, it feels like a million years ago. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=318.08s)]
*  And Ramzi Kassam, the lawyer, talked about how attorneys are learning and adapting to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=321.52s)]
*  what they're learning about how ISIS is treating things, how these immigration courts are responding [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=329.68s)]
*  to their arguments. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=334.4s)]
*  That might be part of the reason why Ramesa was able to get out because they're learning [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=335.4s)]
*  and adapting. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  But then you have Stephen Miller out there talking about how they're potentially going [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  to suspend habeas corpus. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=344.84s)]
*  Do you think that is a response to lawyers getting smarter and figuring out how to better [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=346.2s)]
*  use the system to the advantage of their wrongly detained clients? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  Make no mistake about it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  America's future rests in the hands of the judiciary. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=360.12s)]
*  I've been saying this for a while because in order for Congress to legislate its way [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=363.36s)]
*  around this, you're looking at a house that is basically inept in terms of its ability [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=367.96s)]
*  to get things done with Mike Johnson leading the ship over there and they're beholden to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=372.48s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=377.88s)]
*  The judiciary does not necessarily have those constraints. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=378.88s)]
*  And that's why when you're looking at venue shopping, federal courts in different circuits [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=382.32s)]
*  and how people are approaching this strategically, you're seeing that as a very, very viable [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=387.0s)]
*  way to try and push back. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=392.28s)]
*  Stephen Miller understands this. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=393.96s)]
*  The Trump administration understands this, which is why you've seen such a strong attack [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=395.11999999999995s)]
*  on the judiciary, because they understand that this is more likely than not the biggest [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=399.0s)]
*  obstacle that they have for accomplishing their agenda. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=403.76s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=406.55999999999995s)]
*  This is a response to that because they know if anyone can stop us, it's going to be the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=407.55999999999995s)]
*  courts. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=411.96s)]
*  Mo, let me just real quick. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=412.96s)]
*  I'm a comedian. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=414.96s)]
*  I'm an observer. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=415.96s)]
*  I don't really just just looking outside. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=416.96s)]
*  I'm just thinking like how you say like lawyers are learning on the fly and go for it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=419.88s)]
*  But how do you combat lawlessness? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=425.84s)]
*  How do you combat a complete disregard for the law? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=428.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I don't mean to laugh about it, but it's just kind of wild. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  This poor woman is walking down the street. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=436.21999999999997s)]
*  She's talking to her mother. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=438.32s)]
*  There's somebody in plain clothes. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=439.32s)]
*  You don't even know if he's a cop or not a cop or police officer or not. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=440.79999999999995s)]
*  And he has no right to actually detain her. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=443.67999999999995s)]
*  There's no actual proof or evidence that she did any criminal act whatsoever. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=445.76s)]
*  She wrote an academic essay. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=449.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=451.76s)]
*  And she gets arrested. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=452.76s)]
*  It's not funny. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=453.76s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=454.76s)]
*  I'm laughing because of these reasons because it just you can't help it but just kind of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=455.76s)]
*  want to push those feelings aside. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=459.15999999999997s)]
*  But anyway, yeah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=461.56s)]
*  So how do you combat that? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=462.56s)]
*  You say like lawyers are learning on the fly. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=463.56s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=464.76s)]
*  You're just making up stuff and just executive order this and executive order that and pick [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  up this person, pick up that person. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=472.59999999999997s)]
*  You have children in court having to, you know, defend themselves in court. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=474.08s)]
*  Four year olds. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=479.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=480.08s)]
*  Well, the Trump administration took away their right to pro bono representation and a judge [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=481.08s)]
*  said no, you have to restore it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=487.96s)]
*  They are required to give these, you know, access to lawyers to these four year old kids [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=490.12s)]
*  in some cases. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=495.44s)]
*  And the Trump administration has not complied with that order. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=496.44s)]
*  To your point. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=499.52s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=500.52s)]
*  They're all sitting there with headphones terrified away from their parents trying to [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=501.96s)]
*  talk about their conditions, trying to defend themselves in court. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=505.12s)]
*  Let me ask you about what you just brought up because I think it cuts to something deeper [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=507.84s)]
*  here which is the idea of the notion of free speech and to some extent self censorship. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=510.76s)]
*  You rightfully pointed out Ramesa was just writing an essay. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=516.16s)]
*  You know, others may have participated in more activity. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=519.28s)]
*  But if you just take that idea that somebody is ultimately being detained and disappeared [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=521.4s)]
*  for their rights to speak. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=527.24s)]
*  You write, you speak, does that give you a chilling effect? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=530.64s)]
*  You're obviously way more hard profile than any of the people that have been detained. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  But I'm just curious to know whether that fear affects you as well. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm an artist. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=541.2800000000001s)]
*  You know, I don't operate from a place of fear to be honest. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=542.2800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=544.44s)]
*  You know, I don't really think that way. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=545.44s)]
*  I think about is, you know, stand up comedy is always been an art form that makes you [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=546.44s)]
*  laugh and make you think, you know, you have to definitely make the audience laugh. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=553.12s)]
*  But you definitely if you can add that other sophisticated layer of thought, then you've [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=556.88s)]
*  really created something special. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=561.36s)]
*  So you can't operate from a place of fear in that way. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=563.2s)]
*  Some things feel dangerous. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=566.32s)]
*  Some things feel scary to talk about on stage. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=568.12s)]
*  But the more so the better I feel because these conversations need to happen. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  And as comedians in particular, they're always like speaking truth to power as part of that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=575.96s)]
*  art form in particular. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, that's why, you know, the I'm blanking right now. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=581.32s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=585.6s)]
*  Every year, once a year, they usually have the president was that they're in a White [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=587.48s)]
*  House correspondence dinner. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=590.36s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=591.36s)]
*  There'll be a comedian there. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=592.36s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=593.36s)]
*  Roast the president. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=594.36s)]
*  That's part of the process usually. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=595.36s)]
*  But that's what it is. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=597.12s)]
*  That's the essence of the art form. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=598.12s)]
*  But I don't think that way. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=599.5600000000001s)]
*  I think that once you do so, then your art form itself starts to be watered down a bit. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=600.84s)]
*  Charles Coleman, Jr. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=606.24s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=607.64s)]
*  Thanks, Charles. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=608.64s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=609.64s)]
*  Mo, don't go anywhere. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=610.64s)]
*  We're going to get our money's worth out of you. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=611.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=613.64s)]
*  You're not going anywhere. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=614.64s)]
*  I'm exhausted, guys. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=615.68s)]
*  Let me out. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=616.68s)]
*  No, I was on a watch list downstairs. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=617.68s)]
*  Was that Trump, too? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=618.68s)]
*  I think. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=619.68s)]
*  I think. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8RGwHMXbg&t=620.68s)]
