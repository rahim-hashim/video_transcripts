# Dan Bongino may be leaving FBI after clash with AG Pam Bondi
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc)
*  We have some news breaking on the story we brought you at the top of the hour, the turmoil [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=0.0s)]
*  atop the FBI. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=4.96s)]
*  Two sources familiar with the matter are telling NBC News that Deputy Director of the FBI, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=6.88s)]
*  Dan Bongino, may be leaving his job after a heated confrontation with Attorney General [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=11.96s)]
*  Pam Bondi over his frustration with how the Justice Department has handled the Jeffrey [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Epstein files. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=22.56s)]
*  As we reported earlier, Bongino did not come to work today after a heated argument with [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=24.12s)]
*  Pam Bondi Wednesday. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=28.94s)]
*  Joining us now is my colleague, NBC News White House correspondent, Vaughn Hilliard. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=30.98s)]
*  Also joining us, host of MSNBC's Politics Nation, president of the National Action Network, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=35.46s)]
*  the Reverend Al Sharpton is here as well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=40.54s)]
*  Vaughn, let me read from what you and our colleague, Kendall Lanean, are reporting. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  Bongino did not report to work today amid speculation about his whereabouts, the sources [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  said. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=51.22s)]
*  It came after a heated confrontation Wednesday at a meeting with Pam Bondi and White House [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=52.22s)]
*  Chief of Staff, Suzy Wiles, during which Bongino and FBI Director Cash Patel were asked about [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=56.379999999999995s)]
*  a news story suggesting they were dissatisfied with the decision not to release any additional [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=62.339999999999996s)]
*  Epstein files, the sources said. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=67.62s)]
*  The meeting was first reported by Axios. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=69.89999999999999s)]
*  Take me inside what the suspicion is that Patel and Bongino leaked. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=74.2s)]
*  The irony of the polygraph story we started our broadcast with and you're reporting just [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=83.18s)]
*  now is that Bondi and Wiles seem frustrated that Bongino and Patel have gone public with [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=88.10000000000001s)]
*  their discontent. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=95.14000000000001s)]
*  And I think in large part it's because of the pressure that Cash Patel and Dan Bongino [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=97.02000000000001s)]
*  have placed upon themselves, Nicole. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=101.34s)]
*  We have covered the litany of promises that those two men, upon taking their FBI posts, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=103.7s)]
*  to the American population that they were going to investigate and reveal everything [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=110.1s)]
*  about Jeffrey Epstein, about the January 6 committee and its investigation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=114.78s)]
*  They were going to investigate and reveal who the pipe bomber was. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=121.86s)]
*  They were going to investigate the 2020 election. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  And yet we're seven months in now and they have come up with effectively nothing on those [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=129.06s)]
*  fronts here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=134.2s)]
*  And that is where I am told, along with our colleague, Kendall Ania and Monica Alba, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=135.38s)]
*  that these two men were frustrated by the feeling that they have been stifled by Attorney [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=140.18s)]
*  General Pam Bondi. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=145.46s)]
*  Now to the extent that that is reality and to the extent that the Attorney General is [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=147.06s)]
*  acting as a shield or actually putting some parameters around their work and their investigations [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=151.32s)]
*  and the basis into them, I think that is the question that each of us are going to have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=157.26s)]
*  in our reporting here in the days ahead. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  But these two men, I'm told that Dan Bongino is considering resigning from his post. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=163.7s)]
*  Cash Patel has not gone as far as to suggest that, but will be looking, I'm told, at how [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=168.78s)]
*  Dan Bongino responds to this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=173.98s)]
*  I'm told that both men meet with the Attorney General on a daily basis and that they have [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=176.42s)]
*  not kept their displeasures hidden from her. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=181.62s)]
*  I know that Pam Bondi was at the White House one week ago. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=184.45999999999998s)]
*  They have continued the White House to stand behind her as the Attorney General. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=186.82s)]
*  At some point in time, though, this is going to come to a head and it may be here in real [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=191.32s)]
*  time. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=196.04s)]
*  I mean, Bon, let me just sift through some of this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=197.04s)]
*  I mean, they put pressure on themselves. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=202.84s)]
*  I mean, these things are not facts. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=203.84s)]
*  What kind of pressure do they put on themselves? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=205.16s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=207.04s)]
*  Dan Bongino, right, and he could leave this job and go back to a podcast that undoubtedly [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=208.04s)]
*  made him a lot of money. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  He had millions of people that would tune in, hundreds of thousands, depending on which [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=214.54s)]
*  episode you're watching. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=219.04s)]
*  For him, dating back to 2022, 2023, you go back to the archives and he became popular [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=221.28s)]
*  in large part, especially Cash Patel as well. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=228.28s)]
*  They made money off of these conspiracy theories and saying that they needed to get Donald [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=230.96s)]
*  Trump back into office. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=235.12s)]
*  They kept this idea that if they were in the position of the FBI, they would dismantle [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  it, they would reform it, they'd get the corruption out of the FBI, they'd get the longtime prosecutors [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=241.4s)]
*  out of there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=246.98000000000002s)]
*  You've had these very conversations. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=247.98000000000002s)]
*  To a large extent, they have upheld the promise of getting rid of top officials that have [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=250.12s)]
*  worked inside of the agency. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=254.84s)]
*  But when it comes to proving the things that they made money off of for a number of years [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=257.96s)]
*  now, the things that not only they made money off of, but ultimately put them in the position [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=263.16s)]
*  of power, now is the time to serve up the evidence. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=266.9s)]
*  So far, they haven't been able to do that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=270.8s)]
*  I mean, Bongino didn't make enough money to buy t-shirts that fit. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=273.12s)]
*  Von, what is the—I mean, so Bongino feels like there's more, and he wants more of the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=277.12s)]
*  Epstein files released. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=284.68s)]
*  I mean, that seems like an absolutely catastrophic outcome. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=285.68s)]
*  I never thought I'd say this, but Donald Trump better hope that damn Bongino doesn't leave [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=289.48s)]
*  and go back to his podcast where he made millions of dollars attacking the FBI, because his [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=295.08s)]
*  base is about to absolutely spill over, and whatever toxic brew is inside there is about [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=299.56s)]
*  to come spilling out if he leaves of the Epstein files. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=306.6s)]
*  I mean, what is the degree of alarm from the folks that will be left holding the bag? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=309.52s)]
*  Okay, I think that's the part, Nicole, that I think that folks need to understand here, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=314.16s)]
*  is that they have gotten severe pushback from MAGA Worlds and their base for not providing [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=319.4s)]
*  everything on Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=327.4s)]
*  And so in response, they really only have one choice, if you're looking at this in some [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=329.36s)]
*  strategical ballgame sense, and that is to effectively shift the blame to somebody else. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's Attorney General Pam Bondi. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=340.04s)]
*  And Pam Bondi hasn't done herself any good by handing out those binders to those social [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=342.20000000000005s)]
*  media right-wing influencers a couple months ago that ended up having nothing in them. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=346.52000000000004s)]
*  Look at Laura Loomer has suddenly become a voice of, you know, demanding transparency, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=350.64000000000004s)]
*  right? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, we know the conspiracy theories that she has continually spewed and spread, and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=357.20000000000005s)]
*  she's vile in the way that she describes or calls other people that she perceives as [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=363.2s)]
*  political opponents. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=370.0s)]
*  But the one thing that she does have going for her is the argument that MAGA has the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=371.47999999999996s)]
*  obligation to uphold to the ideas of the transparency that for the last years they claimed that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  they would bring if Donald Trump came back into office. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=382.44s)]
*  My head's about to explode. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=384.52s)]
*  I wish so badly that I didn't care about facts, because this would be so much more fun. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=386.48s)]
*  Is it—I mean, what is the fact that Laura Loomer's on the side of the truth? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  And Pam, I mean, is Donald Trump's name as—what's his face? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=396.0s)]
*  Elon Musk said? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=401.0s)]
*  Is there a belief among MAGA that Trump's name is in the Epstein files? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=402.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you're saying that Laura Loomer is on the side of transparency. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=407.04s)]
*  Bondi is covering it up. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=411.32s)]
*  What is—what do they believe Bondi's covering up, Von? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=412.32s)]
*  They believe that there is a pedophile ring that is going to implicate a ton of other [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=416.24s)]
*  people. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=422.44s)]
*  This goes back to QAnon conspiracy theories, right? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=423.44s)]
*  Donald Trump, for this part, there is still this idea that somehow he is the one that [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=425.4s)]
*  was ultimately going to bring this ring to an end. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=430.92s)]
*  I know that we know the facts completely run counter to that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=434.08s)]
*  We know that the two men had a relationship. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=437.62s)]
*  Donald Trump has acknowledged it himself. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=439.4s)]
*  But I think that this is where you go to—if you get into the real deep crevices of, you [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=442.44s)]
*  know, the MAGA population of America here, I mean, I think it would take a long time [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=448.52s)]
*  to really dissect just how far and how deep this goes in the belief that these other people [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=452.68s)]
*  are going to be implicated. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9D3s33Xoc&t=458.16s)]
