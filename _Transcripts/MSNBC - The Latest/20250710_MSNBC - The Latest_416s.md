# At least 120 dead, more than 170 missing after Texas flood
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g)
*  Because as the sun rises over central Texas today, residents are still grieving the loss [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=0.0s)]
*  of at least 120 people across six counties after storms surged through the region nearly one week [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=4.24s)]
*  ago. A desperate search by air, water, land and even horseback continues at this hour. As officials [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=10.32s)]
*  say, more than 170 people are still missing. That number includes five campers and one counselor [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=15.92s)]
*  from the beloved Camp Mystic, where more heartbreaking stories of loss are revealed with each passing day. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=21.52s)]
*  They include eight-year-old camper Mary Kate Jacoby. Her family says she entered the gates of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=26.8s)]
*  heaven, adding she was tiny but mighty and full of love. Today, questions continue about whether [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  more could have been done to warn residents ahead of those catastrophic floods. At a press [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=36.8s)]
*  conference yesterday, local officials defended their response and said those questions about [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=41.44s)]
*  how they handled it will be answered in time. I believe those questions need to be answered to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=45.6s)]
*  the family, the missed loved ones, to the public. We're not running, we're not going to hide from [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  anything. That's going to be checked into at a later time. I wish I could tell you that time. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=55.36s)]
*  Folks, I don't know how many lives our KPD team saved in an hour in Kerrville, but I know that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=59.44s)]
*  this tragedy, as horrific as it is, could have been so much worse. This comes as new reporting [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=67.44s)]
*  from NBC News revealed that the former Kerr County Commissioner described the county's flood warning [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=76.24s)]
*  system as antiquated all the way back in 2016 and that Kerr County officials then discussed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=80.88s)]
*  warning systems more than two dozen times since then. NBC News correspondent Priscilla Thompson [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=86.0s)]
*  has the latest for us from the ground in Kerrville. Priscilla? Yeah, right now the search for the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=90.96s)]
*  missing is continuing to grow more urgent and more desperate with each passing day. We know [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=96.64s)]
*  that officials have said that they have some very heavy machinery out here as they are trying to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=101.84s)]
*  work their way through this very large debris. You have large trees that are down. You have vehicles [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=106.16s)]
*  that were pulled in to the river, also pieces of homes, according to officials. And so they are [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  urging the volunteers who are out here who want to help the people who are searching to continue to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  do so, but not in the areas where they see that heavy machinery, because they are trying to handle [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=121.84s)]
*  these areas obviously very delicately in case they're recovering remains or perhaps there is [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=126.72s)]
*  the miracle that they will find someone still who is alive. But I will tell you, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=132.56s)]
*  officials have said that they have not pulled anyone out alive since Friday. Meanwhile, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=136.8s)]
*  you also have the governor overnight releasing his priorities for the special session, which is set [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  to begin later this month. And that, of course, at the top of that list are all of these issues [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=148.24s)]
*  around flooding. That includes flood warning systems, flood emergency communication, relief [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=154.08s)]
*  funding for this Hill Country area and these floods, and also natural disaster preparation [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=160.24s)]
*  and recovery. And officials are continuing to be pressed about this response and whether or not [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=165.68s)]
*  they acted appropriately in the hours as these floodwaters were coming in. But officials still [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=171.28s)]
*  not answering specifically many of these questions, only saying that right now their focus remains [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=176.16s)]
*  on so many of those people who are still missing. NBC's Priscilla Thompson, thank you for your [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  updates. And elsewhere in the Southwest, at least three people have died after flash floods swept [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=189.2s)]
*  through the mountain region, mountain village of Rio Doce, New Mexico. Video shows broken trees, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=193.92s)]
*  destroyed homes and muddy debris as rescue crews worked to clean the wreckage. Officials say a [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  four-year-old girl, a seven-year-old boy and a man aged 40 to 50 were the victims of yesterday's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=204.56s)]
*  flood. Four people in the community there remain missing. Rio Doce, though, is no stranger to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=210.0s)]
*  natural disasters. Wildfires raged through the area last year, leaving burns scar in the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=215.36s)]
*  hillsides and canyons that was then unable to absorb much of Tuesday's rainfall. A lot of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=219.84s)]
*  weather happening around the country that we're tracking. White House reporter for The Wall Street [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=225.44000000000003s)]
*  Journal Ken Thomas is joining us now, and it's at the nexus of politics and those natural disasters [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=229.12s)]
*  that we should start this morning because the president is set to go tomorrow, I believe, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=234.8s)]
*  with the first lady to tour that damage in Texas. What do you imagine that is going to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=238.72000000000003s)]
*  look like? We've seen some controversial trips from him before to people who are struggling in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=245.04s)]
*  the aftermath of natural disasters. Yeah, I think this trip will be something that we've seen before. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=249.76s)]
*  He will, you know, we're expecting him to go to Texas, meet with family members, get a briefing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=255.04s)]
*  from local officials there. I'm sure he will meet with Texas Governor Greg Abbott. You know, he has [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=262.8s)]
*  very good relationships with people in Texas. These are political allies of his, but I think [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=268.56s)]
*  what's different about this trip is that he has talked about phasing out FEMA and this idea that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=274.0s)]
*  the federal government should not have a large role in handling these kinds of disasters in the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=280.88s)]
*  future. And I think this case, and you know, we could see in other cases in the future, is just, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=287.68s)]
*  you know, how well can states really respond to these kinds of incidents? You know, there's been [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=295.04s)]
*  concerns about a lack of a warning system, you know, as this terrible storm came through. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=300.88s)]
*  Is that something that a state can really do on its own, or is this just one of those functions that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=307.04s)]
*  you need the federal government to provide that kind of leadership? I mean, so much of what [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  FEMA does in the aftermath of a storm is to flood the zone with money, but also coordination. It's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=317.2s)]
*  a huge effort to coordinate all of these responses. It's overwhelming for governors, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=324.8s)]
*  for local officials on the ground when these storms happen. And so, you know, is this something [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=332.8s)]
*  really that a state can do on its own? And keep in mind, you know, this is the start of hurricane [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=339.12s)]
*  season. We don't know what is ahead. You know, are we going to have other states, you know, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=344.8s)]
*  in the southeast that may have to deal with a massive hurricane and a recovery? So I think [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=351.04s)]
*  this really just raises questions of whether we can really phase out FEMA like this administration [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=356.24s)]
*  has been talking about, or are we going to have to basically do what we've done in the past, which is [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=362.0s)]
*  maintain a federal presence? Yeah, I think that that's one of the central questions here, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=366.32000000000005s)]
*  because you're right. Trump is going to a place where he has political allies that shouldn't [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=370.08000000000004s)]
*  really be a part of this conversation, and yet I think you're right to point it out. So the open [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=373.76s)]
*  question, as he talks about phasing out FEMA and the timing again, so important, the start of hurricane [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=377.84s)]
*  season, all of that is really going to come into play. And it'll test whether this is an administration [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=382.64s)]
*  that can take in new information that might not jive with what it initially was trying to do [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=386.79999999999995s)]
*  policy-wise. Will they change course? I mean, we'll ultimately end up seeing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=391.52s)]
