# 'Real Housewives of the White House': Trump-Musk feud in public view
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY)
*  And we are witnessing a beltway bromance blowing up in epic proportion all over Trump's big, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=0.0s)]
*  beautiful bill. President Trump and Elon Musk's political partnership has completely crumbled in [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=7.2s)]
*  public view over the past 24 hours. First, it was Musk's complaints about the Republican [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=12.72s)]
*  mega bill that turned into a campaign to tank it altogether, which led the president to say this [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  about his billionaire backer on Thursday. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=24.8s)]
*  But I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=26.96s)]
*  and he hasn't said bad about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=34.08s)]
*  And this is what happened next. Musk unleashing in at least 42 ex-posts. President Trump responding [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=38.64s)]
*  on truth social, threatening to cut Musk's government contracts worth billions. As Trump [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  allies called for investigations into Musk. Musk called for impeachment. As Republicans watched in [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=52.56s)]
*  horror, Democrats got out the popcorn. And a behind the scenes scramble to get the two most [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=58.24s)]
*  powerful and volatile men in the world to deescalate so far has fallen short. Let's bring in NBC News [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=63.92s)]
*  senior national politics reporter Jonathan Allen and MSNBC senior Washington correspondent and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=70.88s)]
*  co-host of the weekend, Eugene Daniels. John, bring us the latest White House view on this. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  Any movement toward a truce this morning? Yeah, we're hearing from White House officials, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=82.32s)]
*  Kristen Welker, the host of Meet the Press, and I've been speaking to White House officials [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=87.44s)]
*  this morning. What we've heard is that there are no plans for Trump to call Musk or to talk to Musk [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=91.28s)]
*  on the phone today. Of course, that could always change. But a White House official telling [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Kristen that there is a desire on the part at least of Trump's staff to deescalate this situation. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=102.72s)]
*  And Caroline Levitt, the White House press secretary, told me that when the president [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  left the White House yesterday, he was focused on his one big, beautiful bill, which of course [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=114.24s)]
*  could be the casualty here if Musk gets the upper hand. But I think we've got Caroline Levitt on [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=118.72s)]
*  Hannity yesterday. Let's listen to what she has to say. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=125.36s)]
*  The president's focus and the focus of the entire White House remains on passing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=130.8s)]
*  the one big, beautiful bill. And as your audience just saw on Friday, just days ago, the president [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=135.44s)]
*  graciously hosted Elon Musk in the Oval Office, and Elon thanked the president for his incredible [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=141.04s)]
*  leadership. The only difference between Friday and today is Elon went back to his companies, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=146.4s)]
*  and as a businessman, he has a right to speak for his companies. But as president, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=150.88s)]
*  President Trump has a responsibility to fight for this country. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=155.76s)]
*  And so obviously you could see the difference between the interests that Caroline Levitt was [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=160.56s)]
*  laying out there, and for a long time these men's interests coincided. Now they are obviously [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=165.68s)]
*  colliding, as you said, on an epic proportion. Eugene, the White House press secretary seemed [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=171.2s)]
*  to suggest there, at least how I interpret it, that this is all normal. Now he's a business guy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=177.12s)]
*  President Trump's the president. I mean, come on. Is this the type of fight you'd expect [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=182.32s)]
*  between a businessman and a president? Between these two, it is, right? I think [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=186.48s)]
*  that's normal. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=193.44s)]
*  That's normal anymore. The thing about this relationship is it was always built on [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  no loyalty, right? It wasn't built on a policy prescription that the two men [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=203.52s)]
*  really liked together. It was about what they could get from each other. And at this point, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=207.36s)]
*  it seems like Elon has decided that he's not getting anything, right? She kind of gave away [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=211.12s)]
*  the game there. It sounds like they heard that when Elon got and looked at the numbers, finally [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=217.44s)]
*  got to really sit down and talk to the Tesla people and said that, oh, things are as bad as [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=221.6s)]
*  we were talking about them on television, then that made it very clear to him that, oh, I have [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=226.0s)]
*  to say something. I will also say it has exposed a lot of rifts, right, and not just the rift [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=230.48s)]
*  between these two men, but a rift between the tech bros and the MAGA base, which has happened [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  before earlier this year, the rift between people who really care about fiscal responsibility in the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=240.4s)]
*  Republican Party and people who really love what Donald Trump is doing, right? So it's going to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=248.32s)]
*  make the road to passing this bill not just hard in the Senate, but re-passing it in the House even [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=254.56s)]
*  harder. John, you write about collateral damage, and I think Eugene is hinting at that. Talk to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=259.52s)]
*  us about what that collateral damage could look like. Well, for the president, obviously, the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=265.44s)]
*  future of this bill is at risk in the short term. In the longer term for the Republican Party, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=271.76s)]
*  Musk is threatening not only to withhold the $100 million that he had promised to put into Trump [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=276.64s)]
*  political committees—in fact, we were told by one source close to Musk yesterday that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=283.2s)]
*  that's already gone, that's not going to happen—but that Musk could actually spend [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=288.0s)]
*  to defeat Republican candidates. And Musk said in November, meaning potentially giving to Democrats, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=292.4s)]
*  or at least trying to harm Republicans on the ballot if they vote for this bill. For Musk, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  of course, he's got billions of dollars wrapped up in federal subsidies for his companies. We've [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=303.92s)]
*  already seen Tesla take a huge nosedive. I think it lost about 14 percent of its stock value yesterday. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=309.04s)]
*  So a lot of money at stake for Elon Musk and the political legacy of Donald Trump, whose entire [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=315.6s)]
*  first term or second term, I guess, now agenda is wrapped up in this big, beautiful bill. A lot at [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  stake for both of these men, and if they can't come to an agreement here, you could really see [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  a permanent fissure in the Republican Party. Yeah, that stock hit you mentioned for Tesla [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=333.6s)]
*  amounted to about $150 billion that was gone. Now it seems like Tesla's doing a little better today. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=337.36s)]
*  But Eugene, are there any signs that this opposition from Musk will actually lead to more GOP no votes [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  on the president's mega bill? Does it give Republicans cover if they don't like it? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  I think it does. We saw this before when they talked about raising the debt ceiling and all [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=354.72s)]
*  of that during the end of the Biden term. As soon as Elon Musk came out against it, you saw [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=360.08s)]
*  Donald Trump as candidate and also other Republicans feel like they could say something and come out [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  very hard and publicly against it. I think it also just comes as you're looking at people [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=372.64s)]
*  like Marjorie Taylor Greene who say, I didn't read the whole bill, and I don't like that you can't. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=377.28s)]
*  This strips the ability for states to have AI regulation. Other members, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=382.64s)]
*  other folks in the Republican circle saying, I didn't read the bill, but now. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  And so it comes at this interesting time. It's hard to understand the chicken or the egg here, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=391.68s)]
*  but I think it does provide them cover. Elon Musk is going to continue to tweet about this, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=397.36s)]
*  to X about this, and Donald Trump is going to continue to social post about it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think the thing that Donald Trump is realizing is strange bedfellows are great [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=407.36s)]
*  until they're too strange. And now you have the richest man in the world who has the biggest [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=413.76s)]
*  platform, maybe a platform that is as big as Donald Trump's ability to get as much attention [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=420.24s)]
*  as Donald Trump, and he's against you loudly, publicly, and very personally. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=425.44s)]
*  But President Trump is still the president and some of his allies like Steve Bannon are swinging [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  for the fences here. John, he's urging the president to investigate Musk for alleged drug [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=438.48s)]
*  use for his immigration status, for his ties to China. What do you think? Would President Trump [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=445.44s)]
*  go there? I mean, it's certainly not outside the realm of possibility. We haven't gotten any [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=451.44s)]
*  indication yet from the White House that that is something that will be undertaken. I guess we'll [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=458.72s)]
*  have to see whether this continues to escalate. But it's interesting. Steve spoke to Christian [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=463.44s)]
*  Walker yesterday, and we couldn't even print some of the things that he said because they were so [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=470.71999999999997s)]
*  ratcheted up and they were so, I guess, uneasy to confirm or difficult to confirm. But certainly, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=475.76s)]
*  Bannon has a voice in that MAGA movement, and we have seen that the movement has been able to [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=485.84s)]
*  pressure the president into doing things in the past, so I would not rule it out. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=491.28s)]
*  I'm just looking to see, is there anything more we're hearing from these two men this morning? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=496.88s)]
*  It's been interesting to see how quiet the social media has been on both X and true social from [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=500.96s)]
*  both President Trump and Elon Musk so far this morning. Eugene, Democrats have been kind of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=509.28s)]
*  sitting back watching from the sidelines with glee. One Democratic party operative telling NBC News, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=514.72s)]
*  this is Christmas. But I do wonder, substantively or quantifiably, what does this do for Democrats? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=520.72s)]
*  Not much. It causes a rift within the Republican Party. We'll talk about it for a few days, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=528.32s)]
*  depending on whether or not President Trump does what Steve Bannon says he should be doing. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=535.6s)]
*  There might be some substantive stuff there. But I think I was talking to a Democrat today that said [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=540.64s)]
*  they don't need to be distracted. This is still a bill that they're against. They should still do [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=544.88s)]
*  all the things they were planning to do in order to try and at least expose those rifts even more, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=550.24s)]
*  take advantage of this fight, but not get distracted by the real housewives of the [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=556.24s)]
*  White House kind of thing that's happening. You don't need Andy Cohen to do this. This is [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=562.7199999999999s)]
*  what leadership should be doing, what they're supposed to do, keeping everyone focused, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=566.64s)]
*  making sure that folks continue to take the fight to Donald Trump on this bill and kind of let the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=570.8s)]
*  Elon Musk of it all happen. John, if Musk goes nuclear, like one of his advisors told you and [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=576.88s)]
*  our colleagues, he could. And if he supports Democratic candidates, would Democrats accept [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  his money? I mean, is there risk that comes with that, especially after what we're seeing right now? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=591.12s)]
*  I mean, there's some risk that comes with that. I think what you'd be much more likely to see is [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=596.32s)]
*  money going into super PACs where it's not a Democratic candidate that has to accept the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=601.92s)]
*  money. And even more than that, it probably wouldn't even be ads that are advocating for [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=606.16s)]
*  a Democratic candidate, but rather against a Republican who voted for this bill. I mean, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=610.88s)]
*  we're a long way from that happening right now. I think the Democrats will take any support they [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=615.52s)]
*  can get, particularly if it doesn't tie them to Musk in any way that can be traced. So the way big [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  money works in politics now, if you're Elon Musk, you can affect elections without necessarily [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=627.28s)]
*  having to shake hands with people on the other side. I think what we have to watch now is whether [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=632.24s)]
*  the publicly professed ghosting of Elon Musk continues from the White House and vice versa. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=638.72s)]
*  We live in an unusual world where you tell the media that you're ghosting somebody. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=644.96s)]
*  I don't know what kind of world this is right now. Everything's just a mess. Jonathan Allen, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOZkyxo7fY&t=653.84s)]
