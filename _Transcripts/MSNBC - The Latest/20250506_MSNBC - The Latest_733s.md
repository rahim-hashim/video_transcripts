# Tariff Tensions: Trump, Canadian PM to meet today amid trade war
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A)
*  Okay, Garrett, both leaders there seem to be kind of coming to this meeting with some [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=0.0s)]
*  skepticism. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=5.04s)]
*  What is each country trying to get out of this? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=6.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a fair way to look at it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=8.44s)]
*  Look, for Mark Carney, he was elected in large measure as part of a backlash against President [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=10.92s)]
*  Trump in the way that the president has been talking about Canada and treating Canada in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=15.48s)]
*  the form of these tariffs. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=19.68s)]
*  Mark Carney has called it a betrayal. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=20.68s)]
*  But upon landing in D.C. yesterday, as you can see there, he posted something on X basically [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=22.88s)]
*  saying that America and Canada are stronger when we work together, and that's what he [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=27.64s)]
*  wants to get back to. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=30.8s)]
*  The president was right in his comments yesterday. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=32.36s)]
*  Carney wants a deal. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=34.32s)]
*  They want to get some kind of trade deal and get these tariffs on things like Canadian [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=35.32s)]
*  lumber and aluminum and steel and auto parts off the table. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=39.28s)]
*  As for the president, he has said a wide variety of comments about Canada, suggesting he wants [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=43.58s)]
*  to get rid of artificial economic borders between the two countries and maybe even the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=49.2s)]
*  borders altogether. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=53.22s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=54.22s)]
*  Are you also considering a military force to annex and acquire Canada? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=55.22s)]
*  No, economic force, because Canada and the United States, that would really be something. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=61.82s)]
*  You get rid of that artificially drawn line. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=68.9s)]
*  President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=71.82s)]
*  That will never, that will never ever happen. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=77.82s)]
*  Our old relationship, based on steadily increasing integration, is over. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=81.02s)]
*  It's hard to square all of it on us, so we will all find out together in the next hour [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=87.02s)]
*  and a half or so whether we get a more constructive meeting like what Mark Carney was suggesting [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=91.78s)]
*  or something else. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=95.97999999999999s)]
*  Brian, remind us, where exactly do the tariffs stand right now between these two countries [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=97.64s)]
*  and are we already seeing impacts because of them? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=102.36s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, we just got a fresh international trade and goods report from the Bureau of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  Economic Analysis, and they said that the trade deficit between the United States and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=109.84s)]
*  Canada was around $4.9 billion just in terms of goods. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  And you can imagine that as the administration has been talking about wanting to lower the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=116.64s)]
*  trade deficit and even provide a trade surplus in some cases to other countries, that's going [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  to be the measuring stick for the administration in terms of trying to even trade here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=124.42s)]
*  But I think as Garrett talked about, some of the major industries that are going to be [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  of focus here, the automotive industry, which is so deeply intertwined with American manufacturing, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  there's so many goods that cross the border just between Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=136.68s)]
*  Michigan. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=140.44s)]
*  Also, things like lumber. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=141.44s)]
*  I think a lot of people forget that there is currently a review from the Department [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=142.56s)]
*  of Commerce into whether or not they want to tariff lumber. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=146.0s)]
*  That would be a big deal for Canada, which exports a lot of lumber to the United States. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  And of course, steel and aluminum tariffs, which have been in effect, that 25 percent [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=152.6s)]
*  tariff, that is very much a big part of the conversation as well. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=156.28s)]
*  But broadly speaking, again, the story here is the United States has been front reloading [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  a lot of imports ahead of these tariffs in anticipation of that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=164.1s)]
*  This report reflects that the trade deficit widening, although interestingly, most of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=168.18s)]
*  that on an international basis was actually coming from pharmaceutical goods. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  So it suggests that maybe we weren't bringing in consumer goods like furniture, electronics, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=174.9s)]
*  as some may have thought. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=178.94s)]
*  That suggests that as long as these tariffs are prolonged longer than maybe companies [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=180.45999999999998s)]
*  were expecting, it could be more of a supply chain issue once we get closer to the holidays [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=183.94s)]
*  than even a pricing issue. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=188.26s)]
*  Yes, prices might rise if you can even find that item at the store, Anna. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=189.26s)]
*  And then there's, of course, the backlash in terms of the way people are behaving in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=193.42s)]
*  wanting to punish America. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=197.94s)]
*  If you are in Canada, Canadians, Catherine, have notably started shutting American products [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=200.01999999999998s)]
*  and foods. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=205.62s)]
*  We know McDonald's observed an uptick in anti-American sentiment abroad, particularly in Canada, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=206.62s)]
*  which could hurt their bottom line. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  Just how important is Canada when it comes to the U.S. economy? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=213.1s)]
*  Well, we are a much bigger share of Canada's trade than Canada is a share of our trade. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=218.1s)]
*  But there are some industries in the United States that are very sensitive to sentiment [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=225.86s)]
*  in Canada and resentment among Canadians against the United States. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=230.9s)]
*  Tourism is another great example of this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=236.78s)]
*  If you look at the data on trips planned by Canadians to the United States over the next [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=239.52s)]
*  few months, it has plummeted year over year. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=245.02s)]
*  And that's because a lot of Canadians, well, first of all, don't want to patronize the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=248.9s)]
*  United States after having been derided so much by Donald Trump, you know, that they [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=253.54000000000002s)]
*  should just be simply a province of our country. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=259.14s)]
*  But also because there's a lot of fear of what happens if you come here as a foreign [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  tourist, you know, having to register with the government if you're here for longer than [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=267.5s)]
*  these horror stories about people being detained at the border or otherwise mistreated. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=272.42s)]
*  So there's still a lot of tension between these two countries. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  And if you are, for example, a tourism-focused business in Florida, which attracts a lot [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  of Canadian snowbirds, that's going to be very painful for you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=286.6s)]
*  Many of the other kinds of commodities that Brian just laid out that Canada sells us, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=291.1s)]
*  lumber, steel, aluminum, auto parts, you know, lots of these kinds of products that we buy [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=297.54s)]
*  from them. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=302.90000000000003s)]
*  Yes, it'll hurt Canada. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  It will also hurt the United States. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=305.86s)]
*  You know, we're buying that lumber because we need it to buy homes. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=307.78000000000003s)]
*  We're buying their fossil fuels because we need it to heat our homes and run our factories [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=311.46000000000004s)]
*  and businesses. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  So no one's going to get out of this scot-free. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=318.04s)]
*  Here is the Commerce Secretary Howard Ludnick ahead of today's meeting. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=321.14000000000004s)]
*  What's going to happen to us? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=325.78s)]
*  They have been basically feeding off of us for decades upon decades upon decades, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=327.94s)]
*  They have their socialist regime, and it's basically feeding off of America. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=334.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, the president calls that out all the time. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=338.58s)]
*  Why do we make cars in Canada? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=340.9s)]
*  Why do we do our films in Canada? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=343.46s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=346.14s)]
*  So I think the president's going to have... [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=347.14s)]
*  I think it's going to be a fascinating meeting. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=348.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm glad I'm going to be there listening, but it's going to be a fascinating meeting tomorrow. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=350.65999999999997s)]
*  I just don't see how it works out so perfectly. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=354.21999999999997s)]
*  Brian, he claims that the U.S. has been getting ripped off for years, but let's remember, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=356.41999999999996s)]
*  President Trump negotiated the last trade deal with our neighbors, Canada and Mexico. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=362.26s)]
*  So where does this aboutface come from, and what could the U.S. potentially get out of [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=367.53999999999996s)]
*  some kind of new deal with Canada? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=372.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's the interesting rhetorical aspect of these negotiations between Canada [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=374.14s)]
*  but also with Mexico as well, where the Trump administration is trying to frame the United [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=378.94s)]
*  States as being ripped off, even though the current framework for trade between those [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=382.90000000000003s)]
*  three countries is the U.S. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=386.54s)]
*  MCA, which was negotiated during his first term. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=387.90000000000003s)]
*  Now, what's so interesting about the current tariffs that are putting in effect? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=390.86s)]
*  Let's take, for example, the automotive tariffs. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=393.90000000000003s)]
*  So there's an interesting provision inside the current tariffs that says any sort of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=395.90000000000003s)]
*  car part that comes, let's say, from Canada that is currently compliant with that framework [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=400.18s)]
*  that was negotiated on the first term, the U.S. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=404.58s)]
*  MCA, is not going to face a 25 percent tariff until the United States can figure out how [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=406.38s)]
*  much of that car part is not made in the United States. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=411.82s)]
*  So it's like an exemption. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=415.34000000000003s)]
*  It's like an asterisk to an asterisk, which suggests that the United States wants to scrap [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=416.66s)]
*  the entire U.S. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=421.14s)]
*  MCA and then maybe renegotiate a whole brand new trade agreement. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=421.82s)]
*  So, yes, there are these U.S. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=425.14s)]
*  MCA exemptions for some of these tariffs. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=426.7s)]
*  But again, the heavy suggestion here is that the U.S. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=429.5s)]
*  wants to scrap President Trump's own original negotiation agreement and create a brand new [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=431.7s)]
*  one. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=438.5s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=438.66s)]
*  We don't know, but you can imagine that meeting today between Mark Carney and President Trump [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=439.74s)]
*  will be kind of the first step in figuring out what that might look like. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=443.86s)]
*  And you'd point out just how kind of tangled everything is. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=446.22s)]
*  It is complicated. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=449.58000000000004s)]
*  It's not so simple. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=450.5s)]
*  Garrett, the White House just put out a release this morning touting National Small Business [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=451.38000000000005s)]
*  Week. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=455.42s)]
*  Even as small business owners keep saying that these tariffs will crush them. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=456.1s)]
*  Here's one from Minnesota. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=460.34000000000003s)]
*  I have maybe two months worth left in my warehouse in Minnesota. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=461.62s)]
*  And when that's gone, I have no more revenue. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=467.94s)]
*  I cannot pay my employees. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=471.62s)]
*  I cannot pay my bills. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=473.94s)]
*  I cannot pay the loans which I have leveraged my house against so we could lose our house. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=475.66s)]
*  I do not have the $230,000 that were just immediately dropped in front of me to get [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=482.82s)]
*  my products into the U.S. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=490.3s)]
*  Garrett, how is the White House planning to help this woman? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=492.5s)]
*  Are there plans? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=495.98s)]
*  The short answer is no. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=496.98s)]
*  The president's been clear that he's not going to put any exemptions in place for small businesses [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=498.94s)]
*  when it comes to the tariffs. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=503.06s)]
*  He was pressed about that by Kristen Welker over the weekend. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=504.06s)]
*  And it is a huge problem. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=506.58s)]
*  I've done so many of these stories. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=507.58s)]
*  The fear is that big businesses that have massive warehouses and the ability to take [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=509.02s)]
*  big quarterly losses if they have to can weather whatever uncertainty comes with the tariffs. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=514.14s)]
*  But smaller business owners like the woman you just saw there don't have the same cushion [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=519.06s)]
*  and they could ultimately get squashed. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=523.2199999999999s)]
*  Right now, the White House's line on this is that ultimately the tariffs they believe [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=525.2199999999999s)]
*  will make the entire economy stronger. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=529.0999999999999s)]
*  A rising tide lifts all boats, if you will, but so far no sign of that tide coming in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=531.0999999999999s)]
*  on it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=535.38s)]
*  Catherine, in theory, solidifying trade deals with allies like Canada, like the EU, should [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=536.38s)]
*  be easier. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=541.88s)]
*  But if Trump plays hardball and he drags this out, does that now give China more opening [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=543.14s)]
*  to fill the void? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=548.9399999999999s)]
*  I think that's a huge risk here. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=551.9s)]
*  Again, as we have discussed, Trump actually struck a deal in his first term with Canada, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=553.78s)]
*  with Mexico, the USMCA. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=559.9399999999999s)]
*  At the time, he said it was the greatest deal ever negotiated. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=561.5799999999999s)]
*  Now he's ripping that up. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=565.22s)]
*  So first of all, our allies cannot trust the United States and or Trump to keep our word [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=566.74s)]
*  if in fact we come to a deal. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=573.6999999999999s)]
*  And because we are alienating so many of our allies, we are in many ways emboldening China. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=577.62s)]
*  As viewers may recall, there was a meeting between an economic dialogue between China, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=583.9s)]
*  South Korea and Japan maybe about a month ago, their first economic dialogue in five [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=588.5s)]
*  years. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=593.46s)]
*  These three countries historically do not like each other very much for all sorts of [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=594.6s)]
*  reasons. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=599.02s)]
*  And Trump has driven them together. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=600.02s)]
*  He is driving many of our most important allies into the arms of China, which ostensibly [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=601.5s)]
*  we should be linking up with our allies if we have common interests in keeping China [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=608.18s)]
*  in line. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=613.22s)]
*  In some non-Canada economic developments, we've covered how President Trump has been [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=614.22s)]
*  saying people will need to buy fewer dolls potentially because of his economy. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=618.62s)]
*  But Brian, now we're hearing from Mattel, maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels, that they [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=623.22s)]
*  have suspended their 2025 guidance. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=628.0600000000001s)]
*  How significant is that? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=631.58s)]
*  Yeah, we're hearing from the doll companies directly now. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=632.74s)]
*  And as you mentioned, yes, there is that concern that they don't even have the ability to [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=635.34s)]
*  model out how much money they'll be making. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=640.22s)]
*  But from a consumer standpoint, they also said, interestingly, on that same earnings [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=641.98s)]
*  call that they'll take necessary where necessary, they'll take pricing action in their U.S. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=645.26s)]
*  business, meaning that they could raise prices for the dolls that are on the shelf. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=650.22s)]
*  But it's not just dolls. Hot Wheels as well. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=653.98s)]
*  Mattel makes a number of other toys. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=655.3000000000001s)]
*  But I think this underscores the real crux of that hundred forty five percent tariff [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=656.86s)]
*  that we're talking about specifically with China. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=661.2600000000001s)]
*  We don't import as many toys from Canada. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=663.0200000000001s)]
*  But when it comes to China, some estimates out there, 75 percent of toys that are imported [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=665.0200000000001s)]
*  into the United States come from China. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=668.7800000000001s)]
*  So what we're talking about here are Christmas gifts because the holidays are obviously a [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=670.34s)]
*  few months away. People aren't thinking about necessarily going to the store to buy early [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=675.86s)]
*  quite yet. But if you are a supplier, if you are a target or a retailer that's trying to [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=679.34s)]
*  have the shelves ready for, let's say, October, November, prime shopping season, you're ordering [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=683.3399999999999s)]
*  those things right now if you haven't already. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=688.5s)]
*  So I think the question here is when does the concern about the tariffs actually transcend [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=690.66s)]
*  the pricing aspect of it and even into a supply chain issue? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=695.62s)]
*  As I was kind of mentioning earlier, some of the data that we've been seeing suggests [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=698.5s)]
*  that actually maybe companies weren't front running as many of these consumer goods as [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=702.02s)]
*  we thought, meaning that the conversation is going to be more about is the item on the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=706.14s)]
*  shelf as opposed to how much is the item on the shelf going to increase in price. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBki1SvSi2A&t=709.82s)]
