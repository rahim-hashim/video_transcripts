Video Description: “Pride Puppy!” by Robin Stevenson is a rhyming alphabet book. With brightly colored illustrations, it tells the story of a puppy that gets lost during a Pride parade. “Pride Puppy!”, despite its cute premise and beautiful pictures, is at the center of a Supreme Court case happening right now. A small group of Maryland parents have sued over exposing their children to LGBTQ+ inclusive books like “Pride Puppy!” at their public school. As outlandish as it may seem to center a children’s book in such a high profile, so much is on the line for authors, for access to literature, and for families like the ones portrayed at Pride in this children’s book.

# Velshi Banned Book Club: “Pride Puppy!” by Robin Stevenson
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI)
*  I want to introduce you to a children's book called Pride Puppy by Robin Stevenson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a rhyming alphabet book. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=4.88s)]
*  A for awake, animals and all. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=7.0s)]
*  B for breakfast and baby and ball. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  C for car, our old Chevrolet. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=11.4s)]
*  D for dog, dressed up for the day. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=13.76s)]
*  Though brightly colored and detailed through brightly colored and detailed illustrations, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=16.84s)]
*  Pride Puppy tells the story of a family's puppy that gets lost at a pride parade. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=21.04s)]
*  I'm going to spoil the ending for you with the help of people celebrating pride, including [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  families with gay parents, children and a drag queen. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=29.68s)]
*  Things work out for the puppy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=33.68s)]
*  V for victory and holding on tight. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=35.4s)]
*  W for wags and wide smiles all around. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=37.68s)]
*  At the end of Pride Puppy, there's a suggested search and find word list for additional enrichment [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  and engagement with the story. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=45.84s)]
*  Pride Puppy is one of a number of children's and young adult titles embroiled in a Supreme [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  Court case happening right now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=51.78s)]
*  Mahmoud versus Taylor. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  And Pride Puppy is today's Velshi Van Book Club feature. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=55.44s)]
*  In November of 2022, the Montgomery County Board of Education in Maryland, the largest [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=58.5s)]
*  school system in the state, approved, quote, a handful of storybooks featuring lesbian, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=63.46s)]
*  gay, bisexual, transgender or queer characters for use in the language arts curriculum alongside [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=67.78s)]
*  the many books already in the curriculum that feature heterosexual characters in traditional [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=73.34s)]
*  gender roles, end quote. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=77.64s)]
*  At first, the administration gave parents advance notice when these storybooks were [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=79.9s)]
*  and have the opportunity to have their children removed from the lessons. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=84.5s)]
*  In March of 2023, the district no longer permitted the opt outs, quote, the growing number of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=88.78s)]
*  opt out requests gave rise to three related concerns. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=93.9s)]
*  High school high student absenteeism, the infeasibility of administering opt outs across [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=97.7s)]
*  classrooms and schools, and the risk of exposing students who believe the storybooks represent [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=103.26s)]
*  them and their families to social stigma and isolation, end quote. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=107.7s)]
*  The district also said too many of the opt out requests were not religious based. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=111.72s)]
*  A group of parents led by Tamer Mahmoud and Anas Barakat sued the Montgomery County School [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=116.28s)]
*  Board and Superintendent Thomas Taylor claiming their religious beliefs were being infringed [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=120.96s)]
*  upon. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=125.44s)]
*  Oral arguments in early March centered on Pride Puppy, specifically the L page, quote, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=126.44s)]
*  L for leash and for loose and for leaping. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=131.44s)]
*  So Pride Puppy was the book that was used for the pre-kindergarten curriculum. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=137.16s)]
*  That's the one where they are supposed to look for the leather and things and bondage [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  things like that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=146.2s)]
*  It's not bondage. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=147.2s)]
*  It's a woman and a leather sex worker. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=148.2s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=150.2s)]
*  Gosh, I read it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=153.2s)]
*  Drag queen and drag queen. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=155.2s)]
*  The leather that they're pointing to is a woman in a leather jacket. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=157.2s)]
*  And one of the words is drag queen in the search. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=161.2s)]
*  And they're supposed to look for those. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=163.2s)]
*  It is an option at the end of the book. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=165.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=168.2s)]
*  Members of the Velshi Band Book Club are all too familiar with the outsized number of LGBTQ [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=169.2s)]
*  plus stories written by LGBTQ plus authors that are banned and challenged across the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=173.2s)]
*  country. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=177.2s)]
*  According to our friends at Pan America, a nonprofit dedicated to the freedom to read [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=178.2s)]
*  and write, 39 percent of unique titles banned two or more times contain some form of LGBTQ [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=182.2s)]
*  plus representation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=188.2s)]
*  Nothing is ever done in a vacuum. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=190.2s)]
*  Mahmoud versus Taylor is being argued against a backdrop of book bands and censorship that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=192.2s)]
*  is affecting public education, vulnerable LGBTQ plus students and their families. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=196.2s)]
*  For so many, this is more than a storybook. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=201.2s)]
*  It's about their lives. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=204.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=205.2s)]
*  Today's meeting in the Velshi Band Book Club is officially underway. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=206.2s)]
*  I'm joined now by Robin Stephenson, author of numerous books for children and young [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=208.2s)]
*  adults, no stranger to controversy about them, including today's feature Pride Puppy. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=212.2s)]
*  The children's book is at the center of the current U.S. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=216.2s)]
*  Supreme Court case Mahmoud versus Taylor. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=219.2s)]
*  Robin, welcome to the Velshi Band Book Club. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=222.2s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me here. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=226.2s)]
*  So on one hand, you're famous because you're now in the middle of a Supreme Court case. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=229.2s)]
*  On the other hand, it's not actually what authors are looking for, right? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=234.2s)]
*  Talk to me as an author about what this involvement in the Supreme Court case means to you, both [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=238.2s)]
*  as an author and a person. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=244.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, it's been a difficult couple of years for sure. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=246.2s)]
*  And I think my main concern really is that this is a book that I wrote to include and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=252.2s)]
*  celebrate families like mine, families with two moms, families with people in them who [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=259.2s)]
*  are part of the LGBTQ plus community and seeing it be used in a way which I think is potentially [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=264.2s)]
*  going to do a lot of harm to access to books, to public education and in particular to children [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=271.2s)]
*  from families like mine has been really upsetting. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=279.2s)]
*  It was interesting, that little audio that we played of the Supreme Court oral arguments [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=284.2s)]
*  where it'd be one thing if we were just discussing the content in your book and why it should [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=289.2s)]
*  or shouldn't be shared with children. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=294.2s)]
*  But they're arguing the wrong thing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=297.2s)]
*  They're arguing about a character who had a leather jacket that somehow became a sex [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=299.2s)]
*  worker, which by the way, you might have been writing about, but that wasn't actually, that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=303.2s)]
*  wasn't actually central to the topic. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=307.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was, it was really shocking to listen to the oral arguments and hear Neil [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=313.2s)]
*  Gorsuch talk about bondage and sex workers. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=318.2s)]
*  This is a book for really young kids. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=321.2s)]
*  It's about a family. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=323.2s)]
*  It's, there's nothing remotely sexual in the book. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=324.2s)]
*  And, you know, there had been a lot of misrepresentation of the book over the two years leading up [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=328.2s)]
*  to the hearing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=332.2s)]
*  But this is a book that takes less than five minutes to read. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=334.2s)]
*  And, you know, maybe I was a little naive, but it really never occurred to me that the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=337.2s)]
*  justices wouldn't actually read the books that were centered in the case. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=342.2s)]
*  And there's just no way someone could read this book and come away thinking that this [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=347.2s)]
*  was a book about bondage. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=351.2s)]
*  And yet that's what comes up a lot when we talk to George M. Johnson about the books. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=353.2s)]
*  It's like people get sort of, they get their ideas in their mind. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=357.2s)]
*  We just put up the page that we're talking about, the letter L page, in which the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=359.2s)]
*  person second to the right is wearing a leather jacket. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=363.2s)]
*  That's the sex worker, apparently. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=368.2s)]
*  And the L for leash and loose and for keeping. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=371.2s)]
*  I'm sorry, leaping, leaping. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=376.2s)]
*  I'm sorry, not keeping, for leaping. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=378.2s)]
*  That's, your mind has to be pretty creative to make that about bondage. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=380.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's a pretty disturbing interpretation of a, what I think is a gorgeous illustration [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=386.2s)]
*  by Julie McLaughlin in a alphabet book for young kids. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=392.2s)]
*  It's certainly not an interpretation that any child would make. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=396.2s)]
*  And I've read this book to lots of kids. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=400.2s)]
*  And I have never seen anybody's mind go there other than Justice Gorsuch. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=402.2s)]
*  Justice Gorsuch. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=406.2s)]
*  Talk to me about aspiring authors who might be interested in writing not just LGBTQ plus [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=407.2s)]
*  content, but content that is for kids, but haven't published yet. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=413.2s)]
*  That's always my question. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=418.2s)]
*  Do these things encourage people to write or do they sort of scare people a little bit? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=419.2s)]
*  Because like you said, it's been a tough two years. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=423.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think both. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=426.2s)]
*  And I think, you know, as an author, I think, and talking to other authors, there is often that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=428.2s)]
*  sort of struggle with not wanting to censor ourselves and anticipating, you know, what the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=434.2s)]
*  reaction might be to the next book. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=441.2s)]
*  And at the same time, I think this backlash is such evidence of the need for these books. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=443.2s)]
*  And that this is about kids. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=448.2s)]
*  Kids need these books. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=450.2s)]
*  Kids need to see families like their own family on the page. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=451.2s)]
*  They need to see kids like themselves on the page. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=453.2s)]
*  So I think the fact that we're seeing so much pushback actually shows that we still need more of these books. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=455.2s)]
*  These are books that weren't around when my own kid was little. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=460.2s)]
*  And I think they're books that we need more of. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=462.2s)]
*  And I hope that people will keep writing and keep sharing their stories despite the potential backlash. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=469.2s)]
*  And one of the interesting things about this, because it's a book in schools, we've talked a lot on the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=474.2s)]
*  Velshe Band Book Club about how expensive children's books are. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=479.2s)]
*  Board books, illustrated books, colored books, they're expensive. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=482.2s)]
*  And so if they're not available at schools or libraries, there are just kids and parents who are not going to get access to them. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=485.2s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=495.2s)]
*  And I think these books are important for all kids. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=496.2s)]
*  I think that one of the things about public schools is that all our kids go to school together and they're all in the same classes together. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=498.2s)]
*  And they need to understand each other. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=506.2s)]
*  They need to know that other kids' families may look different from their own, but that all those families are equally valid and important. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=508.2s)]
*  And certainly some kids may have access to these books out of school, but many kids will not. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=515.2s)]
*  And whether that's because they're expensive or because their parents don't choose to purchase these particular books, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=520.2s)]
*  I think that this case potentially will limit access to these books for many children and that that's harmful to kids and to schools. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=526.2s)]
*  Well, Robin, we thank you for this. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=538.2s)]
*  And by the way, I just want to note this is not the only book you've written that has faced challenge, but you continue to write these important books for children. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=540.2s)]
*  And again, I think you make a very important point for all children. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=548.2s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8oa5TBoSBI&t=551.2s)]
