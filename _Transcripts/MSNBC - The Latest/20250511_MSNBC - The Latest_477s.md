# ‘Court of public opinion does matter’ in ICE arrests of students: Atlantic staff writer
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc)
*  New today, Fried Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk is speaking out after spending [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=0.0s)]
*  six weeks in an ICE detention facility. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=5.84s)]
*  Immigration agents wearing face masks snatched Ozturk off the streets of Massachusetts as [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=9.68s)]
*  part of the Trump administration crackdown on pro-Palestinian student activists. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  In the last 45 days, I lost both my freedom and also my education during a crucial time [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=20.68s)]
*  for my doctoral studies. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  America is the greatest democracy in the world, and I believe in those values that we share. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=28.48s)]
*  I have faith in the American system of justice. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=38.6s)]
*  And finally, I will also remind you one more time, please don't forget about all these [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=39.6s)]
*  wonderful women in the immigration detention systems. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=44.28s)]
*  Joining me now is Mark Leibovitch, staff writer with the Atlantic, MSNBC political contributor [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=49.0s)]
*  and author of Thank You for Your Servitude, Donald Trump's Washington and the Price of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=53.24s)]
*  Submission. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=57.68s)]
*  Welcome, my friends. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=58.68s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=59.68s)]
*  So Ozturk struck a hopeful and optimistic tone there in that very surprising, I guess, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=60.68s)]
*  soundbite we played considering what she's been through. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=68.12s)]
*  Or does it reflect a greater fear of autocracy, both where she was born and where she now [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  lives? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=76.56s)]
*  I would say probably both. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=79.0s)]
*  I mean, I think obviously she knows that for as much of an ordeal as she has been through, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=80.36s)]
*  at this point, when you're going to go before cameras, you are in some ways performing for [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=86.6s)]
*  people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=91.44s)]
*  It's a political statement to some degree, and the court of public opinion really does [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=92.44s)]
*  matter in these cases. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=97.44s)]
*  And you want to portray yourself as a sympathetic victim here, which frankly, I think many [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  people would say that she is. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=104.88s)]
*  It is a very delicate situation, obviously. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  I think clearly the White House thinks they have the politics on their side. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=109.16s)]
*  But also, I mean, the question of the optics of how it looks to have university students, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=113.84s)]
*  doctoral students plucked off the streets, literally as we're seeing here, is quite problematic [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  to what it means to be an American and how this country perceives itself. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  Following the arrest of Newark's mayor outside an ICE facility in New Jersey, a Homeland [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=128.84s)]
*  Security spokesperson is now threatening the arrest of House Democrats who were also at [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=132.76s)]
*  that facility. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=136.68s)]
*  Here's what Mayor Baraka had to say today. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=137.68s)]
*  What I just think is about intimidation and bullying. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=141.16s)]
*  This is like moving us slowly towards an authoritarian kind of government here, where they are telling [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=145.72s)]
*  people they can't come to a public place, they can't go onto a facility to even get [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=152.48s)]
*  a tour. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=158.28s)]
*  We weren't protesting. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  Nobody barged in. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  We were there peacefully. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  What is this escalation signal to you? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, it's definitely an escalation. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  I think when you go, but you're arresting judges, arresting mayors, threatening to arrest [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=169.6s)]
*  members of Congress, you do start to wonder, I mean, is this just intimidation or where [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=174.8s)]
*  does this end? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=180.96s)]
*  And is this going to be just the way this continues to go in the next few weeks? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=181.96s)]
*  I don't think this is going to continue to go without a lot of commentary. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=185.44s)]
*  I think this is the kind of thing that will over time certainly get the attention of a [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=190.28s)]
*  lot of people, and it could probably incite a lot of protest and certainly concern. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=194.64s)]
*  We'll see where it leads. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=198.83999999999997s)]
*  But it's obviously a kind of step that you don't see very often and we have not seen [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=200.27999999999997s)]
*  in this country in a long month. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=203.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=205.44s)]
*  Hey, Mark, just want to let you know we're getting some breaking news and it's pretty [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=206.44s)]
*  big and what we're hearing having been confirmed by Steve Witkoff confirming to NBC News that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=209.72s)]
*  Hamas intends to release the Israeli soldier, Edan Alexander. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  He is a dual U.S. citizen. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  Israeli Hamas has been in contact with the U.S. administration over the past couple of days, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=227.16s)]
*  and they are immediately trying to begin some intensive negotiations and exert some serious [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=232.16s)]
*  efforts to reach a final agreement to end the war. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=238.16s)]
*  This is all part of what we're hearing, but specifically from Steve Witkoff and the White [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=241.16s)]
*  House confirming that Edan Alexander will be released, again, a remaining citizen, rather [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=246.24s)]
*  a remaining hostage, a dual citizen, both Israel and the United States. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=253.84s)]
*  You hear that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=258.04s)]
*  What does that tell you aside from the hope that his family must be feeling relief and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=259.6s)]
*  joy and the like? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=263.88s)]
*  But what is that big picture messaging? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=265.24s)]
*  Well, I mean, first of all, I mean, anytime a hostage is released, it's a good day. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=267.36s)]
*  It's good news. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=275.16s)]
*  You hope it portends for more hopeful future. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=276.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=279.12s)]
*  So that's something to feel good about right there. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=280.12s)]
*  You know, I'm not obviously privy to negotiations or where it might be headed, but I do think [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=283.0s)]
*  that certainly you've got to take this as a sign of hope and hope that this is going [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=287.64s)]
*  to lead to other things. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=292.96s)]
*  But I also think that, as we know, anything in the Middle East, you've got to take any [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=294.68s)]
*  sort of sign or hope or optimism with a grain of salt. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=299.28s)]
*  But this is certainly a great development. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=302.28s)]
*  Are we certain, given some recent reporting, that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=305.64s)]
*  right now on the same page, there has been suggestion that Netanyahu isn't entirely pleased [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=310.92s)]
*  with some of the things that Donald Trump has been proposing relative to the war and [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  implementation of certain things. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think typically, I mean, Netanyahu and the Israelis in general are a little bit [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=327.08s)]
*  hesitant to think or at least perceive that the Americans are calling the shots in some [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=331.48s)]
*  way here. I mean, the Israelis have been very kind of protective of their autonomy, especially [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=335.4s)]
*  as these negotiations get driven. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=340.64s)]
*  So, you know, I wouldn't be at all surprised if certainly in private there's a lot of back [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  and forth and a lot of perhaps even misunderstanding about where either side is going to go. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=346.96s)]
*  I mean, it seems like, you know, if you take them with your word, I mean, everyone wants [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=352.08s)]
*  peace. But at the same time, there are different definitions of how to get there from these [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=356.64s)]
*  parties. And this is nothing new in the Middle East. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=360.8s)]
*  As I look at some information we've been given, and this is, again, from Hamas's point of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  view, the suggestion is the release of Elan Alexander will be part of the steps taken [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=367.8s)]
*  to achieve a ceasefire, to open the border crossings, allow aid and relief to reach our [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=373.96s)]
*  people in the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=379.32s)]
*  It all sounds like a very, very tall order. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  But the fact that this is a dual citizen, Israeli and United States, the value afforded [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=384.56s)]
*  to Elan Alexander for achieving this kind of negotiating, being this kind of a valuable [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=391.15999999999997s)]
*  chess piece, if you will. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=397.08s)]
*  Does any of this seem realistic to you? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=399.4s)]
*  All of these things that Hamas says is working toward realistic to be accomplished? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=401.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, every time, look, a hostage is released, it sort of becomes in some degree, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=408.6s)]
*  to some degree, a spin game to sort of listen to what both sides sort of think they're [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=414.28s)]
*  getting in the deal. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=418.44s)]
*  And obviously it looks like Hamas is coming out of the box, you know, pretty fulsomely [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=419.64s)]
*  hear about what they think they're getting. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=424.44s)]
*  Obviously there are two sides to this story and actually multiple sides to where this [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=425.96s)]
*  heads from here and what they've agreed to and where everyone is on this final deal. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=430.28s)]
*  But look, I mean, this is again, I mean, you would hope that it portends to greater progress, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=435.88s)]
*  greater dialogue and so forth here. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=441.64s)]
*  But again, I mean, the grains of salt you have to take this with, history shows us, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=443.96s)]
*  you just have to wait and see and see what actually transpires after the words, the flurry [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=448.91999999999996s)]
*  of words you see in the aftermath of these releases. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La2BCCWJ6Dc&t=454.44s)]
