# ‘Unprecedented spectacle’: Trump given royal treatment by his new close friends in Saudi Arabia
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA)
*  It turns out corruption makes for strange bedfellows. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=0.0s)]
*  We'll start the show in a way we've never started it before. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=3.6s)]
*  We will hand it over to Ben Shapiro and Ted Cruz. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Is this good for President Trump? Is it good for his agenda? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Is it good for draining the swamp and getting things done? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=13.8s)]
*  The answer is no, it isn't. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=16.0s)]
*  It isn't. If you want President Trump to succeed, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=18.2s)]
*  this kind of skeezy stuff needs to stop. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=21.0s)]
*  Well, listen, I'm not a fan of Qatar. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  I think they have a really disturbing pattern of funding, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=25.2s)]
*  theocratic lunatics who want to murder us, funding Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=29.0s)]
*  And that's a real problem. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=33.6s)]
*  I also think the plane poses significant espionage and surveillance problems. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=35.8s)]
*  So we'll see how this issue plays out. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=42.2s)]
*  How about that? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=46.0s)]
*  Now, the $400 million gift, the luxury Boeing 747, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=46.8s)]
*  given to Donald Trump from a nation with ties to terror groups, isn't enough for you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=52.2s)]
*  There is much more where that came from. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=56.6s)]
*  Today, the Saudis rolled out the red carpet for Donald Trump. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=58.6s)]
*  It's actually a lavender carpet. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=61.6s)]
*  And Trump and the Saudi Crown Prince touted all the deals they say they're busy making. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman promising Trump a trillion dollars in investments in the United States. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=68.2s)]
*  Of that, the New York Times writes this, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=74.2s)]
*  quote, economists say that number, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=76.0s)]
*  equivalent to the size of Saudi Arabia's annual gross domestic product, is not realistic. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=77.8s)]
*  But if Trump and the Saudis claims of a trillion dollars to be invested in the U.S. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=83.8s)]
*  isn't real, what is very real are all the business ventures that the Trump family has in store in the kingdom. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=88.4s)]
*  There is, of course, the Saudi-owned golf tournament, Live Golf. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=95.4s)]
*  Trump properties have hosted seven Live Golf tournaments. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  But there's more. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  NPR reports this, quote, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  Just weeks ago, his son, Eric Trump, who runs the Trump org, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  was in the region for the launch of two new projects with the Saudi developer, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=108.2s)]
*  a high-rise Trump hotel tower that will have the world's highest pool [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=112.4s)]
*  and a sprawling Trump golf course with villas in Doha, Qatar. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=117.0s)]
*  Trump will end his trip in the United Arab Emirates, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=121.2s)]
*  where his son, Eric Trump, was touring that hotel tower with a pool 1,000 feet in the sky days ago. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=124.2s)]
*  Here's what Eric Trump said then. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=130.4s)]
*  I have to say, on behalf of myself, on behalf of my family, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=132.2s)]
*  we love Dubai. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=137.4s)]
*  We love the golf. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=138.8s)]
*  We love the people. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=140.0s)]
*  We have so many incredible friends here. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=141.6s)]
*  We have such a great relationship between the United States [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=143.8s)]
*  and just one of the greatest places. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  And I'm proud to call so many of you friends. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  It's the president's son. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  But it's not just real estate deals at stake for Eric and his brothers and his family. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  Washington Post reports this, quote, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=165.4s)]
*  Trump's family's cryptocurrency venture, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=167.8s)]
*  already at the center of allegations of corruption, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=170.2s)]
*  is increasingly intertwined with Middle Eastern investment. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=172.6s)]
*  Last week, an investment firm backed by Abu Dhabi said it plans to plow $2 billion into the venture. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  That would be $2 billion poured directly into a Trump-owned cryptocurrency, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=182.0s)]
*  what Senator Chris Murphy at the time called, quote, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=187.0s)]
*  the biggest corruption scandal in the history of the American presidency. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=190.0s)]
*  We'll join us in the next hour to talk about that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  But the unprecedented spectacle of an American president and his family doing deals [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  while representing the American people on the world stage [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  is where we start today with some of our favorite reporters in France. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=204.2s)]
*  New York Times White House correspondent Luke Broadwater [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=207.39999999999998s)]
*  joins us from Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=209.6s)]
*  Plus, managing editor of The Bulwark and MSNBC contributor Sam Stein is here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  Luke, take us through what's happening on the ground there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  Sure. Well, it's been a whirlwind arrival for Donald Trump. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=222.2s)]
*  He has been treated essentially like a hero arriving in Riyadh. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=227.2s)]
*  He, you know, had the crown prince came out to greet him on the tarmac. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=233.2s)]
*  They rolled out the lavender carpet, as you mentioned. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=237.2s)]
*  You know, he was greeted by a performance of Arabian horses and a drum performance. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=240.2s)]
*  I mean, they are laying it on thick. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=247.2s)]
*  I mean, they are laying it on thick with all of the niceties to Donald Trump. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=250.2s)]
*  And he's returning the favor. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=255.2s)]
*  You know, he proclaimed at a meeting of business elites from around the world [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=257.2s)]
*  and Saudi Royals that the only country hotter than the United States was Saudi Arabia [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=263.2s)]
*  in terms of how hot they were making the deals. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=268.2s)]
*  So he is reveling in this environment where he's being fetid, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=272.2s)]
*  where money is being thrown around, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=276.2s)]
*  billions of dollars in some cases. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=282.2s)]
*  And so there's a lot at stake here. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=285.2s)]
*  And one of the things they just announced was $142 billion in defense spending [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=288.2s)]
*  that Saudi Arabia is going to purchase from American companies. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=295.2s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, look, there's a lot of money being exchanged, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=299.2s)]
*  and Donald Trump's at the center of all of it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=304.2s)]
*  What is the policy purpose of the trip? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=306.2s)]
*  Right. So, you know, we tried to get that question out of the White House before we left. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=312.2s)]
*  What we were told was essentially the policy purpose was the deals. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=319.2s)]
*  It was the economic relationships. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=323.2s)]
*  It was transactional. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=326.2s)]
*  It was about showing that Donald Trump can go to a country [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=328.2s)]
*  and bring home a bunch of business for American companies [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=332.2s)]
*  and open up doors for American companies in those foreign countries. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=336.2s)]
*  That said, there was some policy announcements today. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=341.2s)]
*  He announced at the behest of the Saudi government and the Turkish government [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=345.2s)]
*  that he was going to lift sanctions against Syria that had been on Syria for some time. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=350.2s)]
*  So the new leader of Syria, who, you know, used to be associated with al-Qaeda [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=356.2s)]
*  and has now renounced the group, is going to have a fresh start [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=363.2s)]
*  and going to have the American sanctions lifted in Syria. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=368.2s)]
*  Luke, what is their explanation for why they are only going to three countries in the Middle East? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=372.2s)]
*  So they say that these are the three close friends. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=380.2s)]
*  You know, that is true. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=386.2s)]
*  Qatar has recently become more of a friend of the United States. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=389.2s)]
*  It wasn't always that way. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=393.2s)]
*  Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia have been for some time. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=395.2s)]
*  But they also do share the similarity that all three are places [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=401.2s)]
*  where Trump's family has long held, had business interests and has current business deals. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=406.2s)]
*  You know, in the United Arab Emirates, there's the big crypto investment. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=413.2s)]
*  In Qatar, there's the big new golf course. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=418.2s)]
*  And Saudi, they're building a new high-rise, or they're lending their name to a new high-rise in Saudi Arabia. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=421.2s)]
*  And there's something like six deals in the work, major deals between the Trump Organization [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=428.2s)]
*  and a Saudi-linked real estate firm. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=433.2s)]
*  So, you know, and we asked them, you know, where does the president's professional trip end [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=437.2s)]
*  and his family's personal trip begins, right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=444.2s)]
*  And they have insisted there's no commingling, there's no intertwining, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=448.2s)]
*  that the Trump Organization is separate, even though Donald Trump still collects profits [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=453.2s)]
*  and revenues from the Trump Organization. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=458.2s)]
*  They say his son's managing now, and so there's no conflict of interest here, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=462.2s)]
*  basically nothing to see here, which is obviously a quite different response [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=467.2s)]
*  than the stance they had towards the Biden family and the work that Hunter Biden was doing overseas. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=473.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFFrStknAA&t=488.2s)]
