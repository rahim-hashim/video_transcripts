# Travel ban 2.0: How the Trump admin used a ‘monarch approach’ to draft the list
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc)
*  So Rick, what's your take on the justification by the president for this travel ban? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=0.0s)]
*  Right now, millions of people all around the world, or at least in 17 countries, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=4.96s)]
*  are being told, we don't want you here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=11.28s)]
*  Well, Chris, as the professor said, there's probably legal justification for it. But [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=16.64s)]
*  just in terms of the way American governments work, and the office of the president normally [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  works, in any other administration, if they had done something like this, they would have explained [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=27.52s)]
*  why each of those nations was on the bill. You can look at your screen, Afghanistan, me and Marchad, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=32.64s)]
*  etc. The Trump administration operates more like a monarch, in the sense that they just say the names, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=39.2s)]
*  they put them on a list, they don't give any explanation for it. I mean, there are, and so [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=46.4s)]
*  what happens is a lot of people try to imagine what the explanation is, and they think, well, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  this country is actually more peaceful than another country that's not on the list, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=56.0s)]
*  and it would be helpful if the administration would say why they've chosen these countries [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=60.16s)]
*  rather than other countries, what's going wrong in these places. That would be helpful to everybody. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=64.88s)]
*  And let me correct myself. I think I said a smaller number, but it's 19 total 12 in the ban, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=70.56s)]
*  and then the others with less stringent requirements there. You see the restricted. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=78.16s)]
*  Rick, we also heard the president talk about China. There was a phone call earlier today. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=84.88s)]
*  He said he invited President Xi to the U.S., vice versa. After weeks of escalating tensions, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  a bad relationship that seemed to be getting worse. Do you see reason to think, at least in talking, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=94.88s)]
*  that there is hope for a turnaround here? Well, Chris, I look at what the president [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  tweeted on Truth Social about how difficult it is to negotiate with the Chinese. I was in the room [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=107.36s)]
*  with Xi Jinping and President Obama and Secretary Kerry a number of times. He is a tough negotiator [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=113.12s)]
*  because he has a better hand than most of the people. He certainly has a better hand at the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=119.12s)]
*  moment than the U.S. He wouldn't actually, when there were things that the president or the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=122.72s)]
*  secretary of state asked him to do or to respond to, he often didn't respond. He would give [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  platitudes and say, you know, spring is a nice time of the year. I imagine that's exactly what [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=132.88s)]
*  he's doing with President Trump. And of course, China does have an advantage right now. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=138.4s)]
*  China is the world's largest vehicle maker. They make two thirds of the world's electric vehicles. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=143.04s)]
*  They lead the world in the production of aluminum, steel, copper, you name it. He can just wait Trump [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=148.4s)]
*  out. And that's probably what they're doing. You know, the Chinese, you know, when you ask [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=156.16s)]
*  what time it is in China, they look at the calendar, not at their watches. So I think Xi [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=160.72s)]
*  is looking down the road. And the other thing that people don't talk about is these tariffs [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=164.8s)]
*  are an opportunity for China with all of their other nations around the world in Southeast Asia, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=171.36s)]
*  in Europe. The U.S. is disrupting its bilateral relationship with all these places. And China is [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=177.28s)]
*  moving in and saying, look, we're not going to do anything like that. We believe in free trade and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=182.96s)]
*  transparency and not talking to you about your politics. So this is a huge advantage for China. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  Let me ask you about one more international situation that was discussed there. And it is [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=193.44s)]
*  the very high stakes conversations we expect are going on behind closed doors about the ongoing [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=198.16s)]
*  war in Ukraine. Let me play for you the exchange between the two world leaders about Ukraine right [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=204.56s)]
*  now. And MERS, who has a reputation for being very straight talking, was very straight talking [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=211.04s)]
*  and maybe not in every way that Donald Trump would want to hear. Take a listen. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=218.24s)]
*  We are on the side of Ukraine and we are trying to get them stronger and stronger just to make [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=222.88s)]
*  Putin stop this war. And this is all this is our approach. We get satellite pictures of the war [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=228.08s)]
*  field. Yeah. And you don't even like to look at them. Right. It's terrible. So it's bodies, arms, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=232.8s)]
*  heads, legs all over the place. You've never seen anything like it. It's so ridiculous. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=240.16s)]
*  And this is only by Russian weapons against Ukraine. This had never happened with Ukraine [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=247.28s)]
*  weapons against Russia. Never. Ukraine is only targeting military targets, not civilians, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=253.2s)]
*  not private, not instruments, not energy infrastructure. So this is the difference. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=260.64s)]
*  And that's the reason why we are trying to do more on Russia, how to stop this war. Well, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=265.92s)]
*  in this case, I'm talking about the battlefield, you know, the soldiers on soldiers, but you could [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=270.96s)]
*  also say that too with the city. The cities are being hit also. So it's a terrible, terrible thing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=275.04s)]
*  So just to set the stage, we are in a period where European leaders have been trying to get the U.S., [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  trying to get Donald Trump to be more supportive of Ukraine, more in the realm of Joe Biden's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=288.0s)]
*  approach to this war, where his commitment to that has been elusive. What did you hear in that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=296.16s)]
*  exchange, Rick? Well, Chris, first, let me applaud the president for saying he wants to stop the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=303.92s)]
*  killing and that all the killing on both sides is odious and should be gotten rid of. But the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=310.56s)]
*  chancellor was very strong there because what he heard and what we all heard is Trump equating [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=317.76s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia, giving a sense of moral equivalence between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=324.24s)]
*  Russia is the aggressor. Russia attacked a peaceful nation on its border, a sovereign, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=330.16s)]
*  independent nation and the greatest incursion since World War II. So he is listening, the chancellor [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  is listening to Trump saying that and he's coming in very strongly, as Trump would say, and saying, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  look, we unilaterally support Ukraine. Ukraine is the victim here. We're trying to make sure that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=346.0s)]
*  they come out whole. And the way to do that is to put pressure on the aggressor. He said that [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  unmistakably and clearly. And I welcome that as well. And Gabe, the president also defended his [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  bill, his mega bill, as a big tax cut, a benefit to small businesses, whereas most analysts would [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=366.88s)]
*  say the biggest benefit by far is to the wealthiest Americans. But he also argued that Elon Musk's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  criticism was self-serving. He said things like, you know, this is a very glamorous place, a very [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=380.32s)]
*  glamorous office, and then people leave and then they become hostile. Then in real time on X, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=385.76s)]
*  Elon Musk was kind of trolling the president. Do we have a better sense today of the ongoing [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  impact, if any, of Elon Musk and whether his attacks could actually endanger the bill's passage? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=401.84s)]
*  Well, Chris, it looks like the bromance is officially over. We all heard the president there [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=407.36s)]
*  in the Oval Office really giving his strongest comments, pushing back on Elon Musk so far. And [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=412.08s)]
*  look, he confirmed that he was disappointed that through our reporting, we had heard that that was [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=417.76s)]
*  the case over the last several days, that the president was caught off guard. And the president [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=423.44s)]
*  various points during this availability inside the Oval Office did confirm just that. He said that he [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=428.96s)]
*  thinks that Elon Musk misses the place, referring to him leaving the White House. You'll recall, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=435.52s)]
*  Chris, it was less than a week ago that Elon Musk was giving this sendoff in the Oval Office. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=440.4s)]
*  And President Trump seemed to be saying he was disappointed, caught off guard again just several [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  days after that sendoff. The president also saying that Elon and I had a good relationship. I don't [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=452.47999999999996s)]
*  know if we will anymore. And he says, I'm very disappointed in Elon. And then, Chris, he also [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  brought up this idea that he believes the reason that Elon Musk is now opposing this [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=465.12s)]
*  big, beautiful bill is because of the lack of EV tax credits inside the bill. Now, Musk himself, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=470.08s)]
*  he has repeatedly said that the reason he opposes this is because of the increase in the deficit. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=477.92s)]
*  That is not something that President Trump has really seemed to care about much in previous times, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=483.6s)]
*  but also the administration is arguing that it won't increase the deficit and then the growth [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=490.24s)]
*  from this bill will ultimately even out and even lead to a surplus. But several headlines [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=494.24s)]
*  there on the president railing against Elon Musk and seeming to preempt any other criticisms that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=499.92s)]
*  Musk may have going forward. He also touched on several other domestic topics, which you mentioned [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=506.16s)]
*  saying that he thought that Harvard was starting to behave. And also, Chris, mentioning several [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=512.08s)]
*  things about the auto pen, which you addressed earlier. Yeah, I also will do a fact check on [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=520.4s)]
*  Harvard. He said Harvard didn't want to give us the list, that is, of the international students. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  Those international students had visas, so the administration does know who they are. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhAhVqZbNRc&t=529.36s)]
