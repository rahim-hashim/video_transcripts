# Trump backs Hegseth: 'Trump hates firing loyal people'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o)
*  Now let's get back to the latest controversy surrounding Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=0.0s)]
*  There's new reporting that he shared war plans in another group chat and according to former [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=6.88s)]
*  Pentagon spokesperson, not some person in the media out to get the White House Pentagon [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=13.02s)]
*  spokesperson and self-proclaimed friend of Hegseth, the department is facing a full-blown [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=18.44s)]
*  meltdown. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=24.0s)]
*  With me for more, Jonathan Villas, editor at The Bullwork. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=25.0s)]
*  Jonathan, I'm a big fan of your work and I'm glad you're here tonight. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=27.6s)]
*  Let's start with Hegseth. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  Right now the president is sticking by him, but we've all seen The Apprentice. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=32.32s)]
*  Almost every episode ends in tears. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=36.04s)]
*  How do you think this is going to go? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=38.56s)]
*  You know, it's hard to say because Trump hates firing people who are loyal to him. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=42.04s)]
*  And so, you know, when it happens with like a Corey Lewandowski or Ford, it's more like [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  the Godfather telling Frankie Five Angels that he has to go and do a stretch for him, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=55.84s)]
*  You got to go away to Attica for five years, but then we know we'll bring you back. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=56.88s)]
*  So it's hard for me to see because Hegseth is really tight on with Trump, right? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=61.24s)]
*  And he's hugged Trump. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=68.04s)]
*  There's no daylight between them. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=70.16s)]
*  And yet this is the weirdest thing, Stephanie. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=73.64s)]
*  The Hegseth tenure, all like 12 weeks of it, have been an absolute S-show. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=77.36s)]
*  Like can I say that in the 11th hour? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=82.68s)]
*  Can we say that? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  An S-show, yes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, an S-show, right. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=86.52s)]
*  It must be so much worse than we know to have this stuff coming from inside the Pentagon. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  Okay, that's exactly what I want to talk about. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=97.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=100.36s)]
*  These things are coming from other Hegseth appointees. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=101.36s)]
*  These are not even career guys, right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=103.88s)]
*  Okay, but if you are running any large corporation or a big portion of our government, it's really [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=106.16s)]
*  hard and complicated. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=112.32s)]
*  And when an unqualified, unpopular person is put at the helm, they are super vulnerable [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=113.92s)]
*  to mutiny. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  So is that what's happening to Hegseth? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=122.4s)]
*  The rank-and-file who are dedicated people who are part of this organization, many of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=124.12s)]
*  whom who are loyal to him and the president, they're in a position where they could just [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=128.96s)]
*  take this guy down quickly. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=133.08s)]
*  Yeah, but it's, I mean, again, it's not even clear to me that this is a palace coup in [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=134.76s)]
*  that way. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=140.32s)]
*  I think people are worried about it hurting Trump. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=141.32s)]
*  And the stuff we've said, as you've been reading between the lines during the criminology, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=144.68s)]
*  we think there's going to be more scandal, more bad stuff about Hegseth's management [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=149.92s)]
*  coming out in the coming days, probably by the end of this week. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=154.4s)]
*  And if there's even more there, it's stunning. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=158.4s)]
*  And this says a lot, because our bar is pretty low. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=163.66s)]
*  We've all been stuck in this movie for 5,000 years at this point. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=166.72s)]
*  And I, it is at once the least surprising thing in the universe, right? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=170.12s)]
*  The weekend TV host turns out to be fully unqualified to be Secretary of Defense, who [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=179.6s)]
*  could possibly have guessed, right? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  But on the other hand, some of this stuff is so crazy, doing signal chats with his wife [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  and sharing war plans on his personal cell phone. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  It is, I mean, this guy is dumber than a bag of hammers. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  It's only been 92 days. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  All right, I want to move on though. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  92 days! [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  I want to talk about the Supreme Court decision that came over the weekend that temporarily [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  blocks deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=208.28s)]
*  What's your take there? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  For me, it's the form of the decision. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  It's the fact that this comes out at, you know, one o'clock in the morning on a Saturday [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=217.44s)]
*  morning and it's 7-2, and they don't even let Alito finish what he's writing in his [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=221.28s)]
*  dissent. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=227.52s)]
*  Clearly, the Supreme Court got word that the administration was moving ahead with some [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=228.96s)]
*  more deportations after saying, and this is the key part, Stephanie, after telling the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=233.12s)]
*  courts that they weren't going to. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  And so we are hitting the point where even guys like Kavanaugh and Gorsuch are taking [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  things that the government lawyers are representing to court and saying, we can't trust what the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  government is saying to us in court, which is, again, just wildly different from the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=253.44s)]
*  first Trump term. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=258.32s)]
*  In the first Trump term, you'd have Trump tweeting out whatever crazy stuff you'd say, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=259.32s)]
*  and then his lawyers would go before courts and be normal lawyers. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=264.04s)]
*  And if even the Trumpy Supreme Court justices are now looking at this and saying, huh, things [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=267.92s)]
*  are so off the rails, we have to assume that the government's own lawyers are probably [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=275.04s)]
*  not telling us the truth about the government's position, that's really bad. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=279.48s)]
*  And again, it just it reinforces to me that is from the outside as horrible as everything [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=284.12s)]
*  looks. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=289.96s)]
*  And I really think it is we are basically living in the worst case scenario. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=290.96s)]
*  You know, if you go if you wind back the clock five months and told people that Pete Hegseth [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=294.16s)]
*  would be Secretary of Defense, they would say, oh, you have Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=298.48s)]
*  There's no way he would pick some dude from Fox to be sec def. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=302.48s)]
*  As bad as things seem, I think on the inside, they're probably much worse. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKWEj7vRE-o&t=306.28000000000003s)]
