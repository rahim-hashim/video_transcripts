# 'Communities are in fear': Immigrant advocate says Trump admin is disregarding due process
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww)
*  I want to bring in NBC's senior Homeland Security correspondent Julia Ainsley and Malou Chavez, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=0.0s)]
*  executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  Malou, I want to start with you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=7.84s)]
*  Here's what the daughter of one of the workers who was detained by ICE on Friday had to say. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=9.6s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=14.4s)]
*  I was present during the rape. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=15.4s)]
*  I saw with my own eyes the pain of the families, crying, screaming, not knowing what to do, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=17.72s)]
*  just like me. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  That's why the families demand free of all workers, legal representation, and due process [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Are you having a lot of conversations like that with the families that you've been talking to, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=30.0s)]
*  especially as they see story after story about the Trump administration cracking down? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=35.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=39.84s)]
*  Our communities are in fear. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=41.96s)]
*  They definitely have questions. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  There's a lot of confusion about who is being targeted and having large scale arrests in our [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=46.2s)]
*  communities is not helping. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=53.2s)]
*  Our communities understand that there is a process, but due process is being disregarded. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=55.48s)]
*  And many of our community members are feeling the impact. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=62.12s)]
*  There's family separation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=65.72s)]
*  There's an increase in detention and potential deportation, which is going to lead to great [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=67.24s)]
*  numbers of families being separated. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=74.12s)]
*  And I've heard anecdotes from advocates about a chilling effect in communities across the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=77.24s)]
*  country. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=82.0s)]
*  But just to give one example of the kind of personal impact that we're hearing about, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=83.0s)]
*  the New York Times had a story on how soccer fans are canceling watch parties out of fear [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=85.52s)]
*  of being targeted in immigration raids. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=89.64s)]
*  One person told the Times, quote, people are being snatched off the street and getting [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  arrested. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=96.32s)]
*  We decided not to do the game because we thought it could ruin the lives of many people. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=97.32s)]
*  To just carry that example, it's worth noting that the U.S. is hosting a big international [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=101.2s)]
*  soccer tournament next week. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=105.0s)]
*  And then of course, the World Cup next year, literally the biggest event in sports. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=106.6s)]
*  The president himself has touted it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=110.44000000000001s)]
*  Millions of fans are expected to visit, including from countries targeted in that travel ban. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=112.84s)]
*  So Malou, what concerns do you have against that backdrop? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  We know that there's an option to travel and that many of these countries will be impacted, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  whether they're banned fully or partially. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=129.6s)]
*  We know that U.S. port of entry officers have a lot of discretion. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=135.08s)]
*  And to the extent that they have confusion about who is subjected to this ban, many of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=140.12s)]
*  our community members might experience, when they travel to the U.S. or have their loved [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  ones travel to the U.S., might experience denial of entry. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  And this travel ban just makes it even worse because there are processes for a community [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  members to bring their family members through family petitions or through approved immigrant [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  visas or non-immigrant visas. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=170.16s)]
*  But with this travel ban, it's just going to lead to additional confusion and potential [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=172.6s)]
*  detention of people. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=177.28s)]
*  And that tracks with the anxiety that we were hearing about in our last segment from George [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=179.0s)]
*  Solis, who's over at Miami International Airport. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, Julia, I keep coming back to your recent reporting about Stephen Miller, Trump's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  deputy chief of staff and the man who's widely considered to be the architect of this administration's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=189.12s)]
*  immigration policies. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=193.76s)]
*  Your reporting consistently has been that he's berating and threatening to fire ICE [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=195.04s)]
*  officials if they don't meet certain quotas of arrests. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=199.04s)]
*  So do you see these ramp ups in places like Los Angeles as a result of that pressure from [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=202.28s)]
*  the top? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  In fact, we've seen it in different ways, Ali. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  Some of these targets, some of these targeted cities that we're seeing ramped up immigration [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=211.68s)]
*  enforcement and now are actually pinpointed before the Trump administration even came [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=216.16s)]
*  in. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=220.72s)]
*  I heard Los Angeles being brought up again and again at the top of the list, which was [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=222.2s)]
*  surprising because in January, Los Angeles was battling historic wildfires. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=225.84s)]
*  We're also hearing that cities like Chicago could soon see ramped up immigration enforcement. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=231.0s)]
*  We've begun to see protests here, there as well. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=235.36s)]
*  This is all part of a response to Miller's pressure to try to ramp up immigration arrests [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=237.86s)]
*  and deportations because previously, even though they were doing things that had a big [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=243.4s)]
*  splash like deporting people to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, the numbers weren't [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=247.28s)]
*  even at the same level that they were in the Biden administration during those same time [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=252.6s)]
*  periods the year prior. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=256.28s)]
*  And so this is all ICE responding to that pressure from Miller. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=257.88s)]
*  People want to keep their jobs. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=261.64s)]
*  They want to come up with these quotas. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=262.96s)]
*  He set it at 3,000 a day. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=264.92s)]
*  Right now, they're meeting about 2,200 a day, still vastly larger than they were just a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=266.96s)]
*  month prior. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=271.44s)]
*  And I think the targeting of these cities are no accident. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=272.92s)]
*  They're going to sanctuary cities. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=276.36s)]
*  They want to have clashes with Democratic mayors and governors over these policies. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=277.68s)]
*  It's the fight they want to have. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=282.8s)]
*  We're seeing that escalation with calling in the National Guard. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=284.36s)]
*  And to be fair, DHS is also pointing us to a dozen people who they say were arrested [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  in L.A. recently who do have serious crimes that they've committed. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  But of course, that's not what people are protesting. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=296.28s)]
*  They're protesting about people, the fathers, like you mentioned, people in their community [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=298.68s)]
*  who they say may have been undocumented but had committed no other crime other than being [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=302.92s)]
*  in the United States illegally, some of them even entering legally under programs that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=307.88s)]
*  have expired. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=311.8s)]
*  That's where these protests are beginning. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=313.0s)]
*  It's the beginning of summer when we often see protests and big movements like this take [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=314.68s)]
*  off across the country. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=319.16s)]
*  So I think we're reaching a real tipping point in this immigration and deportation campaign [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=320.64s)]
*  from this administration, where not only are they ramping up arrest, but the public is [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=325.56s)]
*  paying attention in a way that, frankly, I haven't seen since the family separation policy [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=330.04s)]
*  of 2018. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=334.28s)]
*  Yeah, this does certainly seem like a tipping point and also potentially a blueprint. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=335.28s)]
*  I mean, Julie, I remember just a few weeks ago in Washington, there were a series of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=339.04s)]
*  raids on restaurant and then a lot of anxiety and concern that it could be more widespread [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=343.16s)]
*  than that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=347.96s)]
*  Ultimately, it didn't come to fruition at that point. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=348.96s)]
*  But that's what the community in Los Angeles is responding to. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=351.06s)]
*  So Malou, on your side of the equation, how are you preparing yourself, your organization, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=354.08s)]
*  your community for what could be a long haul here? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=358.68s)]
*  For us, it's important to share with our community what our rights are and ensuring that when [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=362.84s)]
*  we get the chance to remind ourselves about what to do with interactions with enforcement [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=368.84s)]
*  agencies. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  But, of course, even when they are exercising their rights, we're seeing violations. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  Even when people are showing up to court as they should be and following the process, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=382.68s)]
*  we are seeing detentions happening at the courthouses across the country. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=388.36s)]
*  In Seattle, certainly we're seeing families being separated when people do have pending [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=393.44s)]
*  relief and as a result of judges dismissing the case because the government prosecutors [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=399.04s)]
*  are asking for dismissals, we are seeing now community members subject to something called [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=404.96s)]
*  expedited removal and essentially being detained. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=410.76s)]
*  And so one of our local, exactly our local immigration jail in Tacoma is at capacity [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  with many of our community members experiencing detention. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=422.84000000000003s)]
*  And so there's a lot of fear. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=426.76s)]
*  We also feel very supported by our community at large who are saying this has to stop, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=428.64000000000004s)]
*  there needs to be a process and due process needs to be exercised. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=435.8s)]
*  And so we certainly support the right of people expressing their civil rights in opposition [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=440.12s)]
*  of government action. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=446.64s)]
*  But this is all creating fear in our communities. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=448.32s)]
*  And what we can do is continue to do our job using our skills as immigration rights, immigrant [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=451.4s)]
*  rights advocates, and continue to share what our rights are for our communities and following [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=458.4s)]
*  the process as we know it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=464.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxFVWd3xBww&t=469.52s)]
