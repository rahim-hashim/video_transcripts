# ‘These colors don’t run’: HRC launches Pride Month with message of resilience and resistance
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM)
*  June is just two days away, which not only marks the start of summer, but also the start [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=0.0s)]
*  of Pride Month. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=4.96s)]
*  And as the Human Rights Campaign puts it, visibility has never mattered more. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=5.96s)]
*  Joining us now, National Press Secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, Brandon Wolf. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=10.76s)]
*  So Brandon, this is Pride Month. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  D.C. is hosting World Pride. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=16.32s)]
*  And yet it comes at a time where this community is facing attacks from the government right [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=18.92s)]
*  now on a litany of issues. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=24.52s)]
*  So first talk about the theme of this Pride Month, which I understand you guys are just [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=26.84s)]
*  unveiling and how it fits into that landscape. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=30.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm so excited. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=32.36s)]
*  So the theme is, these colors don't run. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=33.6s)]
*  Obviously, it's a little cheeky. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=35.76s)]
*  But I think it's also two things. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=37.78s)]
*  It is an acknowledgement of our history, of the resilience and strength of the LGBTQ [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=39.5s)]
*  plus community, and it's a declaration of our present and our future. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=44.04s)]
*  I'm also really excited to share that the Human Rights Campaign now has over 3.6 million [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=48.44s)]
*  members and supporters across the country, which is a record for us. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=53.5s)]
*  And that's not just a big number. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=57.1s)]
*  Those are people, right? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=58.52s)]
*  Those are millions of people who've said, in this moment, in this political environment, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=59.66s)]
*  I want to do something more. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=63.66s)]
*  I want to take action to fight for equality. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=65.22s)]
*  It's the parent of a trans young person who maybe shared their story with a lawmaker for [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=67.42s)]
*  the first time. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=72.1s)]
*  It's the teacher who's stocking the shelves with books that make sure all families are [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=73.1s)]
*  seen and represented. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=77.4s)]
*  It's a healthcare provider who wants to know how they can fight to ensure that HIV care [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=78.7s)]
*  and resources continue to go on in this country. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=83.18s)]
*  So I think these colors don't run. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=85.7s)]
*  I think that that spirit of resilience and resistance is about acknowledging that this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=88.06s)]
*  is a community that has been through incredibly difficult times before and has turned those [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=92.66s)]
*  obstacles into progress. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=97.22s)]
*  And it's also a declaration that there is no president that can push us back into the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=98.78s)]
*  closet. There is no government that can strip us of our joy, of our fight for freedom. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=102.94s)]
*  We're not going anywhere. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=108.18s)]
*  And pride is not just going to be a celebration. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=109.62s)]
*  It's also going to be a protest. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=112.02s)]
*  I was going to say, I've had several people remind me, including you, in our off-camera [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=113.25999999999999s)]
*  conversations, that this is a yet another moment where folks can be reminded that pride [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=116.94s)]
*  began as a riot. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=121.86s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=122.78s)]
*  And likely we'll see that in the pride commemorations that we see throughout the country. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=123.46s)]
*  Talk a little bit about what you're expecting, maybe not just here in D.C., but across the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=128.38s)]
*  country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=132.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think the world pride activities here in D.C. kind of encapsulate what I expect [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=132.82s)]
*  we'll see across the country. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=137.14s)]
*  There's a little bit of joy and celebration. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=138.85999999999999s)]
*  You might have tickets. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=141.26000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=142.26000000000002s)]
*  Jennifer Lopez, Troye Sivan, Shakira. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=142.78s)]
*  There's going to be big names in town encouraging people to dance and find joy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=145.18s)]
*  Because, by the way, our joy has always been a source of resistance. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=150.02s)]
*  In a country where people have often told us, you should be quiet, you should go back [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=153.94s)]
*  into the closet, being out and proud and unapologetic is a part of the protest against [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=158.78s)]
*  that political climate. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=164.74s)]
*  So I think you're going to see a lot of celebration and joy. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=166.46s)]
*  And you're also going to feel this fierce resistance to the kind of attacks that we've [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=169.62s)]
*  seen from the Trump administration. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=173.5s)]
*  We have on Friday, June 6th at 5 p.m. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=175.22s)]
*  outside the Supreme Court, we're hosting a rally in support of Andres Hernandez Romero, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=178.06s)]
*  the gay Venezuelan makeup artist who was unlawfully disappeared by the Trump administration [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=182.46s)]
*  to El Salvador. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=189.22s)]
*  You're also going to see on Sunday, June 8th, there's a I think there's a march that starts [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=190.5s)]
*  in downtown D.C. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=196.22s)]
*  And it's really to push back against all of the attacks, executive orders, the things [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=197.42s)]
*  happening in Congress here in Washington, D.C. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=201.9s)]
*  So that balance of joy and celebration and also fight back and protest, that's in the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=204.18s)]
*  DNA of the LGBTQ plus community. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=210.34s)]
*  And I think you're going to see it on display across the country. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And I think in my conversations with sources and advocates, including you, the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=214.7s)]
*  larger theme here has been that they're looking at the various policies that are coming out [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=219.22s)]
*  of this administration, whether it's in reconciliation, barring health care services for trans [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=223.42s)]
*  folks, whether it's the administration barring trans folks from the military. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=227.89999999999998s)]
*  There are these various waves of restrictions coming on this community. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=231.85999999999999s)]
*  And this month could be a moment to elevate those while also showing the joy of the LGBTQ [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=235.42s)]
*  plus community. Brandon Wolf, the national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=241.26s)]
*  thank you for coming on with us. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=244.98s)]
*  Thank you. And earlier in the show, we asked the viewers, why are you awake? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=246.54s)]
*  Stay for this. This is fun. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=250.54s)]
*  Dominic emailed, I'm up way too early because my cat Bandit decided to wake me up way too early. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  Look at this little face, though. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=258.06s)]
*  I don't know how anyone could be mad. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=259.46000000000004s)]
*  It's so cute. So cute. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=261.02s)]
*  I need one of those faces to wake me up. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=262.38s)]
*  Right. I wasn't allergic to cats. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=263.82s)]
*  Christopher says his dog, Ferris Bueller, is looking for breakfast. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=265.62s)]

*  Oh, lots of cute faces today. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=277.26s)]
*  And Joe sent us his high school yearbook picture from 1985. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=279.86s)]
*  He says he's getting some work done before he leaves for Atlantic City for his 40 year high school reunion. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=283.94s)]
*  Congrats on perfect attendance, Joe. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=289.34000000000003s)]
*  That's pretty impressive. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=291.7s)]
*  And enjoy the reunion. Atlantic City. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=293.02s)]

*  We're going to dig into that and some of the possible causes. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=302.26s)]
*  And then coming up on Morning Joe, the latest on the legal battle over President Trump's tariffs. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=305.18s)]
*  Including how an appeal court's ruling to temporarily reinstate the levies might impact the administration [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=309.66s)]
*  as it looks to strike trade deals around the world. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=315.3s)]
*  Plus, David Drucker of The Dispatch will be a guest with his new reporting on Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=318.62s)]
*  Amid speculation, the Democrat may run for president. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=324.34000000000003s)]
*  Also had the stars of the Broadway musical Boop will be live at 30 Rock to discuss the show's three Tony nominations. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=327.58s)]
*  Exceptionally fun to say. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=334.1s)]
*  I'm sure it's going to be an exceptionally fun interview. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=335.26s)]
*  All that when Morning Joe comes just moments away. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIfO6IQ6MM&t=337.14s)]
