**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA)
*  The women between the fertilization and all of the other things that we're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=0.0s)]
*  talking about it's gonna be it's gonna be great. We're joined today. Fertilization. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=4.4s)]
*  I'm still very proud of it. I don't care. I'll be known as the fertilization [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  president that that's okay. The self-described fertilization president [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump and his administration are apparently brainstorming ways to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=28.04s)]
*  persuade women to have more babies. New reporting this week from the New York [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=31.16s)]
*  Times says that some of those ideas include get ready for this, a $5,000 cash [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=34.96s)]
*  baby bonus to new moms, reserving 30% of Fulbright scholarships for those who are [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=39.68s)]
*  married with children, state-funded education programs teaching women about [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=45.5s)]
*  their menstrual cycle so they can better understand when they are ovulating and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=49.68s)]
*  able to conceive and a national medal of motherhood for women with six or more [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=53.96s)]
*  children. My goodness. Joining me now Christina Greer, associate professor of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=60.2s)]
*  political science at Fordham University and co-host of the FAQ NYC podcast. Wow. I [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=63.96s)]
*  have not seen Handmaiden's Tale but I feel like I might want to start. You just [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  lived through it. I mean so here's the thing. You have a president that wants to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=76.16s)]
*  make sure women get pregnant but we have an administration that wants to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=81.12s)]
*  make sure we don't pay for hospitals. We're closing them across the country. We [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=84.68s)]
*  don't support pre-k. We don't support public education. We don't support any [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=88.92s)]
*  sort of medical research or science. The list goes on and on about all the ways [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=93.68s)]
*  they're taking away once a baby is actually here. That's one. Two, we have [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  lots of people who are already in this country who are making families and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=103.0s)]
*  trying to make a way but they're systemically deporting them. They're ripping [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  apart families actually. These conservative acts are saying we want to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  have more families but we have families. We have children who are defending [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  themselves in immigration courts all across this country and you're taking [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=120.28s)]
*  mothers and fathers away from them. So we know what the larger project is. All the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=123.36s)]
*  pictures that they're showing, it's not women that look like me. It's not women [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=128.04s)]
*  of color. This is a much larger project. They're so afraid of 2040 when blacks [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=132.04s)]
*  and Latinos become, you know, people of color are the majority in the nation. And [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  so this is, if you look at who Donald Trump has surrounded himself with, these [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  proto-nationalists, people who believe that women should be in the home raising [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=144.96s)]
*  six plus children. We know Elon Musk subscribes to that with his 14 children. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  Sean Duffy, father of nine. You know, where are the mothers? They are at home [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=153.52s)]
*  where they should be taking care of the family. But as far as government entities [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=157.84s)]
*  are concerned, they don't pay for anything to support a family. This one [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=161.72s)]
*  time $5,000, you and I both know $5,000. That is absolutely nothing. So you don't [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=166.16s)]
*  support women getting insurance. You don't support, you know, research in, I [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=171.72s)]
*  don't know, nutrition. I'm thinking of our good friend Robert Kennedy Jr. I mean [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=176.24s)]
*  the list is so egregious of the things that this administration is taking away [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=180.88s)]
*  from women and families. The audacity to say that they want to actually encourage [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=186.26s)]
*  women to sign up for a life of breeding essentially is really, I kind of have no words. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=191.24s)]
*  Really, if you had known that 30% of Fulbright scholarships were going to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  women who were married and had children, you wouldn't have made a different [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=204.88s)]
*  choice. The whole thing is so preposterous, right? And the fact that you [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=208.8s)]
*  brought the question of how much of this has to do with race. There's also the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=213.96s)]
*  question of what kind of family beyond race that they are talking about. This, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=217.4s)]
*  the New York Times points out, much of the movement is built around promoting a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=221.84s)]
*  very specific idea of what constitutes a family. One that includes marriage [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=224.72s)]
*  between a man and a woman and leaves out many families that don't conform to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=228.6s)]
*  traditional gender roles or family structures. They're reconstituting the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=232.44s)]
*  American family. Right. And we have worked so hard to try and become a more [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  inclusive nation so that we know we can support LGBTQ plus families that have a [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  blended family. We can support families that have used IVF or adoption. We can [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=246.0s)]
*  support women or men who choose to go it alone and start a family as a single [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=251.72s)]
*  person. So we know that none of those things are on the table. But I think we [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=256.72s)]
*  also have to hit home the point. This administration and dare I say the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  Republican Party writ large does not tend to care about Children once they're [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=263.92s)]
*  outside of the womb. They are obsessed with women's wombs and they know very [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=268.04s)]
*  little about menstrual cycles. I'm surprised. Everyone actually sit in on [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=272.52s)]
*  the class. Maybe all members of Congress could join them. We have an eighth grade [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=277.2s)]
*  public health class, I beg because most men, you know, when you say a six week [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=280.44s)]
*  abortion ban, most women have no idea that they're even pregnant. If they knew [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  anything about women's anatomy, they would know that. And so there's this [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  lack of understanding, but a purposeful lack of understanding for certain people [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=292.96s)]
*  in this administration and others actually do know the harm that they're [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=297.24s)]
*  causing and they don't care. And so what's so frustrating and dangerous [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=300.2s)]
*  about this moment is it's couched in this real conservative family values. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=304.76s)]
*  But we know the overarching theme is this larger conservative ideology of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=308.96s)]
*  what a family looks like. But also we can't ignore the racial element. This [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=314.76s)]
*  this has a long standing history in this country about who should be the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=318.56s)]
*  dominant group. We know that the president has talked many times about [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=322.36s)]
*  his good genes and his eugenics. And we know that they want slash need more [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=325.6s)]
*  white people in this country. This is what the mass deportations are about. We [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=330.88s)]
*  know that the way the rules are set up in this country, only white women can [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=334.72s)]
*  make white men, only white women can make white babies. So if that's the case, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=338.04s)]
*  you have to make sure you defund abortion. You have to make sure you make [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=343.48s)]
*  it illegal and criminal. You have to make sure that you make it as easy as [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=346.12s)]
*  possible for white women specifically to be able to have Children, whether it's [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=349.16s)]
*  IVF or whatever it may be, because the idea is to get them back to 100 years [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  ago when white people are the dominant group. How do you [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_lyxXXqQkA&t=358.24s)]
