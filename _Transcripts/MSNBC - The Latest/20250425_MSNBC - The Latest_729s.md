Video Description: Rachel Maddow reports on how protests and a wave of legal actions forced the Trump administration to reverse course on revoking student visas, only the latest in a string of significant policy reversals by Trump after public outcry. At the same time, the unpopularity of Trump's policies does not seem to have discouraged him from enacting further extreme, unpopular measures.

*  The Trump administration has now had to reverse itself and restore the funding Trump had cut [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  for the largest and most important decades long study of women's health. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=339.44s)]

*  saving billions of dollars in the American health system. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  It is a study that started in the 90s. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=355.0s)]
*  It has enrolled over 160,000 American women. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=357.4s)]
*  It is one of the most successful long-term medical studies in the history of science. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=360.73999999999995s)]
*  And Trump just killed it, cut it off midstream with no warning. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=365.79999999999995s)]
*  And now they have had to reverse that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  Now the Trump administration has had to reverse itself on its not at all terrifying plan to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=371.38s)]
*  create a national government registry of autistic people under the authority of Trump [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=375.92s)]
*  HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who of course talks about autistic people as if they [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=382.32s)]
*  are not even human. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=387.48s)]
*  And now he's going to create a universal registry of everyone with an autism diagnosis in the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=389.0s)]
*  United States. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=394.32s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=395.32s)]
*  That was his plan. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=398.8s)]
*  Now he's had to reverse himself on that as well. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=401.28s)]
*  Today the Trump administration has had to reverse itself on cutting food safety scientists [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=406.35999999999996s)]
*  at the FDA. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  Trump's new handpicked FDA commissioner actually went on CNN this week and denied that those [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=413.76s)]
*  scientists had been fired. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=418.44s)]
*  He said, quote, I can tell you there were no cuts to scientists or inspectors. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=419.79999999999995s)]
*  There absolutely were. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=424.44s)]
*  scientists and inspectors cut from food and drug safety labs all across the country, including, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=427.56s)]
*  I should mention, from the veterinary division of FDA, where what they were working on was [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=433.76s)]
*  the bird flu. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=437.8s)]
*  He didn't even know, oh, they haven't been cut. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=441.08s)]
*  Now they've quietly started reinstating all those scientists and inspectors that they [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=443.08s)]
*  actually did cut. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=447.0s)]
*  But they didn't want to admit it, let alone defend it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=448.12s)]
*  And so now they've had to reverse it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=450.68s)]
*  All of those reversals within the last day. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=453.88s)]
*  I mean, listen, it's Friday. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=456.68s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=464.92s)]
*  I run out of things to give by the time we get to Friday. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=465.92s)]
*  Sometimes I'm a little more blunt on Fridays than I am other days. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=469.12s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=472.4s)]
*  It's exhaustion. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=473.4s)]
*  But listen, it's not like we didn't know it was going to be terrible, right? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=474.4s)]
*  This week, after all, it's the five-year anniversary of Trump in his first term telling [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  the country that maybe we should all inject bleach or disinfectants into our bodies, because [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=486.8s)]
*  sure, that would probably take care of COVID, right? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=492.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you remember? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=495.32s)]
*  Lysol had to put out a disclaimer saying, please do not actually inject disinfectant [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=496.32s)]
*  into your body. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=500.68s)]
*  My God, we realize the president just said to do that, but please do not. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=501.68s)]
*  That was five years ago this week. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=506.16s)]
*  We've had time to settle in to what it's like to have Donald Trump in a position of [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=507.96s)]
*  power, right? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=511.15999999999997s)]
*  So it's not like we didn't know it was going to be terrible. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=512.16s)]
*  And it is terrible. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=515.64s)]
*  He really did have a judge arrested today. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  And we will have more on that in a moment. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=519.96s)]
*  But that wasn't all. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=523.36s)]
*  I mean, today we learned that Trump is killing off the federal funding for Narcan. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=525.24s)]
*  Narcan. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=529.88s)]
*  The anti-overdose miracle that has literally saved hundreds of millions of American lives [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=532.52s)]
*  in the last few years. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=538.72s)]
*  There are hundreds, excuse me, hundreds of thousands of Americans who are alive today [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=539.8s)]
*  who would not be alive without Narcan. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=545.28s)]
*  It is a miracle that saves people from overdose. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=547.92s)]
*  And Trump in his first term bragged and bragged and bragged about how much his administration [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=551.72s)]
*  supported Narcan and how much they'd done to make sure everywhere in the country could [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=555.84s)]
*  get Narcan. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=559.84s)]
*  Now he's killing it off. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=562.2s)]
*  And killing off programs to combat opioid addiction at the same time. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=565.08s)]
*  Trump really is completely zeroing out, completely eliminating head start everywhere in the country [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=572.2800000000001s)]
*  because God forbid American kids can go to preschool because that's a terrible thing. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=577.8000000000001s)]
*  Complete termination of that 60-year-old program. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=583.52s)]
*  Trump really is killing off meals on wheels. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=587.08s)]
*  Because heaven forbid old people and disabled people and people with mobility problems get [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=590.32s)]
*  meals delivered to them and somebody to check in on them. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=595.2s)]
*  They're getting rid of the agency that runs that. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  Trump has already fired half the staff from that agency and Trump has closed all 10 of [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=602.8000000000001s)]
*  the regional offices that oversee meals on wheels. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=607.6800000000001s)]
*  Because Donald Trump is against meals on wheels for some reason. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=611.4s)]
*  This was two days ago in Morgantown, West Virginia. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=619.12s)]
*  People out protesting against Trump firing nearly everyone. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=623.0799999999999s)]
*  85% of people at NIOSH, the Occupational Safety and Health Agency that oversees coal mines. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=627.04s)]
*  People out in West Virginia protesting that two days ago. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=635.1s)]
*  Trump has cut the mine health and safety administration and the agencies that serve coal miners. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=639.16s)]
*  And West Virginia is up in arms about it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=646.96s)]
*  We knew it was going to be bad and it is bad. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=652.72s)]
*  But the American people, God bless them, God bless us. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=656.52s)]
*  The American people is under no illusions about it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=661.92s)]
*  And the American people is very broadly and now very consistently and very, very affirmatively [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=665.12s)]
*  against what Trump is doing. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=671.68s)]
*  Even the stuff that he thinks you'll like, that he says for political effect, the American [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=673.9s)]
*  public is resoundingly saying no to all of it. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=677.6s)]
*  And they're saying no in the polls and they're saying no in the streets. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=682.22s)]
*  And that, in the end, with the courts, that's going to be the only thing that matters. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=689.66s)]
*  He's not even 100 days in and we are in desperation mode from him already. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=695.12s)]
*  Arresting a judge today. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=699.0s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=700.5200000000001s)]
*  That is a sign of weakness, not strength. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=703.0400000000001s)]
*  It is the public that is being strong here and he cannot handle it. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCn4cTTdYM&t=705.32s)]
