# 'Truly unprecedented': Lawyer for family of mother deported with U.S. citizen child speaks out
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8)
*  Joining us now is Serene Shabaya, National Immigration Project Executive Director, who [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=0.0s)]
*  is representing one of the families impacted. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  And Norm Eisen, he is the chair of State Democracy Defenders Fund and former special counsel [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=7.44s)]
*  and special assistant to President Obama. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=13.0s)]
*  Serene, the White House says these mothers wanted to bring their children with them when [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=15.76s)]
*  they were deported. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=19.2s)]
*  You say that's not true. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=20.2s)]
*  What can you tell us about the family you represent? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=21.88s)]
*  Thank you, Anna. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  What I want to tell you is that the moms were picked up at what should have been a very [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=27.08s)]
*  routine ICE check-in. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=31.4s)]
*  They were there with their children, and then they were whisked away and essentially held [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=32.82s)]
*  without communication with the outside world. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  The first mom was there for three full days. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=40.28s)]
*  There were multiple outreaches made to immigration authorities providing information about the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=43.34s)]
*  availability at all times of a legal custodian to take the U.S. citizen child, requesting [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=48.2s)]
*  legal visits, requesting a meaningful conversation between mom and dad so that they could jointly [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=54.2s)]
*  kind of talk about the best interests of the child and what the options were. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  And all of those requests were denied by immigration authorities who were fully aware of the situation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=64.08s)]
*  The second mom was brought in on Thursday morning, and then within 24 hours, the deportation [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=69.64s)]
*  of both parents happened. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=75.2s)]
*  And with the second mom, one of her kids actually is in late stage cancer treatment. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  He has stage four, a very rare form of stage four cancer. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=82.0s)]
*  He was undergoing cancer treatment. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=84.76s)]
*  The mom specifically objected to her kids being taken with her, you know, in part for [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=87.4s)]
*  that reason, and asked to speak to an attorney on the outside. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=93.04s)]
*  The attorney was asking to speak to her, and none of that happened. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=96.76s)]
*  There was a request for a stay of deportation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  You know, like, I think the picture that's being given by Mr. Homan and others is simply [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=103.32s)]
*  false. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  That is not what was happening in the situation. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  After mom thought that they had any choice in the situation, they were simply told that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=110.84s)]
*  their children were going with them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  And the attorneys and family members and community supporters on the outside who were trying [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=117.16s)]
*  to reach them were forbidden from doing so. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=121.56s)]
*  So it was very much a situation of being under duress and being forced to get on a 6 a.m. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  flight, you know, after being hidden from the world for a period of time. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  And so they have now been removed from this country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=133.68s)]
*  What are you doing to try to get these children back to the states? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=136.36s)]
*  Well, so there is an open court case on behalf of VML, the two-year-old U.S. citizen child. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=140.96s)]
*  We are also in regular communication with the attorneys for the other two U.S. citizen [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=147.16s)]
*  children. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=152.52s)]
*  We're exploring all of those options. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=153.52s)]
*  And I do want to point out, actually, that there's another part of this narrative that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=155.14s)]
*  is simply untrue, which is neither of those moms came here illegally. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=159.28s)]
*  They were both coming. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=163.56s)]
*  One of them came as an asylum seeker, and the other one came as an unaccompanied child. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=164.78s)]
*  And for reasons that were completely beyond their control, they got in absentia orders [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  of removal, meaning they were issued without their presence. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=173.22s)]
*  So neither of those moms ever actually had a chance to really present their own legal [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  cases for being in the United States. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  And so I think we're exploring all of the different legal options that are out there [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  to remedy the lack of due process and the harm that has been visited on both those families. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=186.88s)]
*  Well, we really appreciate you bringing us all the context around these cases, helping [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=192.0s)]
*  us understand some of the dynamics in play. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=195.84s)]
*  Norm, we've also talked about the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case where someone with protected [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  status was deported to that notorious prison in El Salvador. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=203.8s)]
*  And now we're talking here about U.S. citizens who were removed. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=207.44s)]
*  What alarm bells does this ring? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=211.24s)]
*  Anna, the United States Supreme Court has said nine nothing in these illegal abduction cases [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=213.76s)]
*  because that's what you have here. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=223.96s)]
*  The government is abducting people and shipping them out of the country. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=225.52s)]
*  And nine nothing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  Even Donald Trump's strongest supporters on the right wing of that Supreme Court has said, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=231.16s)]
*  hey, all people in the United States are entitled to due process. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  And what we just heard was the series of shocking violations of due process of the Constitution. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=241.72s)]
*  It's part of a larger pattern. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=248.88s)]
*  100 days of the Trump administration, 100 days of constitutional violations. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  My organization, the State Democracy Defenders Fund, represents almost three dozen conservatives, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=257.68s)]
*  Anna. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=264.36s)]
*  Every presidential administration from Nixon to Trump won that has filed briefs in these [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=265.36s)]
*  cases saying this is not constitutional, this is not due process, this is not American, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=270.88s)]
*  and it's not conservative. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=278.4s)]
*  Donald Trump represents a total break. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=280.84s)]
*  The good news is there's been massive court pushback. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  It's not only 100 days of constitutional and legal violations. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  It's almost 100 orders declaring them illegal. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=290.96s)]
*  It's 100 days of failure by Donald Trump. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=294.0s)]
*  We must continue to push because this is not what America's about. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=296.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, Serene, not only have we seen all the heavy lifting that many lawyers like yourself [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=302.23999999999995s)]
*  and Norm have gotten involved in here with these different cases and controversial moves [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=307.16s)]
*  from this Trump administration, but we've also seen a reshaping of the Department of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=313.72s)]
*  Justice. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=317.04s)]
*  We've learned in recent days more than 100 lawyers have left the Justice Department's [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=318.04s)]
*  Civil Rights Division after changes that Attorney General Bondi made to civil rights enforcement. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=322.36s)]
*  How significant are those changes that you may have seen in enforcement in just these [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=328.4s)]
*  first 100 days of this administration? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  I think the changes are extremely significant, Ana, because it is truly unprecedented to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=337.04s)]
*  remove someone, for example, because they told the court the truth. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=341.36s)]
*  That is actually an oath that as attorneys, we swear. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=345.48s)]
*  And in the attorney, for example, representing the government in the Kilmar-Abrego Garcia [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=348.56s)]
*  case, my understanding is that he was removed from his position because he told the court [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=355.24s)]
*  the truth about what was happening when asked the question. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=359.20000000000005s)]
*  And I don't know all the details of that case, but it does seem like there have been many [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=362.20000000000005s)]
*  instances of that. And what it means is that it makes it much harder to in good faith try [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=366.20000000000005s)]
*  to resolve legal issues that are clear before even going to court. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=371.52000000000004s)]
*  And this case is actually the case of the U.S. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  Citizens and Children is a very good example of that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=377.16s)]
*  Our attorneys reached out to government attorneys to say, look, this is a very obvious situation. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=379.76000000000005s)]
*  You have a two year old U.S. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=384.92s)]
*  citizen child. You have legal custodians ready to take them. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  There's no need to go to court. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=389.48s)]
*  Let's just figure this out. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=390.8s)]
*  And they just simply refuse to do that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=392.76000000000005s)]
*  So like we're seeing a certain intransigence and just like, you know, a dishonesty, to be [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=394.72s)]
*  honest, in the way that these cases are being handled, which is truly not how we would [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=399.8s)]
*  expect to relate. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=404.52s)]
*  I mean, we're on obvious that we're on opposite sides of the fence, but we normally have [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=405.96s)]
*  very good abilities to kind of communicate with government attorneys. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=410.24s)]
*  And this has really not been the case recently. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=413.52s)]
*  And Norm, you talk about these first 100 days and a defining feature of this presidency [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=416.12s)]
*  so far being court fights. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=423.48s)]
*  NBC has counted more than 200 lawsuits against the administration so far. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=425.0s)]
*  Where do you see the rule of law in the next one thousand three hundred sixty two days [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=428.8s)]
*  of this presidency? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, on a at State Democracy Defenders Fund, we've been involved in dozens, dozens [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=437.8s)]
*  and dozens of those cases. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=443.72s)]
*  I think of these 100 days as like the rounds of a heavyweight championship fight. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=445.72s)]
*  This was round one. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  The first 100 days, they'll be 14 more rounds. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=457.16s)]
*  But in round one, Donald Trump's flood, the zone of unconstitutional illegal behavior, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=460.24s)]
*  deporting American citizens, for heaven's sake, has been met with rule of law shock [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=467.56s)]
*  and awe. And he has lost again and again in court, including in these foreign [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=473.28s)]
*  abduction cases and in so many more. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  I'll be back in court tomorrow where we got an order protecting 6000 FBI agents from [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=483.64s)]
*  Donald Trump and his administration's attack. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=489.8s)]
*  Last week, we saw more than seven preliminary injunctions and other emergency relief in [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFs39xhUC8&t=492.88s)]
