# From ‘Little Marco’ to being ‘so respected’: Analyzing Trump’s changing opinion on Rubio
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs)
*  And joining us now NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Julie Serkin and New York Times diplomatic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=0.0s)]
*  correspondent Michael Crowley. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=5.2s)]
*  Julie, the hearing just got underway. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=6.84s)]
*  What kinds of questions are senators expected to ask their old colleague? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=8.72s)]
*  Well, Democrats certainly will not give Rubio the same reception he had about four months [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=12.56s)]
*  ago when they voted 99 to 0 unanimously to confirm him as the first cabinet official [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=17.68s)]
*  in the second Trump term. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=23.04s)]
*  This time Democrats have a lot of questions for him about the administration's foreign [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=24.84s)]
*  policy, about the gutting of USAID that he now oversees or whatever is left of it, and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=29.04s)]
*  about the dueling wars that the president has not tampered down yet despite pledging [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=34.0s)]
*  to do so on his first day, especially about those budget cuts, of course, is the purpose [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=38.4s)]
*  of the hearing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=42.62s)]
*  What you're seeing now on your screen are actually code pink protesters that were seated [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=43.7s)]
*  in the back of the room. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=48.18s)]
*  Of course, Republicans in control of the Senate say they have no, they're not going to let [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=49.68s)]
*  those protests stand by. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  They're going to, of course, get this hearing going. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=55.56s)]
*  But I want you to take a listen to what Democrats told us last night that they're looking to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=57.84s)]
*  press Rubio on. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  ...particularly concerned with what's happening in Gaza. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  I think the situation there is desperate. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  I certainly want to understand better his analysis of due process. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  I want to understand his viewpoint on the feeding AID into the woodshipper. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=77.84s)]
*  I'd like to hear about the State Department reorganization. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=86.16s)]
*  I'd like to hear about what he's planning to do with career foreign service officers. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=88.88s)]
*  Look, I can't tell you how disappointed I am in Secretary Rubio. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=92.32s)]
*  I regret casting my vote for him. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=96.72s)]
*  Senator Van Hollen is not the only Democrat that feels that way because a lot of the positions [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=100.32s)]
*  that Rubio is now helping the administration implement in his role as secretary of state [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  and some of the other ones you outlined, he was completely on the other side of it during [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=108.12s)]
*  his term as senator here for about a decade. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=112.02s)]
*  Julius Erkin, thanks so much. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=114.92s)]
*  Keep us posted. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=116.44s)]
*  Michael, so much ground to cover for these senators, the Ukraine war, the Mideast crisis, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=117.44s)]
*  slashing of USAID and the State Department revoking student visas, how he's taken on [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=122.84s)]
*  so many jobs. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=127.48s)]
*  There's also Signalgate. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  Where should they focus, do you think? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=130.68s)]
*  It's going to be hard to focus. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=135.64s)]
*  I think there's going to be a lot of lashing out and frustration for starters because he [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=137.8s)]
*  was confirmed unanimously, including with the support of all his Democratic colleagues. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=141.96s)]
*  And I think there's just a general sense of disappointment. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  I think they were expecting more from Rubio, although I think as we've seen from the first [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=149.4s)]
*  Trump administration, if you stray too far from the Trump line, you get bumped out pretty [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=154.12s)]
*  quickly. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  So, you know, they have to understand that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  But, look, Ukraine, I think, is the hot issue of the moment. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  We should expect a lot of questions about that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=167.52s)]
*  Michael, Rubio has talked about a plan to cut State Department staff by 15 percent, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=169.68s)]
*  to close more than 100 bureaus worldwide. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=174.24s)]
*  He says 83 percent of USAID's programs are already gone. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=177.08s)]
*  This is the first time senators will get to ask Rubio about all of this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  Just based on your reporting, are changes at this point done? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  And how has all of this fundamentally shifted American diplomacy? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, this is still moving through the courts. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=194.0s)]
*  But it's going to be extremely difficult to reverse it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=198.04s)]
*  I don't think USAID is coming back in this administration. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=200.16s)]
*  And I think there will be a lot of questions. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=204.72s)]
*  You know, it's still not entirely clear how this all happened. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=206.52s)]
*  It happened so fast. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=211.12s)]
*  It was Trump's first target. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=212.12s)]
*  It was very surprising to people. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=213.32s)]
*  Democrats have a lot of questions about this, but I don't think they're going to get to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=215.6s)]
*  the bottom of it at this hearing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=218.16s)]
*  Their concern is that if we are chopping foreign aid and shutting down a lot of these essential [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=219.56s)]
*  programs in countries around the world, that our rivals will fill the void, most especially [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  including China. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=229.83999999999997s)]
*  We're locked in a soft power so-called competition with China around the world. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=230.83999999999997s)]
*  And if we withdraw these programs that give America so much goodwill, China stands to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=235.16s)]
*  benefit. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=238.44s)]
*  As we laid out, Michael, the president has given Rubio enough jobs for four people. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=239.92s)]
*  These are big jobs. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=243.88s)]
*  He's serving as interim national security advisor, acting administrator of USAID and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=245.04s)]
*  acting administrator of the National Archives. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=250.6s)]
*  Clearly, the president trusts him. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=254.04s)]
*  Here's what the president said last night, in fact. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=256.12s)]
*  He was born for this. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=258.12s)]
*  He loves it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=260.6s)]
*  You see him. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=261.6s)]
*  He's in one country, another country. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=262.6s)]
*  I think he loves it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=264.88s)]
*  But he's so respected everywhere he goes. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=266.52s)]
*  And I know how tough he is because I used to have to be up there with him. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=269.68s)]
*  He was not nice. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=272.4s)]
*  He was a tough one. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=273.4s)]
*  He was as good as you get. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=276.36s)]
*  I didn't know that we would end up being this close. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=278.64s)]
*  Actually, we like each other. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=281.72s)]
*  Quite a shift from calling him little Marco. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=284.72s)]
*  But what are the risks of relying on one person so closely? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=287.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, in general, the risks are that you, you know, ideally, you sort [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=294.56s)]
*  of want a team of rivals or at least a variety of opinions, different viewpoints that are [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=299.2s)]
*  competing and you sort of hash out the best ideas that come from all these different [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  perspectives. And when you narrow the perspectives and in this case, what we're really talking [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  about is secretary of state and national security adviser. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=314.0s)]
*  You might limit the options that you're given, particularly, you know, as national security [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=317.44s)]
*  adviser, by the way, the first person since Henry Kissinger to hold both the national [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=321.72s)]
*  security adviser and secretary of state job as national security adviser, Rubio is running [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=325.56s)]
*  the whole what they call interagency process to come up with options for the president. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=330.24s)]
*  But if he's also secretary of state, he's got a natural bias toward the state department, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=334.56s)]
*  whereas the national security adviser is supposed to be an impartial arbiter balancing [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=339.32s)]
*  state, Justice Department, Pentagon, all these different agencies. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=343.2s)]
*  So that is a potential risk. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And how do you devote enough time and attention to each of these individual jobs [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=348.68s)]
*  to ensure that each of these areas are given proper vetting, education, all the different [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=352.84s)]
*  pieces that are needed in the rules that fall under them? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=360.84s)]
*  Thank you, Michael Crowley, for joining us and offering your insights and your recording. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtTtaFbuLs&t=363.71999999999997s)]
