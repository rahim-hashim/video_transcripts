# GOP Shakeup? All eyes on the midterms with key Senate seats up for grabs
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg)
*  So, I wouldn't put any stake whatsoever in what Democrats are saying right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=0.0s)]
*  Remember, they were assured that we were going to lose the majority last fall. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=4.8s)]
*  Well, we're going to pick up seats. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=8.08s)]
*  We're going to flip Democrat seats. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=9.8s)]
*  And we'll teach them once again they shouldn't underestimate us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=11.8s)]
*  No concerns at all cost you any seats? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=14.44s)]
*  No concerns at all. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=16.12s)]
*  In fact, it's going to gain seats for us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=17.12s)]
*  We're that confident. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=19.12s)]
*  That's bold. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=20.72s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson a bit earlier this week with this prediction that President Trump's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=21.72s)]
*  big beautiful bill will help Republicans gain seats in next year's midterms. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=25.16s)]
*  Those comments, though, come as a poll. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=30.04s)]
*  I'm going to talk about, matter of fact, rather poll after poll after poll continues to show [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=31.76s)]
*  that the legislation is unpopular with the American public. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=36.4s)]
*  And joining us now, we have former communications director and spokesman for Congressman Hakeem [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=39.92s)]
*  Jeffries Michael Hardaway and senior MSNBC political contributor and analyst Matthew [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=44.08s)]
*  Dowd. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  So welcome to you both. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Matthew, as Republicans are they're trying to spin this Trump mega bill, but there's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  an increasing focus on the midterms and keeping Senate control. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=55.64s)]
*  And we have this development. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=59.12s)]
*  You have Republican Texas state Senator Angela Paxton, who's just filed for divorce from [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=61.12s)]
*  husband Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general and Senate hopeful on quote biblical grounds. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=66.46s)]
*  The Texas Tribune reporting that this divorce filing cites adultery. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=74.0s)]
*  Paxton is challenging the incumbent Senator John Cornyn. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=77.96s)]
*  The race, Paxton is consistently led against Senator rather Senate Republican wishes. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=80.5s)]
*  Why do you think the party is nervous about Paxton and where do you see his political [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=86.25999999999999s)]
*  future? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=90.94s)]
*  Well, they're nervous about Paxton living here in Texas is because he's highly unpopular in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=94.05999999999999s)]
*  the general electorate. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=98.82s)]
*  And so he's very popular among Republican primary voters, which is why John Cornyn, the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  incumbent, is vulnerable and is behind right now. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  But he's highly unpopular because of investigations of him on fraud, all sorts of things, his [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=107.02s)]
*  conduct in office, all those sorts of this, not the least of which is this latest story. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=112.61999999999999s)]
*  But my view on this latest story is I know Republicans and I know the NRC has sort of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=116.82s)]
*  launched a thing at him based on this. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  I don't understand how they can do that when they have a president in the Oval Office who [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=123.78s)]
*  cheated on his first wife with his second wife, cheated on his second wife with his third [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=128.54s)]
*  wife and cheated on his third wife with a porn star. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=132.54s)]
*  I don't get how they think, OK, all of a sudden this makes Paxton vulnerable when the guy [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  they're going to use to campaign for whoever the candidate is, is sitting in the Oval Office as [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=139.82s)]
*  president of the United States. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=144.1s)]
*  I will say I believe Texas is considered to be part of the Bible Belt, so it does make you sort [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=145.9s)]
*  of wonder the definition there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=150.78s)]
*  But you have Politico reporting, Matthew, that Republican Senator Joni Ernst is on the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  fence right now about running for a third term next year. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=157.34s)]
*  And that's according to three sources. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=159.46s)]
*  Ernst won handily in both of her previous Senate bids. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=161.38s)]
*  So is this a seat that Senate Republicans should be worrying about? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=164.94s)]
*  Yes, I mean, I've always thought that Iowa should sort of go back to being a swing state and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=169.86s)]
*  being very competitive in the course of this, just like North Carolina with Tom Tillis [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=175.62s)]
*  leaving, I think is exceedingly competitive. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=179.74s)]
*  And I think Democrats are likely to pick it up. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=181.74s)]
*  The other thing Republicans are eyeing, not only are individual problems, Alex, but they're [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=184.02s)]
*  also this generally midterms are usually bad for the incumbent party. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=188.66s)]
*  They're bad when a president has a 41 percent job approval rating and they're even worse when you [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=192.22s)]
*  have a unpopular policy that they pushed that the Democrats will be actually creating a whole [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=196.74s)]
*  storyline around. So bad midterm, bad presidential numbers combined with a bad policy that is [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=202.1s)]
*  passed is makes these people wonder, should I retire and not go through this? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=208.86s)]
*  So, Michael, part of the reason Republicans have been able to gain control over Congress, it's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=213.98s)]
*  because they got the largest preponderance and gaining ground with low income voters. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=218.85999999999999s)]
*  Right. It's a group that is going to bear the brunt of the cost of President Trump's big, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=223.5s)]
*  beautiful bill. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=228.14s)]
*  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says that is going to allow openings for Democrats next year. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=229.1s)]
*  Do you think Democrats will be able to effectively argue their case despite their consistently low [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=235.5s)]
*  approval ratings recently? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=243.01999999999998s)]
*  Democrats have such a perfect case. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=245.06s)]
*  Republicans just passed this wildly unpopular bill that takes health care away from millions of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  people and destroys the jobs of several hundred thousand others. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=252.22s)]
*  If Democrats can't sell this, they're in the wrong business. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=255.94s)]
*  But we have to be honest and we have to be clear. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=258.42s)]
*  Republicans will try to disinform and they'll lie and they'll and they'll misdirect. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=260.38s)]
*  But Democrats have to tell voters, your life is worse under Donald Trump and this is why. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=265.82s)]
*  Democrats have to remain disciplined in that way. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=270.74s)]
*  Messaging is what you're talking about. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=274.02s)]
*  Yes, it fixes everything. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=275.18s)]
*  It really does. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=277.06s)]
*  So there's a lack of uniformity in message or a lack of willing to, I guess, punch back in the same [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=277.7s)]
*  way they're being punched. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=283.82s)]
*  I mean, you know, go high, go high or go low, go low. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=284.94s)]
*  Go low. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=287.86s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=288.7s)]
*  Play the game as it is being played. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=289.02s)]
*  First of all, the economy is in free fall thanks to Donald Trump. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=290.98s)]
*  Second of all, you've got this bill that has really destroyed the careers of so many people in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=294.46s)]
*  energy, in E.V. and in others. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=299.62s)]
*  And there's no answer for that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=302.1s)]
*  Democrats have to make them pay. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=303.38s)]
*  Let's imagine a hypothetical world. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=305.78000000000003s)]
*  OK, here it is. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=308.22s)]
*  Ernst retires. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=309.7s)]
*  You have former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, who is entering his state's race. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=310.9s)]
*  You have Democrats who recruit a strong challenge, let's say, in Maine that will challenge the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=316.42s)]
*  incumbent Senator Susan Collins. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  And then you have this Texas situation with the attorney general, Ken Paxton, who wins the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=322.58s)]
*  primary, who Democrats believe they'd like him to be the primary candidate because they think [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=326.3s)]
*  they can beat him. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=330.86s)]
*  If all that happens, do Democrats take back the Senate? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=332.14000000000004s)]
*  It's very close, but they could. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=335.46000000000004s)]
*  And by the way, back to Colin Allred, he's within five points of both Republican candidates. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=336.90000000000003s)]
*  And so whether it's Paxton or whether it's Cornyn, it doesn't really matter. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=341.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=344.78000000000003s)]
*  Send your money and support to Colin Allred so he can win that seat. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=345.1s)]
*  But overall, it is very possible if Democrats do this correctly and focus on pocketbook [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=347.90000000000003s)]
*  issues that we can get back to the majority in the House and the Senate in the midterms. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=353.3s)]
*  Matthew, do you see this as being possible as well? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=358.54s)]
*  Do you agree it could happen? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=361.42s)]
*  Yeah, I agree it can happen. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=363.70000000000005s)]
*  But the least of the problem, the least of the thing that the Democrats will do is shorten [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=365.06s)]
*  the margin in the United States Senate. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=368.82000000000005s)]
*  And as you know, Alex, a number of the key bills passed with the vote of the vice president [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=370.5s)]
*  because it was tied. So, right, even if they take two seats back and they have the Republicans [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=374.94000000000005s)]
*  having to see majority, it makes it very hard for the Republicans to govern in the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=379.74s)]
*  Senate in after 2026. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0lfuBLbZXg&t=384.06s)]
