# Trump 'turning the military on its own people': L.A. Councilman reacts to National Guard called
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk)
*  Joining us now is Los Angeles City Councilmember Hugo Soto Martinez. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=0.0s)]
*  Councilman, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=4.2s)]
*  What's your reaction to the upheaval in your city right now? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=5.8s)]
*  Well, you know, this is pretty unprecedented what's happening in Los Angeles. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  You know, we have the president turning the military on its own people, creating this [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=14.32s)]
*  chaos. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=19.04s)]
*  You know, what we've seen is every single action that he's done, you know, the day he [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=20.04s)]
*  sent ICE agents to schools. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=24.0s)]
*  In my district, I had a middle school student get visited by ICE. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=27.0s)]
*  Luckily, she wasn't there when they arrived. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=30.96s)]
*  Denying care, trying to deport a four-year-old with life-saving care, which is also in my [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=33.8s)]
*  district. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  You know, this was caused completely by the president. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  And so for him to say that it's us that is the problem, I think it's completely hypocritical. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=43.32s)]
*  Overnight, we did see cars set on fire, reports of rocks being thrown and fireworks being [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=48.72s)]
*  fired at law enforcement, reports of looting at businesses, the L.A. police chief saying [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=55.6s)]
*  now maybe more National Guard troops should be called up. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=61.32s)]
*  What do you think is needed to de-escalate at this point? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think this is where elected leaders such as myself and other folks that have a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=67.84s)]
*  platform need to remind people that what is it that we're trying to accomplish? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=73.28s)]
*  And what we're trying to accomplish is to keep families together. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=78.72s)]
*  We know so many folks that we love, that we care, that are being ripped apart. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=82.68s)]
*  And that's what we need to focus on right now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=86.72s)]
*  You know, the small level of, you know, disturbances that we have, it's a distraction. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=89.24s)]
*  But we need to be disciplined. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=94.92s)]
*  We need to march peacefully. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=96.6s)]
*  We need to call out the administration for what they're doing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=98.36s)]
*  But let's keep our message. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  We're here to protect our families and keep this city safe. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  The police chief mentioned last night that they had very little interaction with the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=106.08s)]
*  National Guard. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=109.2s)]
*  The city councilwoman, Maxine Waters, had tried to access the building where the National [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  Guard is stationed. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  She was denied entry. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  Has the city council been given any information about what the National Guard mission is, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=116.88s)]
*  what they're doing? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  What questions do you have? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  You know, we've been getting very little information about their role. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=124.8s)]
*  You know, again, we have, you know, this federal administration that is just trying to bully [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=128.84s)]
*  their way into our city. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=132.88s)]
*  We didn't ask for this help. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=134.8s)]
*  You know, we know how to deal with protests. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  We know how to deal with our own people. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=138.6s)]
*  But by him sending these federal troops in, it's just agitating the situation. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=140.6s)]
*  And what we have heard from people on the front line is that people are being denied [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=145.56s)]
*  access to their clients. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  Lawyers can't go in. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=152.16s)]
*  They can't get, the family members can't get in contact with them. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=153.16s)]
*  So many things that used to happen are not happening anymore. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=156.12s)]
*  But it just goes to show you that this administration is trying to create chaos. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=160.44s)]
*  Trying to create this disorder by doing things such as denying access to their attorneys. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=164.24s)]
*  President Trump has now repeatedly called the people taking to the streets insurrectionists. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=169.44s)]
*  What's your response? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=174.28s)]
*  Look, the real insurrection happened on January 6th. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=176.28s)]
*  And the president decided to pardon every single one of them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=179.96s)]
*  This is not an insurrection. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=183.4s)]
*  These are people that are trying to fight to keep their families together. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=184.96s)]
*  You know, where I remember when I when I was younger, I used to pick up my my brothers [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=189.08s)]
*  and sisters from, you know, Russell Elementary School. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=193.72s)]
*  I visited that school. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=197.08s)]
*  And so these these what we're hearing about this federal administration doing is very [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=198.52s)]
*  close to us. Not a single person in the city of Los Angeles is being unaffected by his [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=202.68s)]
*  policy. So, you know, again, complete hypocrisy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=207.8s)]
*  The real insurrection happened January 6th. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=211.2s)]
*  The Trump administration says more immigration raids are to be expected. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=213.24s)]
*  And they said anybody who gets in the way could be potentially, you know, arrested for [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=217.28s)]
*  obstruction or interfering in a federal investigation. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=222.88s)]
*  Can you just tell us a little bit more about the area of Paramount where the initial [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=226.0s)]
*  immigration raids happen, kicking off all of this upheaval? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=232.24s)]
*  You know, Los Angeles is a very diverse region and Paramount and those sort of gateway [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  cities, you know, they represent working class Latinos. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=242.56s)]
*  You know, when people come first come to Los Angeles, they come to East L.A. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=246.4s)]
*  or South Central and as they become, you know, climb the social ladder, get a better job, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=251.2s)]
*  try to settle in. Many of them go to the gateway cities because it's a lot of single [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=256.24s)]
*  family homes. And so those are working class people that are just trying to live the American [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=259.36s)]
*  dream and sending ICE agents, you know, to try to round people up. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  It's just it's going to cause a reaction. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=269.48s)]
*  People are going to be upset. But again, we're asking people to to go and protest, but [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=271.36s)]
*  protest peacefully. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  L.A. Councilman Hugo Soto Martinez, thank you very much for taking the time and providing [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=277.6s)]
*  some insight into what's happening in your city right now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xpF_ajvIk&t=283.44s)]
