# ‘Migrants today, who knows what tomorrow?’: Michigan official on White House attacks on due process
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI)
*  NEWS 2. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=0.0s)]
*  New today, the Trump administration says it's considering suspending habeas corpus, the constitutional [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=1.0s)]
*  right of a person to challenge their detention in court. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  A number of ongoing cases challenging migrant deportations are based on habeas claims. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=9.84s)]
*  Here's President Trump's deputy chief of staff. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Well, the constitution is clear, and that of course is the supreme law of the land, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=17.8s)]
*  that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=23.62s)]
*  So to say that's an option we're actively looking at. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=29.12s)]
*  Look, a lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=31.16s)]
*  Joining us now, Jocelyn Benson, Michigan's secretary of state. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=36.36s)]
*  She is also running for governor, and her new book is called The Purposeful Lawyer, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=39.32s)]
*  Standing Up for What's Right When the Stakes Are High. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=43.84s)]
*  Before we can get to your book, I do want to ask you, can you break down why habeas [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=46.72s)]
*  corpus is such a critical element of our constitution? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=50.6s)]
*  I mean, it's like the one thing I remember from our con law class, and I think it's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=53.44s)]
*  because the professor just hit it over and over again. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=57.04s)]
*  It basically means produce the body, and the point is you should get to have a venue by [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=59.52s)]
*  which to defend yourself. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  So what does it mean if it goes away, even if it's just for migrants, as the White House [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=65.64s)]
*  says it wants? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=69.66s)]
*  Yeah, migrants today, who knows what else tomorrow, or democracy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=71.08s)]
*  And you know, habeas corpus is basically the idea that if you have a legal case to make [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=74.88s)]
*  that someone broke the law, you need to produce evidence in a court of law under oath that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=79.52s)]
*  crime actually occurred. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=85.36s)]
*  And it's particularly ironic, given everything we dealt with after the 2020 election, all [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=87.48s)]
*  of these attacks on the rule of law and our democracy with zero evidence, and that there [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=91.92s)]
*  was that the election was anything but an accurate reflection of the will of the people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=98.0s)]
*  So evidence is key, but this administration seems to consistently disregard it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=102.44s)]
*  It can't in the rule of law, and that's what habeas corpus is meant to protect. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=107.12s)]
*  And Stephen Miller there at the end added, it depends on whether or not the courts do [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=112.2s)]
*  the right thing or not. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=115.9s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=117.54s)]
*  Do you think that's a shot across the bow directly at judges? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=118.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is said in the context of judges being arrested for actually trying [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=122.2s)]
*  to do the right thing, right, enforce the laws written, uphold the Constitution. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=129.36s)]
*  So I see that for, if I was the judge, I would see that as a, I would say, yeah, I'm going [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=134.1s)]
*  I'm going to follow the law and protect the Constitution. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=139.72s)]
*  But in another context, it certainly does sound like a threat to induce fear in judges [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=142.64s)]
*  if they don't follow what the president wants. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=148.44s)]
*  But I believe in the rule of law. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=151.24s)]
*  I believe that judges in our judicial branch at the state and federal level are going to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=152.64s)]
*  consistently uphold the law, just as they did after the 2020 election, and require evidence [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=157.6s)]
*  of wrongdoing before convicting someone of a crime. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=162.68s)]
*  We've actually seen that, you know, from the bipartisan group of judges, even Trump-appointed [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=166.4s)]
*  judges have put a pause on some of these policies. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=170.0s)]
*  I also want to ask you, we thought new today, the Trump administration says it's going to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=172.8s)]
*  appeal this temporary order from a judge pausing its workforce reduction plans. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=176.60000000000002s)]
*  The judge says she believed there's no statute that gives the White House agencies the authority [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=181.62s)]
*  to direct other federal agencies to engage in these large-scale terminations, restructurings [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=185.8s)]
*  or eliminations. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=191.56s)]
*  How do you interpret this order, and what does it mean for laid-off federal workers? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=193.0s)]
*  Well, the administration is appealing, so this is not the end of the story. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=198.04s)]
*  But it's very gratifying to see the judge, again, uphold the law and recognize that the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=202.84s)]
*  executive branch has no authority to just indiscriminately fire federal workers and, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=208.36s)]
*  frankly, also cause a lot of harm as a result. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=213.36s)]
*  You know, I run one of our state's largest agencies. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=215.76s)]
*  In addition to running elections, I'm also the chief motor vehicle officer for the state [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  of Michigan. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=221.16s)]
*  And we've been able to actually cut costs, reduce red tape, cut through bureaucracy and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=223.12s)]
*  save people time and money, improve efficiency, everything Doge is claiming to do. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=228.56s)]
*  We've been able to do it in Michigan without a chainsaw, without firing people indiscriminately. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=233.12s)]
*  So the proper way to respond to an order like this is to try to increase, actually increase [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=237.72s)]
*  the efficiency of federal government and eliminate red tape and bureaucracy without firing people [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=242.28s)]
*  who are actually probably the best suited to be able to accomplish those very goals. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=247.12s)]
*  You mentioned earlier the climate following 2020. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=252.52s)]
*  And in your book, The Purposeful Warrior, that comes out this week, you recount your [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=255.44s)]
*  experience where you had armed protesters surrounding your home to protest Donald Trump's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=259.8s)]
*  2020 election loss while you say your son was inside watching a Christmas movie. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=264.4s)]
*  Talk to us about what that was like and how it impacted your career. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=269.14s)]
*  You know, the uncertainty of that moment is never forgotten. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=272.92s)]
*  The fear that, you know, what's going to happen? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=277.76s)]
*  For 45 minutes, all that stood between my home, myself and my four-year-old son, and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=280.52000000000004s)]
*  this growing mob of armed protesters was one neighborhood security guard. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=285.68s)]
*  And so, you know, my job in that moment was to keep my son safe and maintain calm demeanor, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=289.8s)]
*  which I worked to do while also being on the phone with the attorney general, as I recount [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=295.92s)]
*  in the opening of the book. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=299.44s)]
*  But at the same time, I found a purpose in that moment through the fear that was rooted [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  in a recognition that these folks weren't protesting me. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  They were protesting my job, my role to protect the will of the people, protect the rule of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=309.56s)]
*  law, protect the outcome of that accurate election. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  And so I became emboldened, actually, in that moment to do even more, to stand firm up for [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=317.08s)]
*  what's right, even though the stakes were high, because my job in that moment was to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=322.44s)]
*  protect the will of the people. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=326.4s)]
*  And I was more proud than ever to stand guard over that will of the people, those accurate [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=327.78s)]
*  election results, in the aftermath of those protests. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=331.79999999999995s)]
*  But those angry voters, even a couple years later now, are still out there. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=335.68s)]
*  So how would you describe the political climate in Michigan these days? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=340.12s)]
*  Is it even possible to win some of them over? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=343.12s)]
*  And how do you approach that constituency as you look to run for a wider office? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=345.48s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Michigan very much is a microcosm of the country with the rural voters, urban [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=349.92s)]
*  voters, demographics across the state. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=355.2s)]
*  And what I've seen is I have served the people of Michigan for the last several years and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=358.52s)]
*  run one of these agencies that does interact with everyone, is that people are struggling. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=361.92s)]
*  People are struggling to pay for child care, to buy a home in the community they want to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=366.08s)]
*  live in. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  The cost of everything continues to escalate. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=371.47999999999996s)]
*  Many voters voted for Trump, expecting him to drive those costs down. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=374.56s)]
*  That's not happening. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=377.88s)]
*  The opposite is happening as a result of these reckless tariffs and other economic policies. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=378.88s)]
*  Farmers are worried about where they're going to sell their inventory. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=383.88s)]
*  Small business owners are worried about whether they're going to get any inventory with these [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=390.76s)]
*  So in this moment, we need executive officials, governors, who's going to stand up and fight [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=391.76s)]
*  for the economic prosperity of our state. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=395.48s)]
*  And that actually can bring people together, because whether you're a Democrat or Republican [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=397.8s)]
*  Independent, you want government to work well, then you want it to save you time and save [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=401.36s)]
*  you money and make your life easier. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=405.5s)]
*  So I'm running for governor with that message. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=407.24s)]
*  And I believe that's a winning message in 2026 for any Democrat who wants to win a state [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=408.88s)]
*  like ours. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=413.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=414.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=415.36s)]
*  Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=416.36s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=417.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjksFvOJzUI&t=425.44s)]
