Video Description: When the animals on Manor Farm overthrow the farmer who lords over them, they dream of a utopia built on an inclusive mission: all animals are equal. But power is corrupting, and soon an autocratic pig seizes control and imposes a new creed on the farm: All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others. That is the premise of today’s Velshi Banned Book Club feature, one of the most salient political satires ever written: “Animal Farm” by George Orwell. Orwell’s masterful command of language, his dynamic and complex anthropomorphic characters, and well-paced plot are precision instruments used to sharply warn its reader of the corrupting influence of power, the danger of blind obedience, and the cyclical nature of politics. As Téa Obreht, author of the foreword for the 75th anniversary edition of “Animal Farm”, says, “The book is a warning in the clearest possible way, through animal fable, that [authoritarianism] can happen everywhere.”

# Velshi Banned Book Club: ‘Animal Farm’ by George Orwell
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs)
*  I have a story for you. It's a fable, one you might have heard before. It takes place [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=0.0s)]
*  on a farm in the middle of the English countryside. The animals on the farm have come up with [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=7.0s)]
*  a plan. They're tired of pulling such heavy machines to plow such big fields. They're [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  tired of losing their offspring, their puppies, their foals, their calves to greedy farmers [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=15.72s)]
*  or to the slaughterhouse. They're tired of hunger, of painful harnesses, of forced sterilization, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=20.88s)]
*  of beatings. They're tired of having no say in their own existence, so they plan to overthrow [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=27.0s)]
*  the farmer who lords over them. The farm animals are big and strong, so it happens quickly, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=32.56s)]
*  more quickly than any of the animals anticipate. Soon the pigs ascend as decision makers on [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=37.56s)]
*  the farms. It makes sense, mostly because the pigs are the smartest, after all. For [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=42.32s)]
*  a little while, this new life works. The animals work together. They live under a creed of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=46.84s)]
*  equality and freedom. Soon, though, two pigs named Napoleon and Snowball emerge as competing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=50.92s)]
*  leaders. They just can't agree. Snowball is more ideological and passionate. Napoleon [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=58.64s)]
*  is more conniving, more brutal. One day Napoleon forces Snowball off the farm with attack dogs [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=63.0s)]
*  that he's brainwashed since birth. After that, things change. The farm begins to operate [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=68.68s)]
*  under a new, unyielding dogma. All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=73.26s)]
*  than others. That's the premise of today's Velsheban Book Club feature, one of the most [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=79.12s)]
*  salient political satires ever written, a true cultural touchstone, Animal Farm by George [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=83.16000000000001s)]
*  Orwell. The genius of Orwell's Animal Farm is the depth of the storytelling. At face [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=89.2s)]
*  value, Animal Farm is a beautifully written barnyard fable. A little deeper, an animal [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=93.92s)]
*  farm is an allegory, satire. What Animal Farm set out to illustrate is well known and well [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  documented. Orwell's disdain for Joseph Stalin and his reproach of totalitarianism and England's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=105.44s)]
*  wartime allegiance with Russia. Orwell, a dedicated democratic socialist, was a notorious [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=112.2s)]
*  critic of not just Stalin, but of all government overreach. In a 1946 essay entitled Why I [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=117.24s)]
*  Write, George Orwell explained, quote, Animal Farm was the first book in which I tried with [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=124.4s)]
*  full consciousness of what I was doing, to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=129.14s)]
*  into one whole. Deeper still is the warning Animal Farm imparts for today's reader. You [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=134.92s)]
*  don't need to be fully aware of Stalin's brutalities to understand precisely what Animal [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  Farm is telling you. Orwell's masterful command of language, his dynamic and complex anthropomorphic [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=146.56s)]
*  characters, and his well-placed plot are precision instruments that are used to warn the reader [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=152.67999999999998s)]
*  of the corrupting influence of power, of the danger of blind obedience, and the cyclical [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  nature of politics. And that's what's most stirring in this novel. Political context [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=163.32s)]
*  that would have been obvious when the novella was initially published in 1945 is superfluous [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=168.76s)]
*  in some ways to the story itself. The reader doesn't need to fully grasp the violent struggle [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=173.68s)]
*  for dominance between Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin in Russia to react to the unjust death [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=179.32s)]
*  of animals and their struggle for equality and freedom. You don't need to know any of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=184.44s)]
*  that, to know that there are many things in this book that ring true in today's America. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=188.92s)]
*  I don't usually spoil the ending of the work we cover on Velshi Van Book Club, but today [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=194.28s)]
*  I'm going to. Napoleon, after killing his most loyal worker and betraying his former [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=198.92s)]
*  friends, joins forces with the humans, the farmers, the very people that subjugated Napoleon [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=203.92s)]
*  and the farm animals for so long. Napoleon and the farmers sit around a table and drink [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=210.16s)]
*  and eat and celebrate a prosperous future for their farms. The other animals watch from [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=214.72s)]
*  outside the window. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=219.6s)]
*  The creatures outside looked from pig to man and from man to pig and from pig to man [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=244.72s)]
*  again but already it was impossible to say which was which. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=249.76s)]
*  At the end of Orwell's Animal Farm, the government wins. The totalitarian government wins. After [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=255.48s)]
*  a short commercial break, I'm joined by Taya Obrack, the award-winning author, an animal [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=261.12s)]
*  farm expert, and the writer of the forward for Animal Farm's Anniversary Edition. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=265.68s)]
*  Alright, today's meeting in the Velshi Van Book Club is officially underway. We're covering [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=271.28s)]
*  an enduring classic, a work of fiction that is as critical today as it was when it was [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  first written 80 years ago. Animal Farm by George Orwell. Here with me is Taya Obrack. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=279.64s)]
*  Taya is an animal farm expert, really. She wrote the forward for the 75th Anniversary [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  Edition. She teaches Animal Farm to high school students across the country. She's also the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=290.11999999999995s)]
*  award-winning author of numerous books, including The Morning Side. Taya, welcome to the Velshi [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=294.26s)]
*  Van Book Club. Thanks so much for having me. I'm thrilled to be here. This is this [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=298.88s)]
*  book we were trying to, you know, convey the idea that doesn't matter if you don't know [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=304.1s)]
*  the background. It doesn't even matter if you're not living in America at this moment. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=308.6s)]
*  Everybody who read Animal Farm generally got it the first time around. Why does this conceit [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=313.52s)]
*  work so well? Why do the animals work so well in this allegory? Well, the animals themselves [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=318.88s)]
*  because it is a beast fable, right? And that's sort of how most children, at least in the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=325.44s)]
*  West, are first introduced to narrative and introduced to narrative with a moral center. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=331.44s)]
*  As you said in the introduction, Orwell was very, very explicit about his purpose in writing [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=339.12s)]
*  this book. He wanted it to be incredibly clear. He wanted to highlight the aspects of society [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=345.72s)]
*  that allow authoritarianism to thrive. Our fascination with strongmen, the weaponization [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=351.14s)]
*  of language, the revision of history, how silence makes us complicit in our own downfall. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=356.82s)]
*  And one of the reasons that he wanted to do this was because he felt that his countrymen [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=362.74s)]
*  did not think that Stalin's brand of authoritarianism was something that could happen in the UK. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  Maybe it could happen in Russia, but it could never happen in the West. And the book is [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=371.64s)]
*  a warning, and it's a very clear warning in the simplest possible terms through animal [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=376.14s)]
*  fable. It can happen anywhere. Here's how. You know, one of the things that we we talk [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=380.38s)]
*  about a lot these days, even in today's specific news about a squabble that's been going on [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=385.4s)]
*  in the last week between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, goes back to one of the most famous [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=390.54s)]
*  quotes in Animal Farm, probably the most famous quote of Animal Farm. All animals are equal, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=395.4s)]
*  but some animals are more equal than others. A truism through time. Absolutely. And that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=399.98s)]
*  quote, I mean, I think people know it even when they haven't read the book, and it shows [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=409.1s)]
*  the radical corruption of the original tenet, right? The original language, which is part [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=414.06s)]
*  of the seven tenets of animalism that are established for the animals rebel against [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=419.7s)]
*  Farmer Jones, is all animals are equal. And so this revised stance, like so much of what [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=425.82s)]
*  the boar Napoleon does, is a kind of sleight of hand. He's saying what he means. He's saying [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=432.14s)]
*  exactly what he means, that some animals, not only the pigs, will be privileged over [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=436.74s)]
*  others, but he's saying it using the language of the original tenet, using the language [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=441.09999999999997s)]
*  of freedom. And he's casting a kind of spell over Animal Farm in which the true history [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=447.78s)]
*  and the true purpose of the rebellion is being slowly erased. Is this different right now [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=452.9s)]
*  than you would have taught this five years ago or 10 years ago or 15 years ago? Does [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=459.09999999999997s)]
*  the relevance of the story move and evolve as our politics do? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=464.62s)]
*  I don't think I mean, I think the scary thing about it, the jarring thing about it is how [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=472.66s)]
*  relevant it remains in the exact same way. You know, it's a it's a blueprint. It's a [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=477.14s)]
*  map of how those in power accrue more power and how everyday people fall into the spell [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=484.42s)]
*  of strong men and how good intentions and difficult times can be manipulated to clamp [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=488.98s)]
*  down on an entire society. And it's a blueprint for a reason. You know, I'm sure that Orwell, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=492.98s)]
*  when he wrote this, didn't hope, hoped that its existence would eliminate the need for it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=501.3s)]
*  You know, and we're not there at all. We have this book. And yet here we are. You know, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=508.26s)]
*  we're still banning books. We're still talking about sanctioned and sanitized history. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=515.3000000000001s)]
*  We still claim that we stand for the values of equality while our society makes it abundantly [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=520.4200000000001s)]
*  clear every day at home and abroad that some animals are more equal than others. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=525.3000000000001s)]
*  Early in the in the planning of the rebellion in the book, one of the animals, Molly, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=531.14s)]
*  was a white mare, asks what will become of her. The very first question she asked Snowball was, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=535.0600000000001s)]
*  will there still be sugar after the rebellion? No, said Snowball firmly. We have no means of [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=539.7800000000001s)]
*  making sugar on this farm. Besides, you do not need sugar. You will have all the oats and hay [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=544.5s)]
*  you want. And shall I still be allowed to wear ribbons in my mane? Asked Molly. Comrade, said [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=548.98s)]
*  Snowball, those ribbons that you are so devoted to are the badge of slavery. Can you not understand [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=554.58s)]
*  that liberty is worth more than ribbons? Molly agreed, but she did not sound very convinced. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=559.46s)]
*  Talk to me about that and how it applies to the modern day. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=565.86s)]
*  Well, Molly, after that exchange, you know, Molly doesn't last long on the new farm. She [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=571.14s)]
*  chooses to run away because she misses her sugar cubes and she misses her fancy ribbons. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=576.5s)]
*  And through her, Orwell has the opportunity to comment on how creature comforts can come to mean [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=582.74s)]
*  more to us than our freedom or our morality or our allegiance to our community. But he's also [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=588.02s)]
*  commenting on the fact that in every society there are strata, right? And even in oppressive regimes, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=594.58s)]
*  not everyone is equally oppressed. And that applies very much to the modern day. Even in an [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=601.38s)]
*  oppressive regime, some people get sugar cubes and some people get ribbons. You know, Molly, I feel, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=606.74s)]
*  is the epitome of the we could all be at brunch point of view. Is there, when you teach this, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=611.54s)]
*  is there an impetus for students to read this to associate it with their time? Because what [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=617.62s)]
*  you're talking about is the fact that it's sort of timeless. It's been relevant at every point [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=623.38s)]
*  in history since it was written. Absolutely. And I think we talk very explicitly about that. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=626.74s)]
*  You know, I live in the Mountain West and I talk to students in the Mountain West and these tend to [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=632.9s)]
*  be rural schools where, you know, the book is taught to young people, usually to teenagers. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=637.78s)]
*  It's usually taught in high school. And students will often ask, you know, I'm 15 years old and I [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=646.5799999999999s)]
*  live in Wyoming or I live in Idaho. How is this relevant to me? Like, what can I, even if I [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=652.02s)]
*  have metabolized the information, what can I do with it? Even if it's timeless, what can I do with [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=658.8199999999999s)]
*  it? And I think the answer with this book and with all books really is allow it to ask the questions [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgMdCyGhXs&t=663.54s)]
