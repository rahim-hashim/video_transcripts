Video Description: NBC News Chief Washington Correspondent Andrea Mitchell reacts to the news of former President Joe Biden's "aggressive" prostate cancer diagnosis. "When you have a presidential work-up, as all presidents do, it's mystifying as how it was not caught sooner, when it could have been diagnosed before it metastasized to his bones," says Mitchell. "It's just common sense, especially if you know something about prostate cancer, [which] is very treatable when found early."

# Andrea Mitchell: It's 'mystifying' that Biden's cancer wasn't caught earlier
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M)
*  Let's bring into the conversation right now NBC News Chief Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=0.0s)]
*  correspondent Andrea Mitchell. Andrea it's great to have you with us sadly [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=4.0s)]
*  though for this breaking news unfortunately. Tell us a little bit about [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=8.52s)]
*  what you're thinking tonight. What have you been hearing from folks that you've [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=11.8s)]
*  been speaking to as this news of the president's diagnosis sets in? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=14.88s)]
*  Well of course everyone is very concerned. Fortunately it's treatable but for him to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=20.32s)]
*  have this kind of a setback it's just it's terribly sad and for the family to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=27.68s)]
*  be going through this. I would just say that I have talked to people who were in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=32.6s)]
*  the White House and close to the former president and it is something that is [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=39.04s)]
*  very easily diagnosed at the early stage. You know clearly that this is something [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=44.16s)]
*  that can be diagnosed with an early biopsy with a TSA with you know elevated [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=49.6s)]
*  rather PSA levels. So I know something about this kind of disease and I just [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=54.28s)]
*  know that this can be treated. It's hormone susceptible so that is great. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=61.36s)]
*  It would probably be radiation and anti hormone anti-testosterone treatments [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=66.36s)]
*  which can be done. Just it's so sad that he's going through this and frankly when [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=73.44s)]
*  you have a presidential workup as all presidents do it's mystifying as how it [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=79.96s)]
*  was not caught sooner and when it could have been diagnosed before he [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=85.8s)]
*  metastasized to his bones and that's what some people are indeed saying. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  This is non-doctors and not involved in the case obviously but it's just [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=95.44s)]
*  common sense especially if you know something about prostate cancer that is [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=101.32s)]
*  very treatable when it is found early and you know either operable I mean you [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  know we know people like John Kerry in the middle of his presidential campaign [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=113.28s)]
*  had prostate surgery in Baltimore Johns Hopkins. I was covering him at the time [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  and you know has had a hugely active life as Secretary of State and post [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=121.92s)]
*  Secretary of State ever since. I mean so every case is different but it's just [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=129.2s)]
*  terribly sad that this was not caught earlier and you know one really wonders [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=133.76s)]
*  about the medical care he was receiving while in the White House. And Andrea this [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=139.72s)]
*  is an incredibly tight-knit family. Can you take us into what you imagine or [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=144.64s)]
*  what you might have heard they may be doing this weekend how they're offering [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  the president's support the conversations that might be happening in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=154.0s)]
*  his inner circle? First of all this is a very tough time you know this is a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=157.84s)]
*  subject we were talking about about the president the former president just this [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=163.96s)]
*  morning on Meet the Press because of all of the reporting and the new book and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=168.4s)]
*  you know a lot of second-guessing about whether he should have run for another [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=174.76s)]
*  term whether he should have gotten out sooner. So all of that political score was [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=179.8s)]
*  going around them and it's very unpleasant and the fact that he lost [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=184.4s)]
*  his son Bo in 2015 to cancer the her tapes the audio tapes were just [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=190.52s)]
*  released it's just a pile up and it's it's very sad knowing how much tragedy [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  that he is into where I've covered Joe Biden since he his first days in the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=204.88s)]
*  Senate as a local reporter here in Pennsylvania where I am actually tonight [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=209.08s)]
*  and the fact that you know I've seen him go through so many of these tragedies [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=214.8s)]
*  when he was first elected and deciding whether he would even you know complete [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  his term because he had two little boys that was taken care of at home he lost [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=226.12s)]
*  his wife and lost his child his little girl so when you think about all that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  that he has endured and the criticism that he's had recently you know negative [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=235.48s)]
*  reporting it's just a terrible time for this family and just very sorry that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=241.84s)]
*  he's going through this I'm just happy to know from experience that I've known [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_6Vo0Kz5M&t=248.0s)]
