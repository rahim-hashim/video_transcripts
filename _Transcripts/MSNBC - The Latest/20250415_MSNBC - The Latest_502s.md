# China tries to capitalize on Trump tariff turmoil
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs)
*  And we're going to bring in Courtney Brown, economics reporter for Axios, and Jonathan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=0.0s)]
*  Hillman, a senior fellow for geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=4.04s)]
*  Jonathan, I want to start with you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  We just heard Steve talk about the ripple effects this is having on everybody from the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=9.14s)]
*  guy who's running the port to the lady who runs the coffee shop. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  We're now hearing the president float the idea of putting new tariffs potentially on [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=16.98s)]
*  things like computer chips and pharmaceutical drugs. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=20.76s)]
*  What is that going to mean for consumers? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=23.72s)]
*  So we saw over the weekend a little bit of relief and some exclusions for some very high [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=25.6s)]
*  tariffs that were placed on Chinese products, especially for smartphones and a range of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=31.04s)]
*  other electronics. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=35.56s)]
*  I think that was done because the pain would have been quite severe if those were left [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=36.96s)]
*  on. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=41.64s)]
*  However, though, U.S. officials have assured us that don't worry, there are more tariffs [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=42.64s)]
*  coming. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  And so they've announced just yesterday that they'll be beginning a national security [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  investigation into semiconductors as well as pharmaceuticals. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=52.6s)]
*  So the timetable on that is a little bit uncertain, but we can expect tariffs to come in both [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=57.04s)]
*  areas. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=61.2s)]
*  Courtney, those seem like two very different products for a couple of reasons to me, and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=62.2s)]
*  you can tell me if I'm an idiot, which I might be. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=65.04s)]
*  But with things like laptops and electronics and chips, folks can wait on that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=67.52s)]
*  They don't have to buy it if they can't afford it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  But for things with pharmaceuticals, is it realistic if there's a production gap to expect [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  Americans who need a drug that's coming from overseas to not be able to get it for a long [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=79.8s)]
*  period of time or get it at an exorbitant price? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=84.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=86.8s)]
*  Exactly how you say there are some things that can be deferred. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=87.8s)]
*  There are some things that are more discretionary than other goods. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=90.84s)]
*  Drugs, not one of them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=94.4s)]
*  I think this speaks to the key issue at the heart of President Trump's tariff strategy, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=96.84s)]
*  which is just you cannot choke off global supply of something so crucial like pharmaceuticals [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  when there is no domestic manufacturing supplier to kind of replace what you're cutting off, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  because that is in fact what tariffs do. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=118.96s)]
*  He is seeking to use tariffs as a stick of sorts to convince manufacturers to produce [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=121.8s)]
*  more here in the U.S. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=129.64s)]
*  But those two things can't happen at the same time. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=131.67999999999998s)]
*  It takes so much time to build a facility and get workers and power it up. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=134.88s)]
*  So there is going to be this gap. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=140.42s)]
*  And I think it's a little worrisome to think about how that might affect the pharmaceutical [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=143.83999999999997s)]
*  industry. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  Jonathan, I also want to ask you, because it is tax day, President Trump is now saying [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  money from tariffs could potentially replace income taxes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=153.88s)]
*  I want you to listen to the sound we've got. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  There is a chance that the money from tariffs could be so great that it would replace, you [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=160.12s)]
*  know, in the old days, 18, about 1870 to 1913, the tariffs were the only form of money. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  And that's when our nation was relatively the richest. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=174.24s)]
*  We were the richest. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=177.56s)]
*  Can you fact check that for us? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=180.84s)]
*  Is the president right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=182.52s)]
*  Could we see so much revenue from tariffs that income tax could be a thing of the past? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=183.70000000000002s)]
*  One of the things that often gets left out when these numbers are tossed around is that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  as the tariffs rise, the amount of trade declines. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=192.2s)]
*  And so this is not a one for one where we're going to just, it's a little bit different [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=196.32s)]
*  than the IRS. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  So they're potentially looking at that formula based on the current level of U.S. trade, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  which the whole goal of this is to lessen that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=204.16s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=206.64s)]
*  And so I'm not holding my breath for this to be a real boon for government spending. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=207.64s)]
*  And I'm also frankly not hoping to go back to 1870, you know, when the U.S. was primarily [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=211.94s)]
*  an agrarian country, you know, and most homes didn't have electricity. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=218.1s)]
*  Courtney, I have more stupid questions for you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=223.9s)]
*  One of the things that I've been wondering and should probably know the answer to, but [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=226.98s)]
*  don't, is when these tariffs are collected, where does that money go? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=229.78s)]
*  What agency actually gets it? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=233.92s)]
*  Who's holding it? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=235.62s)]
*  How soon do you think we're going to see tariffs start to come in? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=236.98s)]
*  Is it immediately? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=239.86s)]
*  Are they already coming in and how soon does it take to kind of ramp up to make sure all [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=240.98000000000002s)]
*  goods like if it's on the water today, is it getting hit with that tariff? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=244.94000000000003s)]
*  If it was on the water last week, is it? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  Can you kind of walk us through where the money goes? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  I think this is the biggest untold story of what's happening with tariffs right now. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=252.26000000000002s)]
*  A story that I'm working on, by the way. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=258.46000000000004s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=261.5s)]
*  We'll give us a little preview. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=262.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=263.5s)]
*  Opportunity to plug it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=264.5s)]
*  Customs and border protection is known for its role with immigration. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=266.5s)]
*  But there's also a huge part of that agency that collects tariffs. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=272.06s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=276.38s)]
*  How quickly this trade policy is moving. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=277.62s)]
*  There are workers at CBP trying to put the infrastructure in place to collect these tariffs. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=281.38s)]
*  You might remember, it seems like years ago, but it was actually just a few months ago, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=287.64s)]
*  the Trump administration announced an intention to collect tariffs on goods worth $800 or [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=293.14s)]
*  less. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=300.53999999999996s)]
*  So whatever you're bringing in from Temu or Xi'an, those goods were going to get tariffs. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=301.53999999999996s)]
*  And then they had to come back and say, just kidding, can't do that yet. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=306.9s)]
*  We don't exactly have the infrastructure in place to collect the revenue. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=311.53999999999996s)]
*  It seems like they're going to try again to kind of strike what's called the de minimis [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=316.02s)]
*  exemption and put those tariffs in place. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  But it's taken so much time for CBP to build the capacity to collect those tariffs. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=324.3s)]
*  So there's kind of like this shadow system of trying to get the money that President [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=331.62s)]
*  Trump says is going to fill government coffers. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=338.76000000000005s)]
*  We don't necessarily have all the things in place to do that yet. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=341.14000000000004s)]
*  And CBP has got a lot on its plate right now. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=346.32000000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=348.5s)]
*  I also want to ask you, China's president is on a bit of a charm offensive across Southeast [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=349.54s)]
*  Asia. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=353.94s)]
*  He urged Vietnam to, quote, oppose unilateral bullying and uphold free trade. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=354.94s)]
*  The last two administrations, both Democrat and Republican, have been trying to forge [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=361.02s)]
*  closer ties, both militarily and economically, with Vietnam. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=364.46s)]
*  Do you think Xi is seeing an opportunity here across Asia to maybe bring these folks who [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=367.86s)]
*  had been looking more towards the West back into China's fold? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=372.12s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=375.38s)]
*  So Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been not sitting at home waiting for President Trump [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=376.54s)]
*  to call him. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=381.02s)]
*  He is out there, as you said, on a charm offensive in Vietnam, in Malaysia, and in Cambodia this [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=382.02s)]
*  week. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=387.98s)]
*  And so they're talking about opposing bullying and upholding the multilateral trade system. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=388.98s)]
*  But they're doing more than talking, too. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=394.34s)]
*  They've signed agreements to deepen cooperation on supply chains. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=396.1s)]
*  They're pursuing a joint railroad project with Vietnam. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=399.42s)]
*  And then they're going to look at deepening an agreement that they have with about 10 [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=402.74s)]
*  Southeast Asian countries. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=407.1s)]
*  And so U.S. tariffs here are effectively rolling out the red carpet for Xi Jinping when he [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=409.06s)]
*  goes into these foreign markets. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=413.74s)]
*  Courtney, I also want to ask you about the other word we seem to talk about previously [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=416.02s)]
*  all the time, which is inflation. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=420.02s)]
*  You've looked at Fed data about consumer concerns as the tariffs take hold. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=422.14s)]
*  Is there a general worry what this all could do to the already high inflation rate in this [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=427.3s)]
*  country? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=431.26s)]
*  In the short term, yes. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=432.78s)]
*  Consumers are expecting a pretty significant jump in inflation. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=433.78s)]
*  We saw that in the New York Times. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=437.26s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=438.26s)]
*  Well, they're expecting that companies are going to pass along the extra costs they get [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=439.26s)]
*  from tariffs. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=444.46s)]
*  They're going to pass along right to the shelves of the things that they buy. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=445.46s)]
*  Companies have a lot of experience doing that from this inflation shock that we just got [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=449.92s)]
*  through. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=453.98s)]

*  to go up. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=468.3s)]

*  Deja vu all over again. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=475.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=476.86s)]
*  Jonathan Hillman, Courtney Brown, thank you both so much. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=477.86s)]
*  I think I'm a little smarter now. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=479.76s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFHkG4plUs&t=480.98s)]
