# Trump leads Memorial Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI)
*  Let's get this hour started with NBC News senior White House correspondent Kelly O'Donnell [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=0.0s)]
*  and Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Jack Jacobs. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=4.24s)]
*  Kelly, first to you, what do you expect from today's ceremony from the president as we [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=7.04s)]
*  expect to see him there any moment now? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=12.64s)]
*  Well, it is a solemn day. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  And you noted that sort of split in American life where for many people it's a day of rest [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=17.2s)]
*  and family time and barbecues, but it has the far deeper meaning in honoring those who [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=23.02s)]
*  gave their lives in service of the country. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  And so the president's appearance is part of the tradition, a long tradition. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=30.84s)]
*  There are many military families that will be in attendance, members of the military [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=35.2s)]
*  community and those who have felt that loss very personally. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=39.32s)]
*  So it is one of the more, I think, deeply held traditions of the presidency where as [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  commander in chief, he's able to go there and pay his respects. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=49.96s)]
*  Of course, it typically includes the laying of a wreath at the tomb of the unknowns, also [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=53.86s)]
*  giving remarks. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=59.46s)]
*  And the president has this morning already posted about his planned remarks today. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=60.46s)]
*  What will, I think, be interesting to look for is how much does he hew to the notion [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=65.82s)]
*  of honoring that service and sacrifice and how much does he talk about current events [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=70.78s)]
*  or some of his views about the modern military and how he is trying to change it through [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=75.9s)]
*  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who has taken some very bold steps in changing who [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=81.74s)]
*  can serve and where the focus is. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  So we expect it to be that mix of tradition, of honoring the long standing moment where [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=91.02s)]
*  the country pauses to honor those who gave their lives and in the Trump era, being braced [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=97.06s)]
*  for the unpredictable as well. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=102.3s)]
*  Yeah, the unpredictable, Kelly, informed by the fact that the president's tone on social [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  media today stood in stark contrast to the more somber tones typically associated with [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  this Memorial Day. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=114.7s)]
*  The president lashing out at the former administration and other critics of his. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=116.14s)]
*  Does that inform any way that we're thinking he could arrive to these ceremonies? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=120.94s)]
*  Well, he has certainly been critical of the former administration, especially with respect [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=124.78s)]
*  to things like the exit from Afghanistan, something he said in motion in his first term, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=129.62s)]
*  where he is very critical about how that was executed back in 2021. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=135.29999999999998s)]
*  So it's possible he'll make references to that as well. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=139.82s)]
*  And certainly it is the president breaking the tradition of sort of giving some space [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=143.17999999999998s)]
*  to past presidents. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=148.94s)]
*  He has never really seen himself in the former president's club when he was out of office [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=149.94s)]
*  for that time. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=155.34s)]
*  And he likes to sort of attach himself to all of the changes very personally. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=156.7s)]
*  Of course, he did not serve in the military. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=162.06s)]
*  His critics will point out that he had deferments when he was of age to serve. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=163.98s)]
*  So it has always been a bit of a mix. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=168.54s)]
*  He's also been criticized for how he has privately spoken about those who have served comments [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=170.62s)]
*  that he has often disputed. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=177.1s)]
*  But they came from his former chief of staff in the first term and a four star Marine general [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=179.78s)]
*  and gold star father in talking about some denigrating comments about questioning why [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=185.1s)]
*  people would give their lives to the service of the military. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=190.34s)]
*  Very starkly different than the tone we would expect today. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=194.5s)]
*  So his relationship to the military has always had those complexities. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=197.70000000000002s)]
*  Ali? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=202.34s)]
*  Yeah, a long history that you detail for us there, Kelly. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=202.82s)]
*  So Colonel Jack, against that backdrop, how are you thinking about this Memorial Day? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=206.5s)]
*  Well, I get asked from time to time what it was on Memorial Day. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=212.9s)]
*  I got to tell you that I think about the same thing I think about every day. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=217.3s)]
*  I served with a fairly substantial number of comrades who were killed in action [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=221.62s)]
*  and whose memory I resurrect as often as I possibly can. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=230.74s)]
*  Brave soldiers and sailors and airmen and Marines who never came home, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=236.5s)]
*  whose lives were cut short by their service and by their sacrifice. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  And it's important that same feeling that I have, which by the way is shared by almost all veterans [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=246.9s)]
*  who fought in all the wars, that those who did not serve remember the sacrifice that gave them the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=256.1s)]
*  freedom that they enjoy today. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=265.86s)]
*  To the extent that we forget about that, we are not keeping faith with those who did their utmost [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=267.86s)]
*  to us to ensure that we enjoy freedom today. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=276.97999999999996s)]
*  I'm reminded often of an observation by John Stuart Mill, the British philosopher who once wrote [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  something like, war is a terrible thing, but it's not the worst of things. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=293.29999999999995s)]
*  A man for whom nothing is more important than his own safety is a miserable creature [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=300.58s)]
*  who was made free and kept free by the exertions of better men than he. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  We who fought in the crucible of war and who survived it, think about that on the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=314.73999999999995s)]
*  time, but it would be worthwhile if those who did not serve thought about that, not just today, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=320.34s)]
*  but every day. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=330.18s)]
*  Ali. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=332.18s)]
*  An absolutely important and worthwhile reminder there, Colonel Jack Jacobs, as we continue to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=334.18s)]
*  look here at the tomb of the unknown at Arlington National Cemetery. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=338.5s)]
*  Again, we expect to see President Trump potentially there laying his last rites of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=342.34s)]
*  the day. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=347.21999999999997s)]
*  And then giving remarks at that shot of the amphitheater that we continually show you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=349.21999999999997s)]
*  Both of these are live pictures. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=355.38s)]
*  We are keeping a close eye on them. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=357.29999999999995s)]
*  But Kelly, there were also those who might not have been glued to the television this weekend [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=359.14s)]
*  where they would have missed a Trump sort of magified speech at West Point to graduates. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=363.94s)]
*  What happened there? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=370.5s)]
*  There were a lot of mentions that I think might not fit the usual fare of a commencement [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=371.62s)]
*  speech to cadets there. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=376.5s)]
*  Oh, and how many times have we used that kind of phrase to talk about things in this era? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=378.9s)]
*  But typically, the president and vice president rotate through commencement addresses for the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=383.3s)]
*  military academies, and President Trump delivered the address to the West Point cadets this weekend. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=387.7s)]
*  And in so many ways, he brings that campaign ethos into this role. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=395.22s)]
*  And typically, presidents would not do that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=401.78s)]
*  You'd be in commander-in-chief mode. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=404.42s)]
*  Wearing of the red MAGA hat, that's campaign gear. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=406.34s)]
*  And typically, that would not be the case. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=409.85999999999996s)]
*  You would be more focused on the office. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=412.02s)]
*  But for President Trump, he's really merged those things. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=414.58s)]
*  A campaign gear is all over the White House. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=417.46s)]
*  And again, typically, that would be put aside for the time after a campaign. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=420.09999999999997s)]
*  And there are some rules for federal employees on that, but they don't apply to the president [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=424.73999999999995s)]
*  himself. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=429.14s)]
*  So he's able to do it, and he does it frequently. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=429.53999999999996s)]
*  He also uses those addresses to kind of veer into the familiar of how he likes to speak [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=432.18s)]
*  in campaign-style moments, where he talks about a wide variety of topics that may not have [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=441.94s)]
*  anything to do with the specific event. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=448.02s)]
*  Of course, commencement address is to give encouragement and support for a new class of [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=450.58s)]
*  officers going out to serve the country. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=456.5s)]
*  There were some of those notes. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=458.9s)]
*  But the president also talked about trophy wives and how that typically doesn't work [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=460.66s)]
*  out. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=466.34000000000003s)]
*  Very dissonant from what you would expect to hear. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=466.58000000000004s)]
*  Here's part of what the president had to say in talking about the job of the military. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=469.70000000000005s)]
*  The job of the U.S. Armed Forces is not to host drag shows to transform foreign cultures, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=475.54s)]
*  to spread democracy to everybody around the world at the point of a gun. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=484.90000000000003s)]
*  The military's job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America anywhere, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=491.22s)]
*  anytime, and any place. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=497.94s)]
*  And so some of that, you get a sense of the culture wars coming into the speech, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=502.34000000000003s)]
*  obviously talking about the role of the military as he sees it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=506.42s)]
*  And certainly talking about democracy is important with respect to the duty that these [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=510.65999999999997s)]
*  service members, in this case, the Army officers will face. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=516.8199999999999s)]
*  But it's also very political. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=521.38s)]
*  And often as commander in chief, there are restrictions on politics for service members, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=523.14s)]
*  and he sometimes blurs those lines. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=528.9s)]
*  Yeah, certainly those lines blurred over the weekend. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=532.02s)]
*  Colonel Jack Trump was talking there about the transformations and the shifts that he [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=534.74s)]
*  has made within this military. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=538.98s)]
*  It's everything from restrictions on the Pentagon press corps to banning [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=540.58s)]
*  trans-military members. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=544.1800000000001s)]
*  What do you make of the transformations that this administration, from the president to [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=546.1s)]
*  the defense secretary, have made of these armed forces? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=550.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, there's always good news and bad news with almost everything. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=554.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=558.34s)]
*  There's no doubt about the fact that the focus of the military establishment should [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=558.84s)]
*  be on defending the republic. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=564.5s)]
*  There are lots of arguments about how that should be done, but suffice it to say that [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=568.1800000000001s)]
*  troops being able to conduct and win wars is the most important thing that we do, and to [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=574.74s)]
*  deter any potential aggressor. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=584.34s)]
*  To the extent that we spend the limited amount of training time [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=588.6600000000001s)]
*  on things that do not achieve those objectives, we're probably making a mistake. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=593.78s)]
*  But you're also looking at somebody in me who believes that everybody who's lucky enough to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=600.74s)]
*  live in a free country owes it something in the form of service, and that means everybody. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=605.9399999999999s)]
*  We don't have the political will to ensure that that's the case. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=612.3399999999999s)]
*  We decided about 50 years or so ago that we weren't going to have an all-volunteer force, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=615.94s)]
*  which in theory sounds like a great idea, but it excludes the large majority of people who [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=622.82s)]
*  ought to be serving. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=628.82s)]
*  The fact is that most Americans do not know anybody in uniform, and that's a very dangerous [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=630.74s)]
*  situation because it results in a wide gap that opens up between those who are serving [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=637.14s)]
*  and those who are being served. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=642.26s)]
*  But to the extent that we do have the volunteer force that we have, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=644.98s)]
*  we need to focus our attention on the most important tasks, and that is to become A [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=649.06s)]
*  and to be and to continue to be a lethal force that both deters and defeats enemies. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=655.86s)]
*  Unfortunately, as Kelly says, politics always has to be a lethal force. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=665.06s)]
*  Kelly says politics always drifts into almost everything that Donald Trump says and does, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=670.18s)]
*  and we need to be able to parse all that to separate those things that do make a great deal [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=678.9799999999999s)]
*  of sense and that do contribute to the proper defense of the republic and those things that are [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=685.8599999999999s)]
*  just politics and in many cases just rubbish. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=693.62s)]
*  We need to be able to separate those two. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=700.7399999999999s)]
*  If we do not, then we're making a big mistake, but I think most people are capable of doing that, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=703.06s)]
*  Ali. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYapc78UktI&t=707.2199999999999s)]
