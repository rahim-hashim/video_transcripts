# 'Art of the deal' or 'real business threats'?: Trump tariffs continue to cause uncertainty
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U)
*  Joining us, NBC News White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor, Axios Senior Economics reporter [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=0.0s)]
*  Courtney Brown, and Bloomberg White House correspondent Akaila Gardner. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=6.28s)]
*  All right, Yamiche, what prompted the reversal, or not the reversal, this latest delay? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=10.88s)]
*  Well, it's a good question. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=17.56s)]
*  We know that the president is saying that he took a call from the head of the European [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=19.92s)]
*  Commission and that she wanted to make a deal with him, and that convinced him that he didn't [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=23.2s)]
*  want to put in this 50 percent tariff that was supposed to be put in place on June 1. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=27.92s)]
*  And instead, he said he's going to delay it until July 9. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=33.6s)]
*  Of course, we should underline and underscore that that was the original 90-day pause after [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=35.6s)]
*  he had rolled out those Liberation Day tariffs and then said that he was going to pause that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=40.6s)]
*  So it's not that this is a new date. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=45.660000000000004s)]
*  This is just essentially him sort of going back to the other date. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  That being said, the president, he initially said that it's because negotiations were going [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=49.86s)]
*  nowhere and that he felt like Europe was taking advantage of the United States. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=53.14s)]
*  It's not clear exactly what has changed, other than the fact that he got a phone call saying, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  hey, can we work this out? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=60.76s)]
*  It's also interesting that, while he said that he's gotten trade deals with the U.K. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  as well as China, those are still frameworks and they're still working out the details. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=66.2s)]
*  So in fact, right now, after Liberation Day happening more than a month and a half ago, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=70.6s)]
*  we don't actually have any deals and have any real foresight into what the United States [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=75.08s)]
*  actually wants out of these trade deals. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=79.2s)]
*  Katie? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=80.92s)]
*  You are so right about that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=81.92s)]
*  There's actually zero deals because the U.K., not the United Nations, my bad. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=83.76s)]
*  That deal was just a framework, but it's a little bit farther down the line in the figuring [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=87.8s)]
*  out of what it's going to be than even the China deal was, which was just a framework [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=91.86s)]
*  to continue the negotiations. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=96.06s)]
*  But still, as you said, no real actual deal, still nothing for the 90 deals and 90 days [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=97.84s)]
*  promise from Peter Navarro. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=104.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  So Courtney, economically speaking, this is not helpful. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=107.4s)]
*  It's not helpful for the markets, as I mentioned, not helpful for consumer sentiment, not helpful [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=112.16s)]
*  for supply chains. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=117.08s)]
*  Is there a generous reading of this where this is actually quite a good negotiating [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=119.36s)]
*  move and the not helpfulness is all just temporary and we're going to come out in a bigger, better [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=125.0s)]
*  and stronger way at the end of this? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=131.44s)]
*  I think the answer to your question is we don't know. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=134.44s)]
*  And that is the problem. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=137.12s)]
*  I think people tend to think about recessions or economic slowdowns as a giant shock hits the economy [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=138.67999999999998s)]
*  and everyone races to respond. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  And maybe that is the start of a recession or slowdown. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=147.76s)]
*  But I think it's also important to note that businesses not doing anything, which a lot of the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=152.27999999999997s)]
*  businesses I talk to, that's exactly what's happening right now, that freeze moment that can [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=159.11999999999998s)]
*  also cause an economic slowdown. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=166.16s)]
*  Businesses aren't sure what tariff rates are going to be, so perhaps they're rushing to make decisions [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  before a 90-day or month-long window closes. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=174.16s)]
*  And then they're staying put. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  They are not hiring. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  They are not making big capital expenditure or investment decisions, the types of things that are [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=182.08s)]
*  good for economic growth because they just don't know what of these threats are the so-called art of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=187.52s)]
*  the deal and what of them are actually real threats that businesses need to adjust for. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=194.32s)]
*  So that is the question. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=202.08s)]
*  How much of this is the art of the deal, Akayla? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=203.84s)]
*  And that's such a nebulous thing to say. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=206.76s)]
*  It's also a way to put some sort of order on Donald Trump's, at least it seems from the outside, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=208.48s)]
*  his minute-by-minute machinations of what he wants to do. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  I wonder, in your conversations with the White House and from people on his economics team, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=221.0s)]
*  do they actually know what they're doing or are they just waiting and reacting to what the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=228.12s)]
*  president announces? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=232.88s)]
*  Well, that's part of the frustration for the European Union because they don't know exactly what [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=236.08s)]
*  the White House is looking for. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  The European Union has said that they want zero for zero tariffs, essentially will bring our tariffs [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  down to zero if you do the same. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=247.24s)]
*  But there's no indication from the administration that they're willing to do that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=248.88s)]
*  In fact, they're probably not going to go anywhere lower than 10 percent. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=252.44s)]
*  But the EU is preparing for these talks if they do not work out to retaliate if necessary. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=255.8s)]
*  But what is so difficult for this administration is this is a bloc of countries. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=261.44s)]
*  There's 27 members. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=265.68s)]
*  And so it makes those conversations very difficult. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  But the president is looking for some headline deal. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=269.76s)]
*  We know that the EU actually had a proposal last week that the U.S. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=272.92s)]
*  rejected. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=277.24s)]
*  They really want to see some key things, and that is lowering barriers on agricultural [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=277.76s)]
*  products. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=282.88s)]
*  They also want to see a removal of taxes on digital services. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=283.32s)]
*  And those policies vary from country to country, which makes this incredibly difficult. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=287.12s)]
*  And the reason why the EU has been taking their time in these negotiations. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  And yet now they're saying they're going to ramp up the pace of these conversations. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=296.76s)]
*  No doubt about that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  Getting on the same page is a hard thing to do. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=300.96s)]
*  I wonder, do you have a sense, Akaila, that the White House knows what they want out of the EU? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=303.16s)]
*  Well, as I mentioned, they want to see that tax on digital services removed. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=310.96s)]
*  The EU brings in millions of dollars from that tax and also some of these barriers on [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=315.56s)]
*  agricultural products, products like soybeans. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=320.0s)]
*  And these are also some of the things that the EU is thinking about. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=322.36s)]
*  Hey, if these talks do not work out, we are prepared to put restrictions on some of these [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=325.12s)]
*  products, industrial products, agricultural products. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=330.8s)]
*  So there is an out here for the EU and they're using it as a pressure. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  We also know the EU is having conversations with China. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  We see China also making these alliances in case things do not work out with the U.S. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=340.32s)]
*  and we do not see tariffs significantly reduce. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=345.4s)]
*  Yamiche, I guess my question is a little bit broader than that, which is, is there a coherent [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=348.2s)]
*  strategy that you can find coming out of this White House? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=352.36s)]
*  Or is it just Donald Trump deciding minute by minute what he wants to do because he likes [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=356.32s)]
*  tariffs so much? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=360.52s)]
*  I mean, is there a coherent economic strategy that's articulated from the White House that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=361.76s)]
*  makes sense of these, you know, true social posts that come out of nowhere? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=367.76s)]
*  Is this a Scott Besson plan? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=373.88s)]
*  Is it a Howard Lutnick plan? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=375.2s)]
*  Is it a Peter Navarro plan? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  Is there somebody that is putting pen to paper for what the strategy is for this tariff stuff? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=378.47999999999996s)]
*  Or is it just is it being led by Donald Trump? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  But is it only in Donald Trump's head? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=387.35999999999996s)]
*  Based on the conversations that I'm having with White House officials, as well as trade [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=390.12s)]
*  officials, and as well as experts who are looking at all of this from outside the White [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=393.47999999999996s)]
*  House, the feeling is that this is really President Trump's vision and that some of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=397.64s)]
*  this is making it up as he goes because he believes that that's sort of how negotiations [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=402.4s)]
*  and deals need to be made. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=406.79999999999995s)]
*  So when you think about sort of how this even pause went into effect, it's because someone [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=408.08s)]
*  called him personally, again, the leader of the European Commission, to say, hey, let's [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=412.32s)]
*  work this out. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=416.4s)]
*  That's what he's saying. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=417.4s)]
*  And that is essentially saying, OK, well, this is a Donald Trump sort of if you can [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=418.44s)]
*  get to President Trump, get him to talk through this, then maybe that's the way that this [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  can go. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=426.44s)]
*  It's also interesting because over the weekend, the president said that he doesn't want things [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=427.44s)]
*  like T-shirts and socks to be made in the United States. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=430.79999999999995s)]
*  And that's a really interesting point because you have American apparel makers who are saying, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=433.47999999999996s)]
*  well, we want to make T-shirts and socks in the United States. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=436.96s)]
*  And by the way, the biggest fight that the United States is having is with China, which [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  has always been and has been for probably the last 10 decades or should say 10 years, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  they have been the biggest exporter around the world of apparel and things like that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=448.68s)]
*  Everybody started looking at their shirts in the sort of late 90s and 2000s and saw [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=453.48s)]
*  made in China. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=457.72s)]
*  So but that's what we're fighting with and putting this sort of one hundred and forty [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=459.0s)]
*  five percent tariff on and then taking it off and saying that he's going to negotiate [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=462.12s)]
*  with them. So while the president sort of saying all of these things, it's not clear [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=466.12s)]
*  that there's an actual strategy in terms of we're going to write this down and this is [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=469.56s)]
*  exactly what we want for all these deals. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=473.24s)]
*  We know that the president long before he was president has not like trade deficits, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=474.84s)]
*  felt like the United States is being taken advantage of, didn't want manufacturing to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=479.0s)]
*  go abroad. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=482.68s)]
*  But that's sort of the broadest terms of how you look at his trade division. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=483.56s)]
*  It's not quite clear what exactly he wants right now from each of these countries. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=487.8s)]
*  Let's talk about the forecast for what we should expect in the future, Courtney. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=493.32s)]
*  And I'd love to know where things stand on the prospect, according to the big banks and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=497.4s)]
*  people who forecast on a recession and also whether that recession will be coupled with [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=503.16s)]
*  stagflation. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=507.32000000000005s)]
*  After the administration announced that 90 day truce, if you will, that pulled tariffs on [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=510.20000000000005s)]
*  Chinese imports from one hundred and forty five percent to thirty percent, at least for [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=517.5600000000001s)]
*  the next 90 days, you saw a rush of Wall Street banks, sell side analysts revising their [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=522.0400000000001s)]
*  recession forecast. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=529.72s)]
*  At that point, a recession was looking less likely. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=531.1600000000001s)]
*  But you have to have some pity for these economists, right? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=534.84s)]
*  They're trying to think about what's happening with the tax bill, which financial markets were [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=538.6s)]
*  freaking out about last week, very worried about rising U.S. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=544.5200000000001s)]
*  deficits. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=549.4000000000001s)]
*  And now on Friday, we got that Trump truth social post about threatening the EU with 50 percent [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=550.2800000000001s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=557.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, someone I talked to essentially said, can we not do this right now? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=557.48s)]
*  We have to think about what the tax bill is going to do to the economy and rising deficits, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=562.12s)]
*  what that's going to do to financial markets. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=568.12s)]
*  OK, but we thought this trade thing was kind of on the back burner, but I guess not. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=570.44s)]
*  So it's this constant scramble of trying to figure out what policy looks like and then in [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=575.5600000000001s)]
*  turn what that policy is going to mean for the economy. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=581.8000000000001s)]
*  It's kind of an impossible. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=585.4s)]
*  There's also questions when you're talking about the debt and the deficit about the U.S. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=587.72s)]
*  dollar and whether it is the once and will always be almighty dollar. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=591.24s)]
*  I mean, there are no questions about whether buying U.S. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=595.88s)]
*  debt is a good idea. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=599.1600000000001s)]
*  Is it a good long term bet to invest in the United States in that way? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=600.2s)]
*  And that's certainly something that will affect our ability to both rack up debt, but also our [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=604.76s)]
*  ability to grow here in the United States. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=610.44s)]
*  I wonder from your reporting how much of that is under discussion among other European or [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=615.5600000000001s)]
*  other foreign leaders? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=622.7600000000001s)]
*  I think that we certainly know that this is a concern that is top of mind, at least for some [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=625.4000000000001s)]
*  Trump officials. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=630.84s)]
*  Think about what kind of pushed Trump economic officials to try to get Trump to put a freeze on [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=632.12s)]
*  the liberation day tariffs. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=639.56s)]
*  It was the huge financial market volatility we reported months ago that it's no longer the Dow [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=640.76s)]
*  Jones or the S&P 500 that motivates President Trump. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=648.3599999999999s)]
*  It is the bond market. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=652.1199999999999s)]
*  And we're starting to see these bond market freakouts, if you will, more and more. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=654.4399999999999s)]
*  And there is this concern. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=659.0799999999999s)]
*  And I think there's perhaps no concern scarier than the prospect you're raising that the U.S. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=660.92s)]
*  is no longer the world's safe haven. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=668.04s)]
*  It's the sell America trade, if you will. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=671.0s)]
*  It's a frightening prospect for sure. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD1lV91wy2U&t=674.1999999999999s)]
