# The mechanisms of accountability have been dismantled: Baker on Trump’s fringe appointees
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY)
*  So Peter, answer the question. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=0.0s)]
*  Why hasn't this blatant corruption and monetizing of the White House provoked backlash? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=2.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot of causes. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=9.4s)]
*  I think first of all, he does so many things all the time that it's hard to focus on any [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=11.48s)]
*  single action. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=16.5s)]
*  The plane kind of penetrated. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=18.0s)]
*  The plane broke through. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=19.5s)]
*  People got the plane. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=20.68s)]
*  But for the most part, they're not paying attention to the cryptocurrency that he's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=21.88s)]
*  made $320 million, he and his family, and related business. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=24.76s)]
*  They've not paid attention to all the building projects in the Middle East, even in Vietnam, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=28.56s)]
*  that his sons are busy sealing deals. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  There are so many different ways that they have found to cash in. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=38.68s)]
*  It's hard to keep up. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=41.72s)]
*  The other thing is, of course, Republicans are on the Hill, not willing to challenge [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=43.08s)]
*  him on this. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=46.08s)]
*  Frankly, even Democrats on the Hill are kind of debating among themselves. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=47.08s)]
*  Is this something they want to focus on, or do they want to focus on bread and butter [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=49.78s)]
*  issues where they think they may have more traction with voters? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=53.56s)]
*  So much of this, Democrats that I talked to, they feel like so much of it is baked in with [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=56.44s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=60.36s)]
*  When you talk to voters, apparently they're not surprised that he's trying to make money [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=61.36s)]
*  off the presidency. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=65.24s)]
*  They're not surprised by that dinner. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=66.24s)]
*  They're not surprised by the more than $300 million his family seems to be making off [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=67.48s)]
*  of this cryptocurrency. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=71.0s)]
*  Von, one of the things that was fascinating about the first term was that bad headlines [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=72.48s)]
*  did seem to move him. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=77.92s)]
*  A lot of people said a lot of bad things. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=81.08s)]
*  Sometimes Donald Trump changed course just a little bit. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=82.44s)]
*  That's not the same anymore. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=85.08s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=86.08s)]
*  There's no consequences to the bad headlines when you look at it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=87.08s)]
*  He lived through the worst headlines really of really any president over the last century. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=90.7s)]
*  When he was indicted four different times, he was found guilty. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  I mean, he literally had allegations of having sex with another woman for the whole country [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=99.32s)]
*  to hear. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=106.6s)]
*  And yet there's no shame because millions of Americans voted him back into office here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=107.6s)]
*  And so on the same thing on the financial front. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=111.92s)]
*  In 2017, we were having conversations about emoluments and whether the president was going [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=114.8s)]
*  to be divesting and the extent to which his sons were going to be operating separately [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=119.0s)]
*  from him. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=124.6s)]
*  Those conversations are so far gone now that this is just a matter of how can he capitalize [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=125.6s)]
*  here in the presidency in the immediacy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=131.48s)]
*  He's got four years to do it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  And if he is able to convince the country that his policies are benefiting them and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=135.64s)]
*  that this really is the corruption is just hearsay and really not that important, then, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=140.12s)]
*  well, he could have a J.D. Vance or a Don Jr. go back into the White House come 2029. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=145.72s)]
*  And essentially that sort of business operation can continue. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=151.12s)]
*  Well, which is why I think we should just go back to the used plane that Jonathan so [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=153.6s)]
*  much. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  Jonathan likes to remind us that it's a used plane. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  Last week there was reporting that the plane was a done deal. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=161.16s)]
*  And I kind of compared it to when I see like a shirt or dress in a store and I like rip [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=164.96s)]
*  the tags off and wear it out of the store. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=169.08s)]
*  Like he was bringing that plane home. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=170.68s)]
*  He was taking it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  But then now there's reporting that the plane isn't a done deal. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=173.68s)]
*  So, Peter, what are you hearing about the plane? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I got to understandably want some legal assurances here. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=180.56s)]
*  Right. I think they want to follow certain rules, even if everybody else doesn't. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  They want assurances that when the plane basically is transferred to his presidential library, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  I think this is what's really behind it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=193.36s)]
*  They're not held responsible for that, because in fact, it is a gift. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=194.4s)]
*  If he has it brought not just from the airport, the Air Force that he can use for official [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=198.0s)]
*  functions, but later on in his private life after he leaves office, it becomes available [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=202.4s)]
*  to him. That's a very different thing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=206.4s)]
*  And Cutler seems nervous about the legalities there and they're trying to figure out how [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=207.92s)]
*  to work. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=211.0s)]
*  There's a lot of irony there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=212.0s)]
*  A lot of irony there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=213.56s)]
*  But no, I was just going to say nothing matters, though, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=216.48s)]
*  Like the podcast you the podcast you reported on that just got appointed, you're [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=221.12s)]
*  reporting like really bad things. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=225.88s)]
*  Paul and Gracia, I think this is somebody who is going to be saying overseeing the office [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=228.6s)]
*  of the special counsel. This is the person who is supposed to be in charge of prosecutorial [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=233.16s)]
*  powers. It's an independent agency over the Hatch Act. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=237.04s)]
*  This is somebody who I saw frequently out on the campaign trail. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=240.04s)]
*  He was also a frequent president at Mar-a-Lago in twenty twenty three, twenty twenty four. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  But basically somebody that I perceive to be so fringe, an ally of John Eastman. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=247.96s)]
*  Right. And Michael Flynn, that he had a hard time ever seeing him actually being put into [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  an administration position. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=258.32s)]
*  And that's exactly what the president is seeking to do. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=259.8s)]
*  He is somebody that is called for a national holiday for January 6th. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=262.56s)]
*  He has called for a million dollars in reparations for January 6th defendants. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=266.32s)]
*  He's called for the jailing of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  He's called Mike Pence an FBI asset. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=273.56s)]
*  He's advised Andrew Tate. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=275.76s)]
*  That is somebody who is going into this independent agency that is supposed to be [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=277.52s)]
*  effectively a watchdog within the executive branch. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  I think the important part, too, by the way, why no outrage? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=284.88s)]
*  Because, in fact, the mechanisms of accountability have been systematically [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=288.64s)]
*  dismantled, right? He's put in very partisan people at offices like the Office of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=292.44s)]
*  Special Counsel, fired the professionals who were there before, fired the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=297.12s)]
*  inspector general, fired FBI agents and prosecutors of the Justice Department who [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  were part of prosecutions against him or January 6th defendants. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=304.64s)]
*  The lesson is very clear. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=307.56s)]
*  You're not going to investigate things that are going wrong if they are at the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  White House. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=312.2s)]
*  One of the things that I've talked to some folks in the White House about is that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  he does he does he's feeling besieged more than usual, as all of this happens, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=317.24s)]
*  especially after the plane. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  But when he gets his back up against the wall, he does tend to lash out and react [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=323.44s)]
*  in kind of a really surprising way. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=328.2s)]
*  And without those guardrails that we have, what do you anticipate how he reacts to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=330.32s)]
*  some of this stuff? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=334.84s)]
*  You know, you don't want to be at Harvard right now. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=335.56s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=337.56s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=338.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  He picks his favorite targets. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=339.08s)]
*  Every time he is under pressure, every time the terror thing isn't going well, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=340.56s)]
*  right, then we stir up some other conflict. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=344.64s)]
*  And the conflict is good for him politically, as he sees it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=347.67999999999995s)]
*  Harvard is a convenient target. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=350.32s)]
*  His base doesn't love Harvard. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  They're happy to see him take on, you know, the big liberal elitists of the of the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=353.28s)]
*  elites. Exactly. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=357.64s)]
*  Vaughn, there's this NBC News headline. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=359.4s)]
*  Army says Trump's military parade could cause 16 million dollars in damage to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=362.48s)]
*  Washington streets. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=369.04s)]
*  This got me pissed hot, man. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=369.96s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=372.48s)]
*  We got World Pride on one Saturday here in the streets of Washington. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=373.48s)]
*  We've got the Army parade. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=376.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=378.24s)]
*  But let's tell everybody what this parade is going to have. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=378.76s)]
*  It will include about 130 vehicles, including 28 M1A1 tanks, 28 Bradley [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=381.84s)]
*  fighting vehicles, 28 striker armored fighting vehicles and a number of vehicles [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=387.96s)]
*  towing artillery launchers. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=392.4s)]
*  More than 50 helicopters will also participate in an extensive flyover in [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=394.56s)]
*  the nation's capital. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=399.24s)]
*  This is supposed to be a celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Army. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=400.84s)]
*  But it also happens when what's so conveniently the same day as this parade, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=406.04s)]
*  Vaughn, the president's birthday. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=410.76s)]
*  This is, you know, nine thousand soldiers are anticipated to be coming here into [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=414.0s)]
*  the streets of Washington as well. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=419.12s)]
*  And in so many ways, the military is a function that keeps Americans safe and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=420.6s)]
*  something to be celebrated at the same time. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=427.12s)]
*  This is not a normal [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=429.36s)]
*  type of function in the United States. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=432.0s)]
*  And the president clearly, despite 16 million dollars, there's the anticipated [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=434.36s)]
*  cost for street repairs here, something that he is seeking to move forward. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=439.2s)]
*  And Peter Baker, you, of everyone around this table, knows exactly why he wants [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=443.84s)]
*  this parade. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=449.32s)]
*  He's been pining for this parade since the first term. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=450.08s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=452.84s)]
*  And this is, by the way, an example of how things he didn't do or get to do in [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=453.56s)]
*  the first term. He's doing the second term, right? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=456.64s)]
*  He went to the Bastille Day celebration in France with President Macron. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=458.88s)]
*  And he loved it. He said, why can't we have a military parade? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=462.88s)]
*  I love this idea of a military parade. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=465.68s)]
*  And in fact, and we reported on this in our book, there was a lot of resistance [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=467.47999999999996s)]
*  from the military. This is what we do. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=471.52s)]
*  This is not what we do. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=473.28s)]
*  In fact, Paul Selva, a general who was the vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=474.44s)]
*  said, Mr. President, you know, I grew up in Portugal when it was a military [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=478.68s)]
*  dictatorship. That's what they did. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  We don't do that. That's what dictators do. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=483.32s)]
*  And that managed to, you know, he managed to keep him doing the first term. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=486.2s)]
*  In the second term, all holds are off. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=489.68s)]
*  He's like, oh, what? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=491.76s)]
*  What are the things that he didn't get done first term that you think are [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=493.47999999999996s)]
*  potential hot button issues? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  One thing that surprised me, where's Mike Flynn? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=499.84s)]
*  Why didn't he reappoint Mike Flynn? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=502.0s)]
*  It's the way don't hear from your lips. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=503.84s)]
*  If he's watching, he's not. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=507.12s)]
*  But I think to Vaughn's point, like there doesn't seem to be a line this time [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=509.64s)]
*  about people who are seen as fringe, who are seen as too far. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=513.64s)]
*  Right. Look who we put in at FBI. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=517.4s)]
*  Look who we put in at so many different places and people who never would have [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=519.12s)]
*  been thought possible even in the first term or now in the second term. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=522.84s)]
*  What about Laura Loomer, who isn't even in the administration? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=525.8s)]
*  National security adviser. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=528.4399999999999s)]
*  She's getting cops left and right, though. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=529.96s)]
*  Vaughn, what do you think? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=531.4s)]
*  This influence. I think in a lot of ways, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=532.3199999999999s)]
*  I would question what what educationally is the next generation going to be taking [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=535.3199999999999s)]
*  here from the moment? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=541.52s)]
*  Because we're watching this play out on a national stage. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=542.68s)]
*  I'm going to bring my Arizona roots in for a moment. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=545.0799999999999s)]
*  I watched a lot of this through Joe Arpaio back in the early 2000s. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  I remember it was the Christmas light parade out in Phoenix that happened annually. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=551.68s)]
*  It was Joe Arpaio that would go on the streets of Phoenix in a tank. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=556.16s)]
*  Right. He ended up for efforts to go and move forward with his own mass [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=559.88s)]
*  deportation program. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=564.16s)]
*  He ultimately the court found him to have engaged in racial profiling. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=565.44s)]
*  And then when they told him to stop, he in his office didn't stop. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=569.4s)]
*  They found it in contempt. He was guilty. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=572.12s)]
*  And for all the conversation about all [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=574.24s)]
*  these pardons that Donald Trump has doled out this month, if you go back to 2017, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=576.68s)]
*  the very first pardon, the worst pardons of all, it was August of 2017. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=581.72s)]
*  And it was to Joe Arpaio. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=586.64s)]
*  And so once again, I think that all of these confluence events here are just [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=588.2s)]
*  accelerated in such a way that I think is going to be a defining moment here in [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=592.64s)]
*  American history, because when you look at the impact that people like Joe Arpaio [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=597.44s)]
*  and some of these fringe figures had in places around the country, he's just doing [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=601.48s)]
*  this on such a scale in 2025 that I think we are so far from even [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=605.32s)]
*  comprehending what kids that are growing up watching this today are going to just [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=608.96s)]
*  see as normal. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-Iu7jmXWY&t=613.0400000000001s)]
