# Enough! Trump roasted for ‘Scrooge' cruelty on tariffs by Wall St. allies amid ‘empty shelves’ fears
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw)
*  And we are covering this fallout from Trump's ailing trade war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=0.0s)]
*  Markets have tanked, and they did stabilize a bit over the hopes the tariffs would end. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=3.38s)]
*  Now they remain low, and the reality is setting in, which is our top story, because we are [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=7.76s)]
*  seeing the MAGA talking points stretched to the breaking point in trying to defend the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=12.96s)]
*  ongoing cost of the trade war. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=18.16s)]
*  There are now comparisons of President Trump to Scrooge himself, the villain in A Christmas [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=20.02s)]
*  Carol or Scrooge McDuck, if you remember that version, who infamously opposed any holiday [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=26.02s)]
*  cheer. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=31.34s)]
*  Also comparisons to Marie Antoinette, as the economic newspaper The Financial Times says [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=32.94s)]
*  that Trump has reached the negative Marie Antoinette moment, let them eat cake, as he [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  calls for national sacrifice. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  The Times says it's falling flat since it's a sacrifice of Trump's own making, his own [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=45.1s)]
*  policies. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=50.94s)]
*  Meanwhile, the economy is revealing more and more ominous cracks. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=51.94s)]
*  That is the President's trade war now leading to big questions about where this economy [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=111.94s)]
*  is heading. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=116.02s)]
*  Somebody said, oh, the shelves are going to be open. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=117.02s)]
*  Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=119.38s)]
*  will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=124.7s)]
*  Excuse me, the guy with marble fountains and a golden country club is lecturing us on the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=127.02s)]
*  folly of material possessions. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=130.74s)]
*  The guy we all know is this character from The White Lotus. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=132.5s)]
*  I just don't think at this age I'm meant to live an uncomfortable life. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=135.86s)]
*  There you have it, from the reel to the punchlines. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=141.82s)]
*  And you'll notice we went through the 100 days. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=143.78s)]
*  We are now past it, the now infamous doll remark coming one day past the 100 day mark. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=145.92s)]
*  The President's talk of fewer toys has drawn mockery as an obvious gaffe. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=152.18s)]
*  That includes even from some conservative media. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=156.7s)]
*  And it's living on as Trump doubles down on his version of some kind of austerity defense. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=159.54s)]
*  When you say they could have three dolls instead of 30 dolls, are you saying you're... [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=167.06s)]
*  Americans could see empty store shelves? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  No, I'm not saying that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=173.94s)]
*  I'm just saying they don't need to have 30 dolls. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=175.78s)]
*  They can have three. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=177.9s)]
*  They don't need to have 250 pencils. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=178.9s)]
*  They can have five. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=180.74s)]
*  But you're basically saying there could be some supply shortages because of the tariffs. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=182.74s)]
*  I'm basically saying we don't have to waste money on a trade deficit with China for things [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=186.9s)]
*  we don't need, for junk that we don't need. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=191.26s)]
*  Don't buy junk, the President says. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  Remember, this is all coming out of the negative. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=197.3s)]
*  He first promised manufacturing would come back. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=200.22s)]
*  Peter Navarro said the trade deals were being negotiated and written as we speak. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=203.22s)]
*  No manufacturing has come back. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=207.26s)]
*  No trade deals have yet materialized in public. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=208.54s)]
*  If they do, we'll report on them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=210.58s)]
*  But we've gone from just those false and hollow claims and predictions to now the President [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=212.54s)]
*  telling people not to buy foreign junk or to buy toys or pencils. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=216.78s)]
*  But where does he think these things come from? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=222.38s)]
*  It's becoming a kind of austerity plan where he just tells everyone sort of blithely, don't [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=225.86s)]
*  buy stuff that kids might need. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=230.74s)]
*  And it brings these comparisons, as I mentioned, of Trump to Scrooge or Scrooge McDuck, everyone's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=233.5s)]
*  favorite Scrooge if you had to pick one, tomato, tomato. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=238.62s)]
*  But the point is that that is his allies, including in some conservative outlets, like [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=241.3s)]
*  I mentioned, embracing the branding of a greedy rich person who is out of touch as a kind of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=246.78000000000003s)]
*  warning signal to Trump. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=252.74s)]
*  Meanwhile, here's domestically, on more the political side, what concerns Republican strategists. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=255.26s)]
*  I thought it was really problematic when he said, well, you know what, the kids, those [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=262.98s)]
*  little girls at Christmas, they don't need $30. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=267.02s)]
*  They can do it too. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=269.38s)]
*  And if they have to pay a couple more bucks for them, you know, OK, well, it sounds like [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=270.38s)]
*  Mr. Scrooge. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=273.58s)]
*  I think it's really damaging messaging. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=274.98s)]
*  It's a little bit of a let them eat cake moment, I think, for the president. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=277.14s)]
*  Again, those are both Republicans. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=281.26s)]
*  The concerns there, as stated, are about messaging or spin or PR, as we all hear it [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=283.78s)]
*  in politics. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=288.73999999999995s)]
*  But that messaging is about an underlying reality. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=289.73999999999995s)]
*  And I want to remind you, this isn't going away. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=293.05999999999995s)]
*  This is our life. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=295.34s)]
*  This is why we cover the news, whether we like what's happening or not. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=296.34s)]
*  The reality under Trump is the tariff costs on Americans go well beyond the toys. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=299.34s)]
*  There are mounting construction costs. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=304.17999999999995s)]
*  There's concern about cracks in the housing market. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=305.9s)]
*  Then there's a brand in America that's so big, Donald Trump has tried to get in on its [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=309.26s)]
*  cache. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=313.06s)]
*  McDonald's noting, and there's Trump, you might remember in the campaign, actually cosplaying [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=314.06s)]
*  as a McDonald's worker. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=319.78s)]
*  But that company is now noting that the tariffs from Trump are hurting McDonald's and eventually [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  consumers. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=327.38s)]
*  On the smaller scale, regular local businesses say tariffs could put them under. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=329.18s)]
*  Big retailers warning of the empty shelves in a matter of weeks, something you heard [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=333.97999999999996s)]
*  Kristen Welker mention to the president. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=337.34s)]
*  And meanwhile, there's a context to all this. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=339.97999999999996s)]
*  And this part might be a little obvious, but I want to emphasize it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=342.26000000000005s)]
*  Trump is saying less dolls for you, but he still wants more money, payouts and perks [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=345.62s)]
*  for himself. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=350.38000000000005s)]
*  He's pocketing millions in these digital currency projects. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=351.78000000000003s)]
*  He's hawking access to the White House for donations, some of which may not be traceable [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=354.78000000000003s)]
*  through this crypto, let alone accountable. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  The Times reports that Trump's sons, Don and Eric, are also continuing to get big payouts [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=362.62s)]
*  in these foreign country deals, a luxury hotel in Dubai, a second high residential [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=367.58s)]
*  tower in Saudi Arabia, a new golf course and villa complex in Qatar, all of this in New [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=372.06s)]
*  Times reporting. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=377.18s)]
*  And that is just the money side of the alleged grift and abuse. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=379.0s)]
*  Remember, many of Trump's other efforts to abuse federal power, which are going on now [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=383.41999999999996s)]
*  and been debated right now, are still in exchange for rewards for himself. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=387.65999999999997s)]
*  They're grinding forward, even though they're not all initially monetary like the crypto. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=393.3s)]
*  So consider how many of those bids, I want to remind you, they boil down to Trump trying [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=398.06s)]
*  to get something for himself out of his public service, which is supposed to be for you, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=403.46000000000004s)]
*  for public interest, paid by tax dollars. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=408.94s)]
*  He's not supposed to settle scores, let alone demand payouts and shakedowns, but he's targeting [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=410.98s)]
*  law firms and demanding they spend money on time on his chosen projects. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=415.62s)]
*  Allegedly, CBS's parent company has been under the impression, they think, from Trump [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=421.62s)]
*  and his allies that they have to soften Trump coverage, that's the gift he wants, in order [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=426.46000000000004s)]
*  to have the Trump administration approve a business deal. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=431.1s)]
*  This is also part of the gap and the grift. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=434.62s)]
*  Critics say it is obvious pay for play, as we reported. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=438.3s)]
*  The nonpartisan 60 Minutes chief resigned over this. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=441.18s)]
*  Others might try blowing the whistle or talking to reporters anonymously while holding on [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=444.46000000000004s)]
*  to their jobs. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=449.34000000000003s)]
*  Everyone's in the economic position to quit in protest in the middle of a career. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=450.38s)]
*  Many experts say that grift, as exposed here in the first hundred days, is probably just [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=455.94s)]
*  the tip of the iceberg. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=460.58s)]
*  And so that's all going on, the pocketing, the deals, the pay for play, while Trump continues [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=462.82s)]
*  to lecture the general public, the regular American family, about cutting back on dolls [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=468.78s)]
*  or pencils. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=473.97999999999996s)]
*  It is quite a contrast. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=475.62s)]
*  If you saw it in a movie about some politician that was not on the level, you might say it [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=476.94s)]
*  was a bit too overdone. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=482.02000000000004s)]
*  Trump's Republican allies, who used to hammer inflation costs in the Biden era, was a big [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=484.74s)]
*  topic of the debate. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=488.66s)]
*  Now, those Republicans say paying the higher price of this Trump era is, I guess, some [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=490.34000000000003s)]
*  kind of acceptable part of pain for Americans. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=495.22s)]
*  No pain, no gain. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=501.22s)]
*  That's what we used to tell our football players. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=502.46000000000004s)]
*  There's going to be some pain with tariffs. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=504.26000000000005s)]
*  And there could be some pain along the way. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=505.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=507.74s)]
*  But you will be thankful once you go through the tough stuff. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=508.74s)]
*  There's absolutely going to be short-term pain. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=512.26s)]

*  He kind of coughed that up when pressed by NBC's Kristen Welker in this new interview. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=568.8199999999999s)]

*  It is, but now it's going up. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=593.26s)]

*  Do you take responsibility when it drops? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=597.26s)]

*  more than three months. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=602.74s)]
*  It has been just over three months. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=604.94s)]
*  That's also part of Trump's problem. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=607.5400000000001s)]

*  One could say from the markets to the mall, to the windows to the wall. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAENzhAKgcw&t=644.32s)]
