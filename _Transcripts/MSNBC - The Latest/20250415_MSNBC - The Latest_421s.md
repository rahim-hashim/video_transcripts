# 'Political blackmail': Trump admin freezes $2 billion in funds after Harvard rejects demands
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc)
*  So, John, let's start with you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=0.0s)]
*  The government demanding that Harvard share all hiring and admissions data for a federal [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=2.04s)]
*  audit, demanding they hire an external watchdog, which, quote, shall satisfy the federal government. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=6.66s)]
*  Does the executive have this level of power and authority? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=12.74s)]
*  Well, you know, Jose, I think that the situation is this all started with the issue of anti-Semitism. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  In fact, there have been a number of big, big givers. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=23.88s)]
*  In fact, one from my own hometown who's cut off all funding because Harvard, they're not [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=27.28s)]
*  just sending any more money to them because of the anti-Semitism that they saw after the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  attack on the Israelis. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=39.32s)]
*  I think the best way this gets handled is one, for benefactors to decide whether they [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=42.08s)]
*  want to give or parents who say, I don't want my son or daughter to go there or students [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=47.52s)]
*  to say no. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=53.34s)]
*  There are rules, by the way, when it comes to these grants that Congress has put into effect. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=54.76s)]
*  So I'm not sure exactly what those are, but there have always been some strings attached. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=59.96s)]
*  But this looks like this is far more aggressive. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=64.2s)]
*  I would hope it would be limited to the anti-Semitism, not to go any deeper than that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=67.24s)]
*  But you know, going to see how this is going to play out. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=72.4s)]
*  This may end up in court, Jose. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=74.42s)]
*  And Tom, in a letter, Harvard president Garber agreed that some demands aim to fight anti-Semitism, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=76.36s)]
*  he said the majority are about government control. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=83.36s)]
*  Where do you think the line here is? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=85.91999999999999s)]
*  Well, Jose, I spent the bulk of my career in federal service at the Justice Department [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  working under Republican and Democratic presidents. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=93.6s)]
*  I oversaw investigations like this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=97.24s)]
*  If you are truly interested in understanding the truth and making sure that an institution [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=100.22s)]
*  is complying with all of its statutory requirements, this is what you should do. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=107.04s)]
*  This is what Republican and Democratic presidents until now did. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=113.12s)]
*  You send a letter addressing your concerns. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=117.02s)]
*  You tell them that we are going to initiate an investigation. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=119.76s)]
*  That investigation will be a search for the truth. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=123.94s)]
*  That's what we did for 40 years under the Civil Rights Act, 50 years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=127.42s)]
*  That's not what they're doing here. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=133.28s)]
*  What's taking place here amounts to political blackmail of sorts. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=134.84s)]
*  This is the ready fire aim approach. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=141.24s)]
*  Harvard may be able to survive this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=146.68s)]
*  They do have resources. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=149.6s)]
*  But I think about smaller universities that don't have the resources to counteract this. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  That's what disturbs me and should disturb everyone. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=156.88s)]
*  What the president did this morning, another tweet, but what he didn't do was talk about [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=161.4s)]
*  the fact that grocery prices are still going up. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=166.2s)]
*  Eggs are exorbitant. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=169.2s)]
*  People who luckily have a 401K, it's turned into a 201K. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=171.84s)]
*  This whole issue is a distraction. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  Harvard has taken steps. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=178.72s)]
*  Can they take more steps? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=180.44s)]
*  Possibly. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  They should always think about that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  But what's going on here is not on the level. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  And so, Tom, just thinking about those 40 years of public service that you have on your belt, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=187.88000000000002s)]
*  the letters that justice departments or presidents through their executive authority would send [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=193.88000000000002s)]
*  to institutions around our country, what were some of the concerns that those presidents [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  had when they sent those letters? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=207.88000000000002s)]
*  And was there any action taken by the universities that received those letters? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=210.24s)]
*  Was there any change carried out because of a letter or a concern being sent to universities? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=216.4s)]
*  Yeah, we worked frequently and collaboratively with not only universities, but with other [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=223.88000000000002s)]
*  recipients of federal financial assistance. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  We worked with hospitals to make sure that they had programs and practices in place so [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=233.84s)]
*  if someone was limited English proficient, they could come to the hospital and meaningfully [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=239.4s)]
*  access those services. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  In the higher ed setting, we worked on a host of issues relating to educational opportunity [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=245.5s)]
*  for everyone. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=252.74s)]
*  And again, these investigations, 98% of them, we did them collaboratively. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=254.22s)]
*  And we were genuinely, what we saw is the university was cooperative and the reason [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=261.74s)]
*  they were cooperative is because they understood what we were doing was on the level. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=271.14s)]
*  This just isn't on the level, Jose. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=275.3s)]
*  This is unlike anything I've seen. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  And again, I started my first job in the Justice Department, Ronald Reagan was president. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=279.58s)]
*  When I started there as a career civil servant, George Herbert Walker Bush was president. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=283.7s)]
*  And they comported themselves so differently. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=290.26s)]
*  The Reagan, Bush, Bush 2, Clinton, Obama, that paradigm was a paradigm that was able [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=294.62s)]
*  to effectuate change, but it was fair and it was on the level. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=303.06s)]
*  This isn't on the level. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=307.86s)]
*  John, what do you see as the political strategy behind this? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=309.26s)]
*  Well, look, first of all, there is no question that there are increasing concerns about what's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=313.5s)]
*  happening at our universities. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=319.98s)]
*  You want them to be independent. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=321.58s)]
*  That's the kind of intellectual independence that you want to see. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=324.5s)]
*  But what I can tell you, Jose, I didn't see it in the state of Ohio with the legislature [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=328.82s)]
*  getting worked up, that students are in the classroom or getting shut down by professors. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=333.78s)]
*  They're not being treated fairly. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=339.14s)]
*  If you explain a different point of view, that you can be punished. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=341.42s)]
*  Look, I just had an experience with a guy who I know teaches at Yale. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=345.06s)]
*  And I mean, I'm absolutely convinced that if I were in his class and I wasn't saying [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=349.42s)]
*  what he wanted me to say, I wouldn't get a good grade. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=354.38s)]
*  I mean, I think these are the concerns. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=357.06s)]
*  But fundamentally, fundamentally at Harvard and some a number of these schools, there [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=359.5s)]
*  is great, great concern about the unwillingness of those institutions to stand up against [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=364.74s)]
*  this anti-Semitism. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=371.9s)]
*  It's a serious problem in our country, in our institutions. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=373.34s)]
*  But look, this too shall find balance. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=377.14s)]
*  I respect what Tom's saying with the fact that he's been in the middle of this. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=379.94s)]
*  But there has to be a recognition that universities are now being told, you know, look, we got [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=383.96s)]
*  to give students a chance to learn and they ought to have an opportunity to express many [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=388.96s)]
*  different points of view. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=393.56s)]
*  And if you don't do that, then there may not be there may not be the money for you that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=395.4s)]
*  comes from the government. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjj--yXhGCc&t=399.38s)]
