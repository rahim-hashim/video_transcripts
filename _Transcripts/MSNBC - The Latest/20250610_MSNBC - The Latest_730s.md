# Marines in streets: Trump hit for 'illegal' crackdown after anti-police pardons (Melber report)
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ)
*  Overall, the initial protests over these ICE raids have clearly morphed into something [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=0.0s)]
*  larger. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=5.46s)]
*  The president seeking this conflict, seeking a chance to use what are clearly extraordinary [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=6.7s)]
*  powers, unusual powers, rarely deployed federal powers, while overruling the sitting governor [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=13.66s)]
*  of the state. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=20.34s)]
*  Democrats have been pushing back. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=22.26s)]
*  They are taking him to court, as mentioned. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=23.26s)]
*  But overall, in what is still an early period in the second term of this unusual Trump presidency, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=25.5s)]
*  the nation is facing a wider reckoning over a president who confesses what are improper [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=31.72s)]
*  goals. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=39.04s)]
*  Recently arresting some opponents in the Democratic Party because they disagree with him. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=40.66s)]
*  In a case that, again, a lot's going on, you're forgiven if it's hard to keep track, but that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  that arrest, very dramatic of a Democratic mayor in his own city, dropped. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=51.5s)]
*  The case fell apart. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=57.260000000000005s)]
*  The lawyers tasked with defending the arrest admitted a type of wrongdoing in court. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=59.38s)]
*  That mayor is now suing the Trump administration, but that would appear to be an improper use [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=64.10000000000001s)]
*  of force by evidence of the fact that they didn't even stick with the case. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=69.02000000000001s)]
*  But remember, this week, as we see soldiers in the streets, the president is threatening [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=73.14s)]
*  the same type of arrest against the California governor in this clash, Governor Newsom. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=77.84s)]
*  He's basically said bring it on. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=83.84s)]
*  But that is where we are. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=86.56s)]
*  And Trump is leaning into this very controversy over the use of these powers in the guard, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=88.98s)]
*  warning a big force against protesters, which would sound like people exercising constitutional [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=94.36s)]
*  rights if they peacefully protest. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=99.92s)]
*  But that's his warning to people who might come to the planned DC parade this weekend. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=102.82s)]
*  If there's any protest that wants to come out, they will be met with very big force, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=107.74s)]
*  by the way. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=113.13999999999999s)]
*  If those people that want to protest, they're going to be met with very big force. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=114.13999999999999s)]
*  Let's take this seriously. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=119.44s)]
*  Protests met with big force. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=123.17999999999999s)]
*  The public warning from the sitting president. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  This isn't campaign rhetoric. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=127.13999999999999s)]
*  This isn't some lurching, sloppy statement somewhere along the line being taken out of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=128.78s)]
*  context. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=134.22s)]
*  This is being said right now by your president as he tests whether he can get away with putting [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=135.22s)]
*  Marines in the streets. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=139.54s)]
*  And not just any streets, the streets of California, which he has publicly said he views as the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=141.86s)]
*  type of place filled with the type of Americans that he wants to patrol, that he views as [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=146.26s)]
*  some type of opponent. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=150.74s)]
*  But like every president, Donald Trump took an oath in public to uphold the Constitution. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=152.94s)]
*  And so we can report as news, even if it sounds like bad news, that the president is quite [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=162.14s)]
*  blatantly undercutting the oath he took today by vowing big force for people exercising [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=167.44s)]
*  constitutional rights to assemble and protest and speak while using this rare, courts haven't [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=175.6s)]
*  said whether it's illegal or not, but rare instance of extreme military style federal [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  force in California. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=188.34s)]
*  You have the statement matched by the action. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=190.42s)]
*  This week's clash, which clearly is not an overnight event, is one of Trump's choosing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=193.62s)]
*  What started with deportation powers is now about limits potentially on Trump's power. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=199.54s)]
*  The president does not have the legal power to police daily life in states and cities. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=205.34s)]
*  That is what states do under federalism. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=212.46s)]
*  That's why you have state officers, state representatives that you vote for, local police, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=215.98000000000002s)]
*  not federal agents running through your home. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=224.38s)]
*  President also doesn't have the legal power to silence or threaten dissent, although it [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=228.36s)]
*  is clear that he welcomes a clash on those terms. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=232.74s)]
*  As for the actual protests, let's tell you here in the news what we know. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=237.12s)]
*  They have occurred now across roughly four days. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=242.82000000000002s)]
*  Hundreds of people have gathered in different locations. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=246.3s)]
*  On Monday night, there were about 100 arrests. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=250.02s)]
*  There were some violent incidents. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=253.56s)]
*  The situation required law enforcement, which traditionally patrols these areas. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=256.18s)]
*  But these gatherings, to be clear, although there are some dramatic moments in footage, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  just by the scale, and we've covered this and we have our reporters on the ground there, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  these gatherings are not anywhere near Los Angeles' largest security challenges. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  This clash has now brought out more protests in other places, people deciding to speak [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=275.56s)]
*  up, to be counted, that they see what's happening in Los Angeles. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=280.42s)]
*  And we've seen this in San Francisco, Austin, Atlanta. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=284.68s)]
*  People are taking action. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=287.76s)]
*  They want to stand, they say, many of them from the signs and the coverage we have, against [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=288.92s)]
*  an effort by Donald Trump to take a showdown that involved a lot of peaceful protests and, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=293.36s)]
*  as mentioned, some prosecutable incidents. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=299.76s)]
*  But for him to try to take that and turn it into the rationale to deploy the National [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=303.34000000000003s)]
*  Guard or now the Marines in these other places, people are standing up. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=307.58000000000004s)]
*  And this is a democracy. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=313.36s)]
*  So against pressure, there is still, until and unless the Constitution actually breaks [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=314.48s)]
*  and we live in a different kind of country, there is obviously, this is just a fact, a [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  role for the people to stand up or stand down, to get engaged or sit it out. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=323.72s)]
*  But it's a decision in a democracy people still make, which is a point that our colleague [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=330.44s)]
*  Rachel Maddow made on MSNBC just last night, which we can observe drew some headlines about [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=335.02000000000004s)]
*  how to respond to this test that President Trump clearly wants. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=341.24s)]
*  Will he succeed? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=349.04s)]
*  Will he get what he wants? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=351.0s)]
*  And the answer to that will not be found by looking at him or by watching his actions. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  The answer to that question will come from the people of this country. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=361.96000000000004s)]
*  The most important story of our time is this one. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=366.96s)]
*  What is this country going to allow him to do? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=372.12s)]
*  As the nation observes Marines working on the ground in Los Angeles tonight, many are [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=376.28s)]
*  really wondering, is this even legal? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=381.44s)]
*  Now California officials think these deployments are not legal. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=385.32s)]
*  They are pressing the point in court. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=389.24s)]
*  They're intending to get the judicial branch to side with them. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=391.29999999999995s)]
*  What is among other things now a clash between state and federal power. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=394.68s)]
*  Late today, California seeking emergency relief to try to stop these deployments we've been [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=399.29999999999995s)]
*  telling you about. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=403.78s)]
*  A new filing states that Trump's federal antagonization with soldiers in the streets has already caused [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=404.78s)]
*  quote real and irreparable damage to LA. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=410.76s)]
*  Now that statement there, which is a claim and a lawsuit, right? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=414.76s)]
*  That refers to basically one of the required standards to even get the judge to intervene [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=418.52s)]
*  on an emergency basis. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=423.97999999999996s)]
*  California is arguing Trump's deployment must be stopped immediately. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  It's a push that comes as the president has now doubled the total guard forces to 4,000. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=430.79999999999995s)]
*  Under law, it's pretty simple. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=436.24s)]
*  US troops cannot be deployed for domestic law enforcement. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  You can't send the army to someone's house to do a drug search or to look for things. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=444.64s)]
*  That's always been the case. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=451.71999999999997s)]
*  In fact, it is a key line to prevent any potential abuse of military powers against US citizens. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  And there's really only one rare instance where you could have an exception to that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=461.02s)]
*  And that's if there's basically the kind of insurrection or rebellion that could then [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=465.44s)]
*  be invoked to suspend what otherwise is the limit on the military from operating on our [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=469.88s)]
*  streets. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=475.8s)]
*  Now, if you're thinking, okay, well, that sounds rare. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=476.8s)]
*  It is. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=480.2s)]
*  Indeed, in our entire modern era, the only violent effort to overthrow the US government [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=481.2s)]
*  on par with an insurrection in modern history was the recent MAGA effort to overturn the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=486.5s)]
*  loss of then outgoing President Trump in 2020. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=493.12s)]
*  American leader McConnell called that effort a violent insurrection. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  And in court, it rather infamously led to sedition convictions, which this president, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=501.79999999999995s)]
*  the beneficiary of that effort, later pardoned on his very first day in office. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=508.38s)]
*  The New York Times notes that when violent protests originate from the right, Trump has [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=513.68s)]
*  chosen to downplay the violence or suggest the protesters have a noble cause. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=517.6s)]
*  When it comes from whatever he deems the left, Trump expresses open desire for law enforcement [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=522.36s)]
*  and the military to harshly crack down on them. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=527.72s)]
*  And so what we're witnessing right now is the extension of this upside down land. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=532.0400000000001s)]
*  In other words, it is an insurrection that would justify only under our legal history [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  this kind of exception. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=545.0s)]
*  And the last time we had an insurrection, you may recall, President was Trump leaving [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=548.0s)]
*  office. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=551.96s)]
*  At one time, he appeared to welcome court praise and later pardon those violent and [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=552.96s)]
*  horrific attacks on police, while now he wants to use the rhetoric and the language of law [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=558.64s)]
*  and order as if anyone would believe it who lived through that now convicted sedition. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=563.44s)]
*  Donald Trump is saying he doesn't like it when they do bad things to police and even [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=582.96s)]
*  an act like spitting will be met with hitting. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=595.72s)]
*  But of course, it was a lot of hitting of police that he formally embraced and condoned. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=599.08s)]
*  People who'd been convicted of attacks on police were let out of jail very early, let [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=604.98s)]
*  out of prison very early because he said, it's all good. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=609.68s)]
*  And that has to be relevant here when, A, you have legal claims involving the exception [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  of insurrection and B, a country looking up and saying, what is this all about? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=619.62s)]
*  Is this really about public safety and order? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=625.12s)]
*  Is this even really about immigration? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=627.04s)]
*  Or is it about an obvious proven double standard of a sitting president who has embraced some [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=629.2399999999999s)]
*  people who attack police while then turning around and claiming he's concerned about that [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=634.56s)]
*  very thing. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=638.36s)]
*  Now, the use of the Marines is extremely rare. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=639.36s)]
*  Governor Newsom vowing a suit over this deployment, saying it's a blatant abuse of power, which [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=642.88s)]
*  he posted online. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=648.48s)]
*  Under law, it's very clear. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=650.36s)]
*  You need an actual rebellion. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=653.5s)]
*  We're talking about a military level challenge to the government. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=655.44s)]
*  Think civil war or violent ongoing organized insurrection. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=659.22s)]
*  The AP notes that officials have scrambled to even establish new rules to guide the U.S. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=663.2s)]
*  Marines in how to patrol citizens because, as I just told you, it's not something they [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=668.64s)]
*  even normally are supposed to do. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=673.36s)]
*  So they don't have a bunch of rules for it because they don't patrol American streets. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=674.76s)]
*  There are documents that say warning shots would be prohibited, troops would be directed [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=679.32s)]
*  to de-escalate, but they could also act in self-defense, the documents say. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=683.2s)]
*  And so the question is, why are we making up these rules on the fly? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=688.92s)]
*  And does it sound like a good idea to thrust Marines who were recruited and trained to [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=693.4s)]
*  go patrol abroad to now figure out when and how to shoot Americans in, quote, self-defense? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtbuW8EnTQ&t=697.8s)]
