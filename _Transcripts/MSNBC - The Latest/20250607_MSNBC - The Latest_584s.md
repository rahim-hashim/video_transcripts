# Musk has been ‘more of nuisance than anything’ to Republicans: Fmr. Republican advisor
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A)
*  Well, joining me now, New York Times reporter and MSNBC contributor Teddy Schleifer, along [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=0.0s)]
*  with Megan Hayes, former special assistant to President Biden, and Laura Gillespie, former [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=4.72s)]
*  advisor to former speaker John Boehner. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  It's good to see all three of you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=11.48s)]
*  Teddy, you first here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=12.48s)]
*  Where do things stand right now? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=14.08s)]
*  I mean, Musk has, he's backed off of a threat to decommission SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=15.8s)]
*  but your paper and NBC, among others, reports that Trump is considering selling the red [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=21.76s)]
*  Tesla that he bought in March at that flashy White House lawn event we all witnessed. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=27.2s)]
*  Are we headed towards a reconciliation or estrangement? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=32.28s)]
*  Well, I thought the most interesting move today was Elon Musk deleting these most, probably [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=34.68s)]
*  his worst tweets about Trump, where he ties him to Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=39.44s)]
*  Elon Musk and his Twitter deletions, you could write a PhD on kind of how that's done, but [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=44.68s)]
*  it's not done casually. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  You know, many of us have sent a message we want to take back, and obviously there's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=52.76s)]
*  some indication that Elon feels that way about these Epstein tweets. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=57.88s)]
*  I don't know if it's a truce or if it's just like a cooling of tensions. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=61.72s)]
*  You can choose your wording, but I thought that was the most revealing window into his [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=64.92s)]
*  state of mind, which is he's going back to a message he sent a couple of days ago and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=69.36s)]
*  deleting it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  He's not recanting it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  He's not apologizing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  He's not putting out a press release that he deleted it, but he is very aware of his [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  He's very aware that things like that will get coverage and shows it intentionally. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=79.6s)]
*  But he has also liked a couple tweets, or whatever you want to call them, exes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=85.2s)]
*  I'm not sure I even refer to them. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=89.76s)]
*  He has people who've said, oh, you need to reveal everything from the Epstein files and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=91.12s)]
*  put out lists and all that kind of thing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=95.08s)]
*  Let me ask you what we heard there in that soundbite with regard to government contracts. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=97.0s)]
*  What's the status of that? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=101.84s)]
*  Where does that stand? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=103.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think everything's on the table. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=105.48s)]
*  I mean, clearly, this is obviously an evolving situation. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of steps in between Russ vote saying that's on the table and Donald [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=110.72s)]
*  Trump saying it's on the table and it actually happening. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  I don't even know how that even would be done, frankly, in any kind of effective way. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=119.0s)]
*  Excuse me. Clearly, there's an effort to get something. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=125.84s)]
*  You know, they're keeping the option on the table. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=130.08s)]
*  And I understand why. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=131.84s)]
*  So, Megan, to you now, because Musk has made numerous threats about the information that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=134.08s)]
*  he could release. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=138.72s)]
*  He has had unprecedented access to Trump and the administration. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=139.72000000000003s)]
*  So there is a potential for damage if he were to talk. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=146.68s)]
*  However, as the Guardian points out, members of Trump's inner circle, they're going to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=147.68s)]
*  have the same access to Musk, whose personal life is becoming a media staple. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  So are the headlines of mutually assured destruction correct? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=156.24s)]
*  And just, you know, digging into what you've done for a living from a messaging standpoint, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=161.2s)]
*  how nervous would you be if you were still in the White House? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=166.0s)]
*  I mean, this is not this is not healthy at all for anybody. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=169.56s)]
*  It's not healthy for the American people. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  This is a massive distraction. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=173.56s)]
*  And I think that it's unclear whether Trump wants this distraction to distract away from [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=175.0s)]
*  this terrible bill that's going through Congress right now, or if this is something that he [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=179.16s)]
*  actually wants to put an end to and to move on to talk about something else. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=182.72s)]
*  But this is a massive distraction that I assume that the Musk team and Trump's team are [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=185.76s)]
*  very cautious of and very aware that this could be just could keep going on and on. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=190.28s)]
*  And it's all the media is covering. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=196.32s)]
*  And that's taking away from his agenda. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  It's going to take away from his parade next Saturday. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=199.04s)]
*  There's just a lot of downside for him to keep this going. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  So, Maura, among Musk's tirades was his claim, quote, without me, Trump would have lost [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=203.68s)]
*  the election. Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51 49 in the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=209.68s)]
*  Senate. Now, I mean, whether he can actually take credit can be debated. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=213.76s)]
*  But Musk did flood more than two hundred and fifty million dollars into the race. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=216.92s)]
*  He intended to give another 100 million to Trump's political operation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=221.11999999999998s)]
*  So what happens if he doesn't and he directs, oh, let's save the money instead to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  defeating MAGA endorsed candidates? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=228.56s)]
*  It'll be interesting to watch it play out. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  I think that, you know, Elon Musk did not understand how government worked, especially [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=233.32s)]
*  government, you know, ours, and that we saw kind of an egregious way because he came in [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=237.2s)]
*  and tried slashing things. And that'll still be debated in the courts. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=242.8s)]
*  He just didn't understand bureaucracy and things don't operate the way that he probably [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  would like for businesses to operate. Right. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=251.0s)]
*  There's a separation there for a reason. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  And I just I think when it comes to elections, you know, the House Republicans and Senate [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=254.84s)]
*  Republicans, by and large, are going to stand behind President Trump. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=259.12s)]
*  Right. They're more short term thinking as far as we've got to get through this bill. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=261.64s)]
*  We've got to pass the president's agenda there on the same team. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  Elon came in at the last minute, essentially, with this election and through his support [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=268.12s)]
*  behind President Trump, it really has been more of a nuisance than anything. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=271.8s)]
*  And so, you know, if Democrats want to take his money and that's their decision. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=275.08s)]
*  But I just think that moving forward, Republicans are pretty, you know, OK with the fact [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=279.16s)]
*  that Elon's out. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  Teddy, what about the risk of investigations into Musk? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  Steve Bannon, of course, a fierce critic of Musk, is calling for because we saw recent [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=288.56s)]
*  reports of allegedly excessive drug use by Musk during last year's campaign that could [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=292.16s)]
*  warrant probes, plus allegations that Musk initially didn't have a legal basis to live [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=297.64s)]
*  and work here in the U.S., which then puts his immigration status at risk. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  Is there any appetite in Trump world to take this on? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=305.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we reported yesterday that Trump has been sort of asking people, perhaps [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=309.96s)]
*  idly, perhaps not idly, whether or not Musk is doing drugs right now and he must be acting [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=313.2s)]
*  out so unstably because, you know, he's on drugs. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=318.44s)]
*  I mean, that's I'm not saying that's true. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=322.36s)]
*  I'm saying that's what Trump is saying. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=323.36s)]
*  Clearly, there are vulnerabilities, to say the least, you know, obviously, given the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=325.35999999999996s)]
*  amount of federal contracts, there's the opportunity for retribution. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  But, you know, Trump is vindictive and a lot of things are on the table. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=333.56s)]
*  Right. You never know. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=337.64s)]
*  Like, I can't give you an answer to say that he wouldn't do it because Trump does a lot [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  of stuff. But clearly, there are vulnerabilities and there are there is the, you know, Musk's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=344.56s)]
*  kind of sorted chaotic personal life is an opportunity for Trump to frankly screw with [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=351.16s)]
*  him if he would like to. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=357.44s)]
*  So, Megan, even Russia has weighed in on this. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  There's one official who joked about hosting peace talks. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=361.72s)]
*  Another offered for Musk to come work over there. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=364.56s)]
*  Are U.S. adversaries pouncing on this upheaval or a perceived weakness here somehow? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=367.6s)]
*  I mean, they have every right to. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=375.16s)]
*  This is a joke, right? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  These two billionaires are having a fight publicly on social media platforms over who can [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  line each other's pockets more. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=381.6s)]
*  I mean, it's just disgusting that we're even having to deal with this. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=382.88000000000005s)]
*  But it's more embarrassing to our country that our adversaries are now weighing in. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  But this is also creating a vulnerability for them. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=388.8s)]
*  This is they see weakness and they see how to get under Trump's skin. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=390.6s)]
*  They see a way in. And I think that we should be cautious of that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=393.72s)]
*  And I think that they'll take full advantage of that, whether it's covertly or very out in [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=396.12s)]
*  the open like that that comment that you just posted on the on the screen. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=401.0s)]
*  Hmm. Samara, House Republicans, we saw them scrambling to mollify Musk after speaking [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=403.96s)]
*  out about the mega policy bill. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=409.88s)]
*  But with Trump and Musk in a full on feud, where does that leave these lawmakers? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=412.2s)]
*  Do they flip again? Do they then attack Musk? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=416.96s)]
*  The sad reality is that hypocrisy runs rampant in politics, right? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=421.0s)]
*  So we're not, you know, novices to that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=424.76s)]
*  We've seen that play out many times, but on both sides of the aisle, you know, you're [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=427.52s)]
*  seeing with the attack as the Democrats have been placing, you know, putting Trump and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=430.03999999999996s)]
*  Elon together as buddy buddies, you know, do those ads need to be recut now because [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=433.08s)]
*  they want to champion what Elon is saying against the bill? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=436.47999999999996s)]
*  It's just this is part of the game, unfortunately, and it's not a pretty side of it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  To Megan's point, it is quite embarrassing not only here in the United States, but also [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=442.91999999999996s)]
*  on the world stage. But I think for Republicans, they need to look at, OK, what is it that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=446.36s)]
*  we need to get done? Taking away going above the fray, which has been hard to find with [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=450.2s)]
*  many of the members of the House and the Senate. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=455.24s)]
*  But it's that time is to move above the fray. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=457.08s)]
*  And remember, again, this shouldn't be surprising. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=459.64s)]
*  Donald Trump has been who he has been. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=462.12s)]
*  Elon should not have been surprised. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=463.76s)]
*  Donald Trump has said from day one he wanted to tear up. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=465.48s)]
*  He has been pretty much himself from the get go. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=467.92s)]
*  And so everyone who has turned against him, whether from former officials and Elon Musk, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=470.04s)]
*  it's on them, not on Trump. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=474.68s)]
*  He has been who he has been. And they chose whether they saw an opportunity for themselves [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=476.04s)]
*  and they didn't play out how they liked it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=479.68s)]
*  So, you know, I think that's really what we're watching play out here is with him, with [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=481.12s)]
*  Elon Musk and with others. So Republicans need to decide where they stand. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=484.92s)]
*  And I think for a large for a large portion of them, they'll stand beside the president. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  And so, Teddy, where does all this leave the negotiations on the Republican mega bill? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=491.16s)]
*  Well, looks like Elon Musk is about to get a real close up glimpse or a real test of [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=496.56s)]
*  his influence. I mean, people can recall, remember, when there was kind of the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=502.32s)]
*  negotiation last December, you know, Musk almost did torpedo the bill. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=505.92s)]
*  Right. And and and there is an opportunity for Musk to kind of turn a new leaf. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=509.12s)]
*  And then maybe, you know, he'll say that, you know, if there are some improvements made [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=514.56s)]
*  on the Senate side of the bill, that maybe everything is fine. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=518.08s)]
*  Right. And that is sort of kind of the maybe Pollyanna's view of this is that basically [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=521.12s)]
*  Elon will extract a few concessions and he'll bless it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=526.1600000000001s)]
*  And then it's Kumbaya and everybody goes home happy. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=529.6s)]
*  You know, I was struck last week that over the past week that there were very few Republicans [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=533.08s)]
*  willing to kind of side with Musk over Trump. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=537.9200000000001s)]
*  And I am not getting the sense based on our reporting that that Elon has the influence [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=541.36s)]
*  at least on Capitol Hill that he thinks he does. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=548.12s)]
*  And, you know, Mike Johnson has done a very good job, obviously, of keeping his [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=551.2s)]
*  conference in line. And Trump will continue to kind of ride, hopefully, that [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=554.9200000000001s)]
*  unanimity that he's seen in Capitol Hill to a passage of signature. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrOXzlTnF8A&t=559.32s)]
