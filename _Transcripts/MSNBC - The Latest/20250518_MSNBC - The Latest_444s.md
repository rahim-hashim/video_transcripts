# Trump’s approval numbers are sinking. Do Republicans have the ‘charisma’ to overcome it?
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs)
*  New today, a Wall Street Journal analysis finds the coalition that propelled President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump to victory is falling apart. An aggregate of polling shows the groups that swung toward [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=5.32s)]
*  Trump in 2024, including young and non-white voters, are now souring over his handling [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=11.16s)]
*  of the economy. Here's what lawmakers from both sides said today about Trump's responsibility. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=17.36s)]
*  There's just no doubt that it was Donald Trump who added more to the deficit than any president [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=24.2s)]
*  in the history of the country, and he is on pace to do it for a second time. It's going [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=28.28s)]
*  to crater the economy, and listen, it won't have an impact on his billionaire friends. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=31.92s)]
*  His Mar-a-Lago crowd will come out all right. We have gotten rich, rich, rich off of trade, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=36.24s)]
*  all Americans, and it is lifting all boats, and we are richer than we have ever been in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=41.6s)]
*  any time in our history, but it's not easy to convince people of that because there are [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=46.52s)]
*  short-term problems where you have inflation, like during the last four years, where the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=50.44s)]
*  did lose purchasing power and did get poorer. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=55.8s)]
*  And back with me, Shaniqua McClendon and Carlos Cabello. Thank you guys for sticking around. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=59.44s)]
*  So, Shaniqua, the WSJ finds that Trump's approval ratings have declined across all demographics, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=63.31999999999999s)]
*  even among his most ardent supporters, and after he made gains among black, Hispanic, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  young voters in the November election. Do you attribute this mostly to Trump's lower [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=75.52s)]
*  marks on handling the economy, and can he reverse this anytime soon as his tariffs are [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=80.56s)]
*  taking effect? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=86.2s)]
*  Yeah, I do attribute this to, I won't call it work, I don't know, the decimation that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=87.2s)]
*  he's put in place for the economy. A lot of people who voted for Donald Trump, especially [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=93.64s)]
*  some of the new people we saw vote for Donald Trump, are not pleased. They are not better [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=99.44s)]
*  off. He said on day one he was going to fix the economy, and on top of that, we have three [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  and a half more years for that to all sink in for folks, and they're not going to see things [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  get better. So I think people will continue to be disappointed. But I think who this is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  really a problem for is not Donald Trump. It's congressional Republicans in the House and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=116.04s)]
*  Senate who are going to have to go up for reelection in 2026 and 2028. And Donald Trump [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  had a certain amount of appeal for these voters to come out, and he's not going to be on the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=124.92s)]
*  ballot anymore. So I think they're going to have to carry the brunt of this, but also [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=128.6s)]
*  not have the charisma to get them out. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=133.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, Carlos, the analysis finds that white men without a four-year college degree, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=135.56s)]
*  they're the only group who support for Trump remains strong. Is there a time for Trump to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=140.6s)]
*  change voters initial and often, you know, stunning impressions of his presidency? Does a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  Republican candidate in 2028 even have a chance of winning, to Shaniqua's point, without the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=151.04s)]
*  coalition that Trump put together? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=156.2s)]
*  Well, no, Alex, without the Trump voters, it will be difficult for Republicans in swing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=157.8s)]
*  districts and swing states to keep their seats. Now, the interesting part of all of this is [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=165.28s)]
*  that a lot of the issues that Donald Trump has had, the reason why some of these people who [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=170.52s)]
*  joined his coalition are now frustrated, these are self-inflicted wounds. And Senator Paul put [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=176.12s)]
*  his finger on it in his statement that you just ran. This tariff experiment, number one, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=181.76s)]
*  it meant that Donald Trump was taking full ownership of the economy, an economy that he [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  had criticized just a few months before as a candidate. And number two, the tariff experiment [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=192.67999999999998s)]
*  was destabilizing, and it introduced a lot of uncertainty into the economy. Now, he can [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=197.88s)]
*  fix this. He could reverse all of this, but it doesn't seem like he's willing to do that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  OK, let's switch gears, Shaniqua, because the Trump administration is investigating former FBI [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  Director James Comey over that social media post of seashells on the beach, forming the numbers [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=214.11999999999998s)]
*  86, 47. 86 can mean get rid of, 47, of course, or 47, the president. Administration officials [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=218.92s)]
*  accuse Comey of calling for Trump's assassination and saying he should be jailed. Give me your [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=226.2s)]
*  take on whether you think it's another example of Trump retribution. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=231.32s)]
*  It absolutely is. I mean, the funny thing is there was so many times in the past that James [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=236.12s)]
*  Comey could have been helpful. And now he's, you know, making these cryptic posts. I don't [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=240.92s)]
*  think he meant he wanted the president to be assassinated. This is a former FBI director who [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  I think would take that very seriously. But I do think he's also taking really seriously all of [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=251.0s)]
*  the corruption that is happening in the White House right now. And he's saying we need to get [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=255.24s)]
*  rid of Donald Trump, probably through impeachment, not, you know, assassination. But I think we're [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=258.84s)]
*  seeing what Donald Trump does all the time. If you are not on his side or if you are not enabling [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=264.44s)]
*  him the way we see a lot of congressional Republicans do, he will come after you. And so I think [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=269.0s)]
*  that's what this is really about. What do you believe, Carlos, that Comey meant posting this [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=273.24s)]
*  photo? And regardless, isn't it his First Amendment right to voice antipathy for the president? I mean, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=278.36s)]
*  is the administration effectively attempting to criminalize free speech? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  Alex, I think that James Comey is a man who really enjoys getting attention. And that's what first [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=287.32s)]
*  got him in trouble when he did that unprecedented, held that unprecedented press conference about [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=295.48s)]
*  the Hillary Clinton case. He's a man who enjoys being in the news, calling attention to himself [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=301.08s)]
*  on social media. And it appears here that he went too far. Do I think he should be imprisoned or [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=307.32s)]
*  charged? No. But should he be questioned like any other American who makes a suggestive [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=313.08s)]
*  comment about hurting a public official or attacking a public official? Sure, he should [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=318.76s)]
*  be questioned and he should have due process and he should have a right to a lawyer and all of that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=324.04s)]
*  But at the end of the day, James Comey's thirst for attention is what's getting him in trouble. And [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=329.0s)]
*  I don't think it does anything to contribute to the public discourse in our country. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=334.92s)]
*  Oh, his Hillary Clinton press conference in 2016. What was that, like 10 days before the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=339.32s)]
*  election? Anyway, quickly to you, Shaniqua. This week, Walmart announcing it will soon raise prices [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=343.72s)]
*  as a result of Trump's tariffs. The president responded saying, Walmart aid billions last year. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  It should, quote, eat the tariffs. Walmart says 90% of American households rely on it for a range [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=353.56s)]
*  of products. So big picture. Is this a battle that Trump can win in the eyes of the public? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=359.32s)]
*  Absolutely not. You know, I grew up in a low income household and we grocery [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=363.24s)]
*  shopped and got a lot of things from Walmart. And I can't imagine what it would have done to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=369.0s)]
*  our household if those prices had gone up. And I know what my mother would have thought if those [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=373.0s)]
*  prices had gone up because the president just decided it was a good idea. You know, Walmart [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=377.64s)]
*  has said that they will eat some of these tariffs for a bit, but I don't think that's going to last [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=381.8s)]
*  long. They are a private company who have shareholders and they have to be, you know, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=385.08s)]
*  responsible to them. And at the end of the day, you know, their job is to make money and they're [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=388.84s)]
*  not going to be able to do that if they are picking up his slack for making poor decisions. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=393.56s)]
*  Last word to you, Carlos on Walmart versus Trump. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=397.32s)]
*  For all of my Republican friends who have bashed socialism, myself included for a very long time, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=401.08s)]
*  an American president telling a company what kind of pricing they should set, how much money they [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=407.64s)]
*  should make, how much in profits they should deliver their shareholders. There's no place [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=413.96s)]
*  for that in America, Alex. Okay. Shaniqua and Carlos, I'll see you again next week and I hope. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=418.76s)]
*  Thank you much. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z3e_P6-bs&t=422.91999999999996s)]
