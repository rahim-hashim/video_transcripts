# Sen. Kaine: Democrats are going to fight Trump's megabill 'tooth and nail'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs)
*  And joining us now is Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a member of the budget and the foreign relations committees. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=3.68s)]
*  Thank you, Senator, for taking the time. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Let's start there with the budget. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=9.0s)]
*  Trump's big, beautiful bill cuts $880 billion in Medicaid funding. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=10.52s)]
*  What the Trump administration claims is waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=15.84s)]
*  Notably, it would also add work requirements for recipients, and it bars undocumented immigrants, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=18.84s)]
*  they say, from getting coverage. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=23.16s)]
*  Explain your concerns about these provisions specifically. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think this big, sick bill, the Medicaid cuts, are going to be one of the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=28.2s)]
*  real flashpoints. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=32.8s)]
*  The Republicans say they want to add work requirements. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=34.6s)]
*  Anna, who gets Medicaid? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=36.72s)]
*  Huge percentage of Medicaid recipients are children, disabled children who use Medicaid [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=38.72s)]
*  to get the wheelchair they need to attend school. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Our parents and grandparents in nursing homes, pregnant moms, more than 50 percent of births [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=47.84s)]
*  in this country are compensated by Medicaid because the mom is low income. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=53.44s)]
*  So what? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=58.68s)]
*  We're going to put children and seniors in nursing homes and moms on the verge of delivery. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=59.68s)]
*  We're going to impose work requirements on them. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=64.8s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=66.32s)]
*  And then who's left in Medicaid? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=67.32s)]
*  It's disabled adults. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=68.52s)]
*  We're going to make them undergo a work requirement. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=71.44s)]
*  The estimates are this will remove millions of people from the Medicaid rolls. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=73.6s)]
*  Democrats are going to fight this tooth and nail. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=78.32s)]
*  And let me just follow up because the White House keeps pushing this line that undocumented [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=80.84s)]
*  immigrants shouldn't get Medicaid coverage paid for by the American people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=84.56s)]
*  And they're saying that's some of what's going to be saved here. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  Do you disagree with that thinking? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=90.92s)]
*  I don't disagree with that thinking, except that they're lying that that is who is going [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=94.48s)]
*  to get hurt by these Medicaid cuts. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=99.44000000000001s)]
*  The people who are going to be hurt by Medicaid cuts are not undocumented immigrants. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=102.62s)]
*  It's American citizens who are children, pregnant moms, seniors in nursing homes and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=107.04s)]
*  disabled adults. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to make sure for many of these, this is a life and death matter. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=113.2s)]
*  And we're going to make sure that they're protected, do all we can to eliminate these [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=117.44000000000001s)]
*  Medicaid cuts. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=121.56s)]
*  Can you just clarify for our viewers though, do undocumented immigrants get Medicaid coverage? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  I am unaware of that in Virginia. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=128.56s)]
*  I represent Virginia. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=131.24s)]
*  I'm unaware of it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=133.0s)]
*  But I do know who gets Medicaid coverage because I travel all around Virginia and I go to meetings [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=134.48s)]
*  with citizens where they are deeply, deeply worried about these Medicaid cuts. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=139.28s)]
*  Remember, Anna, they tried to do the same thing in 2017. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  When they voted to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, they went farther and tried to eliminate [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=147.64s)]
*  or dramatically cut Medicaid. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=153.48s)]
*  And the halls of the Senate were filled with people receiving Medicaid, American citizens [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=155.83999999999997s)]
*  who are going to get hurt, including the little lobbyists, children in wheelchairs who came [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=161.92s)]
*  to our offices and said, do not take away my wheelchair. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  It's what I need to go to school every day. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=171.64s)]
*  We're going to see the same thing happen if the Republicans persist in this Medicaid cut [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  effort. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=178.11999999999998s)]
*  This bill would also cut SNAP benefits by roughly 300 billion by 2034. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=179.11999999999998s)]
*  We know that you're against that provision, but how do you communicate to voters that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  your party can remedy this situation? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=190.92s)]
*  There's this new CNN poll that finds just 19 percent of voters believe Democrats can [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=193.92s)]
*  get things done. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=198.16s)]
*  Well, we have to prevail on this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=199.72s)]
*  I'll give you a let's use SNAP as an example. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  About 800,000 Virginians receive SNAP benefits. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  That's nearly one in 10 Virginians. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=208.28s)]
*  If the House plan were to pass 200,000, one quarter of them would lose their SNAP benefits. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=210.24s)]
*  What is a SNAP benefit? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  How much do you get a day? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=218.7s)]
*  I met with a group of SNAP recipients yesterday in Virginia. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=219.8s)]
*  They get about $4.50 a day to feed themselves. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=223.36s)]
*  That's what a SNAP benefit is. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=230.32000000000002s)]
*  And wait, we're going to cut that? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=231.96s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  And so look, we just have to communicate to the public what this program is. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=234.96s)]
*  And it's not only about the recipients. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=239.28s)]
*  It's about the farmers who grow the food that go into the SNAP program. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  It's about the grocers. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=245.36s)]
*  The National Grocery Association says the House SNAP cuts will cost 17,000 jobs in the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=246.94s)]
*  grocery sector. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=253.42s)]
*  So we've got to do a good job of communicating this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=255.04s)]
*  But I think we're going to be able to because, as you know, this reconciliation process ends [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=258.84s)]
*  up with a series of amendment votes where we can make it real clear. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=263.3s)]
*  Do you want to cut that much out of SNAP at the same time as you're deepening the estate [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=268.26s)]
*  tax giveaway you give to the wealthiest? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=273.22s)]
*  If you take away the estate tax giveaway, you don't have to cut SNAP at all. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=276.02000000000004s)]
*  And we will be posing very stark choices like that that the American public can see. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=280.22s)]
*  And I know which side of this question the American public is going to be on. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=285.3s)]
*  Senator, in that same CNN poll I just referenced, just 16% of people believe the Democratic [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=288.98s)]
*  Party has strong leaders compared to 40% who say that about the GOP. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=295.14000000000004s)]
*  If you're to look inward, why is that? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  What do Democrats need to do differently? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=303.14s)]
*  Well, let me look inward and tell you, I represent a state that 20 years ago everything was Republican. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=306.14s)]
*  We hadn't gone Democratic in a presidential election since 1964. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=312.74s)]
*  And since 2008, we've gone five in a row for Democratic candidates. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=317.14s)]
*  We win two out of three statewide elections. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=321.2s)]
*  Both U.S. senators are Democrats. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=323.62s)]
*  We have a Democratic majority in both of our houses. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=325.7s)]
*  We're not a blue state. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=328.26s)]
*  We do have a Republican governor, although we're going to remedy that in November. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=329.26s)]
*  I keep trying to convince my colleagues, if you want to understand what we need to do [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=332.78s)]
*  as a party, why don't you look at the two states that have had the biggest red to blue [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=336.26s)]
*  turnaround in America in the last 20 years, Colorado and Virginia. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=340.9s)]
*  We do it in Virginia by being economy first, we're make, build, grow people. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=344.78s)]
*  We beat the Republicans on the economy, and then we already have people's trust on everything [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=349.94s)]
*  else. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=353.97999999999996s)]
*  And that's what the Democratic Party needs to do nationally. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=354.97999999999996s)]
*  One thing Republicans seem to use as a tactic to project strength is don't admit mistakes. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=357.56s)]
*  Don't show any weakness. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=363.68s)]
*  Double down, triple down. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=364.68s)]
*  For example, your GOP colleague, Senator Joni Ernst, she's responding this way after her [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=366.6s)]
*  controversial Medicaid comments. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=371.36s)]
*  Take a listen to her remarks over the past few days. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=373.2s)]
*  They are not eligible, so they will be coming off. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=377.24s)]
*  So we people are not well, we all are going to die. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=381.76s)]
*  So for heaven sakes, I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=388.36s)]
*  that yes, we are all going to perish from this earth. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=399.08s)]
*  So I apologize. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=406.16s)]
*  And I'm really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=408.04s)]
*  fairy as well. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=413.44s)]
*  I'm very compassionate and you need to listen to the entire conversation. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=414.44s)]
*  Can you explain how to protect the most vulnerable? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=419.44000000000005s)]
*  I just want to make sure viewers know that very first video was from the town hall, the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=424.52000000000004s)]
*  initial comments she made when she was being questioned about Medicaid cuts and she made [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  those initial comments and since has continued to defend those comments. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=432.72s)]
*  You've worked with Senator Ernst on bipartisan legislation in the past. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=436.6s)]
*  We have this behavior you're seeing surprised you. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=440.20000000000005s)]
*  Look, I think I do think the Republicans are very vulnerable over these Medicaid cuts and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=444.92s)]
*  Donald Trump wants him to cut Medicaid, so they're having a hard time, you know, making [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=450.12s)]
*  the counterargument. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=454.44000000000005s)]
*  But I would just remind all of my colleagues, you tried to do this in 2017 and you got your [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=455.48s)]
*  head handed to you on a platter, both in terms of the ACA vote in August, but then [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycXyP7IWPs&t=461.8s)]
