# National Guard continues to face off against protestors for fourth day
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg)
*  that we're seeing right now. We're in front of the federal building here in Los Angeles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=0.0s)]
*  And you can see this is the National Guard. These are the National Guard soldiers that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=4.8s)]
*  have been stationed here since we believe last night. There's a big federal building [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=8.22s)]
*  on the other side is this holding facility, the MDC. That's where, if you are taken into [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=11.96s)]
*  custody by ICE, that's where you're processed. But you can see this crowd. Let me walk this [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=17.54s)]
*  way. You've got a crowd that's starting to gather here. This is Temple and Los Angeles. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=22.2s)]
*  They are standing here looking at the California National Guard. This is the California National [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=27.92s)]
*  Guard contingent, not the ones that we are told are going to be coming from. They're [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=33.72s)]
*  going to be coming from 29 Palms. This is the National Guard contingent that has been [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=39.72s)]
*  here since yesterday. But you see that they are having to face off with the protesters [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=44.68000000000001s)]
*  that are down here. Many of these protesters have been yelling at them for quite some time. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=51.24s)]
*  So far, things have been relatively peaceful. Some music over here. So we're going to walk [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  this way. But right now, the crowd is maybe 200, 300 protesters. This particular location, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=60.68s)]
*  there's another group of protesters, maybe 100 protesters, 200 protesters that are also [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=69.48s)]
*  facing off at LAPD. But as we understand it, this is a federal building. Again, on the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=74.64s)]
*  other side is MDC. From what we've seen, it's been very difficult for LAPD or for federal [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=79.58s)]
*  authorities to come back and resupply the soldiers that are here protecting the front [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=86.18s)]
*  and the soldiers that are on the backside protecting the Sally Port that we saw yesterday. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=92.78s)]
*  But this is the scene that we see right now. So far, everything has been peaceful. We saw [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=97.42s)]
*  some faith leaders right here trying to keep the temperature down. But right now, this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=102.62s)]
*  is the scene as more and more people show up to this protest. And I don't have IFB. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=108.26s)]
*  I can't hear you. So I'm going to send it back to you, Nicole. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=113.46s)]
*  That's our Gaudi Schwartz live for us in Los Angeles. We thank him for that report. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2TJXD_LGg&t=116.82s)]
