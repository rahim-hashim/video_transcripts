# ‘This is political fairy smut’: Biden’s granddaughter slams new book on his mental decline
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8)
*  While we are mired in the reality of President Trump's second administration, a new book [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=0.0s)]
*  raises questions about the previous administration and what those questions mean for the future [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=4.76s)]
*  of the Democratic Party. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=9.88s)]
*  In Original Sin, President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=11.84s)]
*  Run Again, CNN's Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson of Axios reveal how the Biden White House [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=17.12s)]
*  went to great lengths to conceal the extent of President Biden's physical and mental deterioration [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=24.48s)]
*  and how it contributed to dooming Democrats' chances of beating Donald Trump. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=30.68s)]
*  Joining us now is one of the authors of that book, Alex Thompson, national political correspondent [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=36.08s)]
*  for Axios. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=41.68s)]
*  Alex, as someone who also had a book come out on May 20th, I'll say congratulations. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=42.68s)]
*  Alex, a serious question, and this is the thing that really gets me. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=49.96s)]
*  Why should people who are watching this show right now, who are worried about the state [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  of our democracy, look at this book as something that's important for them to read and understand? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=61.08s)]
*  Because I think the whole conceit of this entire book was, why did Trump win? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  And when we were asking that question, we were looking back, and sort of the thesis [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=72.72s)]
*  of the book is the most consequential moment of the entire 2024 election was the moment [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=76.68s)]
*  when Joe Biden decided to run for reelection and the Democratic Party sort of sleepwalking [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=82.2s)]
*  to the point of that crucial June debate. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=86.84s)]
*  And so really the book is like looking back at how the party got itself to this point [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=90.64000000000001s)]
*  now where they allowed, in part, Donald Trump had something to do with it, but in some ways [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=95.56s)]
*  that he's the book is the party also allowed him to come back. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=101.12s)]
*  So for any Democrat watching and thinking, you know, Joe Biden, you know, he's in the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=104.44s)]
*  past, this isn't just a book about Joe Biden. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=109.16s)]
*  It's a book about the Democratic Party. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=111.24s)]
*  One of the things that is throughout the book, right, is, and that we were looking for when [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=113.32s)]
*  I was reading it, because you guys talk about it as a cover up, and people have asked, where [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=119.16s)]
*  is the cover up, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=122.92s)]
*  And I guess my biggest question, or the thing that it feels like it's less of a cover up [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=124.53999999999999s)]
*  but more of, you have this team of people, you guys call them, the people call them the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=128.8s)]
*  Politburo, who have been around Donald Trump, Joe Biden for a really long time. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=133.04s)]
*  And they seem, I was talking to a former Biden campaign official, to have not served the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=138.92s)]
*  president well. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=143.64s)]
*  Is that what we're talking about here? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=144.68s)]
*  I think both things can be true. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  The reason we call it a cover up is because millions and millions of people were shocked [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=147.56s)]
*  by the debate performance that Biden had. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=152.06s)]
*  And I think the book very conclusively shows that it is not the first time that Joe Biden [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=154.84s)]
*  was acting like that behind the scenes. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  And that there were steps taken by the Politburo, by the people around Joe Biden to shield him, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  not just from the public, not just from his own cabinet, but from other members of the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=167.32s)]
*  Democratic Party. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=171.84s)]
*  The reason we call it a cover up, I know sometimes it's insinuated that cover up means a crime. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=172.84s)]
*  That's not what we mean here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=176.60000000000002s)]
*  We mean that they were intentionally trying to hide how at times adult he was from the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=178.0s)]
*  public. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=183.24s)]
*  Now, to your point about, you know, did the people around him serve him well? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=184.24s)]
*  Well, clearly not, given that he was basically ousted from the nomination at the 11th hour. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=188.28s)]
*  And they basically led him to a point when, you know, I don't know how anyone, and I know [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=195.24s)]
*  there's a lot of rage from people that have been with Biden for a long time that love [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  him. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=204.44s)]
*  There's a lot of rage at that inner circle for allowing him to go on that, to allow him [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=205.44s)]
*  to go on that debate stage and sully his legacy, knowing that there was even a 10 percent chance [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=210.5s)]
*  that he would act like that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=216.0s)]
*  I don't disagree with the phrase cover up because you look at all these steps, calculated [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  measures that were taken to shield Biden from people with who worked from him from public [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=223.12s)]
*  view, given the number of interviews that he did not do compared to predecessors, the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=228.68s)]
*  number of press conference, the cabinet members. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  Let's look at this quote from cabinet secretaries. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=236.24s)]
*  And I found that to be some of the most powerful reporting and fact pattern that you laid out [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=238.4s)]
*  just because so many cabinet secretaries just said they didn't know what was going on. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  And so they said, you know, over 2023 and 2024, the circle of people with access to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=248.11999999999998s)]
*  the president grew smaller and smaller. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=255.23999999999998s)]
*  Even the majority of Biden's cabinet members weren't in it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=257.58s)]
*  And so then when Biden also needed support from Democratic congressional members, they [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=261.2s)]
*  told you, they were saying, we haven't seen him, we haven't talked to him in a year. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=266.14s)]
*  Talk about what it was like getting sources to open up about their lack of access. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=270.72s)]
*  Well, and almost all the interviews done was after November 5th. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=275.6s)]
*  So, you know, there were people that I had been reaching out to sliding through DMs for [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=279.44s)]
*  four years and they finally decided to talk. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=284.16s)]
*  There were also people that I talked to in the past that weren't really candid and finally [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=286.56s)]
*  felt they could be candid. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=291.04s)]
*  And to give them the benefit of the doubt, I think a lot of them were scared because [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=293.0s)]
*  they felt that if they spoke out, it wasn't going to get Joe Biden out of the race and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=297.24s)]
*  also was only going to help Donald Trump. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=301.72s)]
*  So, you know, cabinet members, senior White House officials and to your point, you know, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=303.8s)]
*  about the restricting access, I remember one that just comes to mind is, you know, one [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=308.24s)]
*  person basically, whenever like the White House press team wanted to put someone on [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=312.92s)]
*  the phone with a reporter saying, Joe Biden's great, Joe Biden's fine. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=317.48s)]
*  At some point, this one person was like, I'm not going to do that because I haven't seen [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=320.56s)]
*  him in months. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=325.0s)]
*  They were like people that would normally see the president, you know, even on a somewhat [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=326.32s)]
*  regular basis were no longer allowed to. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=332.32s)]
*  And even a few times we had one cabinet secretary that was allowed to go see him in that period, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=334.44s)]
*  2024, and they went in the meeting and they were shocked. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=339.67999999999995s)]
*  His mouth was agape. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  He seemed incoherent and they were really troubled. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=343.76s)]
*  When I think you have four cabinet secretaries just to follow up on that and they say that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  they were deeply concerned and they weren't sure who was making decisions. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=350.32s)]
*  Why didn't they come forward while they were serving? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=354.84s)]
*  Because it is a big deal. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=357.47999999999996s)]
*  It is a huge deal for the president of the United States to not have all of their faculties. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=359.2s)]
*  Why should people trust them now? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=363.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=365.76s)]
*  Because I don't know who these cabinet secretaries were, but maybe they probably want to work [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=366.76s)]
*  in a different administration. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=369.76s)]
*  They want to be on K Street. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=370.79999999999995s)]
*  They want to be at some think tank. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=372.35999999999996s)]
*  Why should anyone trust them when they spend all this time? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=374.12s)]
*  Apparently no one got this information and not telling anybody. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=376.96s)]
*  Now they have a lot to say. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=379.44s)]
*  It's a fair question. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=381.67999999999995s)]
*  And I think I would just encourage people to read the book. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=383.0s)]
*  It's also why we didn't just trust one cabinet secretary. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=387.08s)]
*  We tried to get as many as possible. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=389.88s)]
*  But I think it's a fair question why they did not speak out. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=392.92s)]
*  I can tell you there was some self-reflection in our interviews and I think they're still [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=395.28s)]
*  sort of tortured about it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=398.68s)]
*  At the end, their normal answer, believe it or not, you can take it for what it's worth, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=400.16s)]
*  but their answer usually was if we spoke out it wasn't going to change him from running [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=404.4s)]
*  and it was only going to help Trump. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=407.96s)]
*  Alex, of course, we've gotten some public comment from Camp Biden and this is from Naomi [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=410.20000000000005s)]
*  Biden, the former president's granddaughter, what she posted on X. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=416.8s)]
*  I'm not sure if you've seen it yet, but I'll read it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, let me read it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=424.52000000000004s)]
*  Just read a copy of this silly book and if anyone is curious for a review from someone [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=427.96000000000004s)]
*  who lived it firsthand, this book is political fairy smut for the permanent professional [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=431.70000000000005s)]
*  chattering class. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=436.56s)]
*  Put simply, it amounts to a bunch of unoriginal, uninspired lies written by irresponsible, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DRaAt76D8&t=437.56s)]
