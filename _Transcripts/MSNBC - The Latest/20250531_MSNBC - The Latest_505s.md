# Worst possible answer: Ernst downplays death as consequence of purging Medicaid
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0)
*  And then you can look at Medicaid cuts, Medicaid reforms, I should say. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=0.0s)]
*  Medicaid reforms, I should say. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=8.48s)]
*  I mean, forcing millions of Americans to lose their health care. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=10.4s)]
*  Sorry, can I start over? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=14.96s)]
*  That was, that answer was. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=16.96s)]
*  That was Republican congressman and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, someone [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  who should know better than, a better way to answer it at least, Jason Smith of Missouri, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=22.8s)]
*  struggling to spin the massive Medicaid cuts central to the big Republican budget bill [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=27.88s)]
*  the House passed last week. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=32.44s)]
*  Now up until this morning, that was the biggest foot in mouth, quiet part out loud, Freudian [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  slip moment, whatever you want to call it, we have seen from a Republican about that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=40.16s)]
*  bill. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  But this morning, one of his fellow Republicans said, hold my beer. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=45.04s)]
*  Iowa Republican Senator Joan Ernst held her first in-person town hall of the year, and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=49.96s)]
*  even though she held that town hall meeting at 730 a.m. on a Friday morning, which was [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=54.32s)]
*  on purpose, I am certain approximately 100 people showed up. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=58.92s)]
*  But I bet she wishes she hadn't, and they hadn't, because during that town hall, while [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=62.96s)]
*  answering a question about how Trump's big budget bill would throw millions of people [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  off Medicaid, Senator Ernst said this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=72.4s)]
*  They are not eligible, so they will be coming off. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=77.32s)]
*  So people are not, well, we all are going to die. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=81.84s)]
*  So for heaven's sakes, for heaven's sakes, folks. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=88.44s)]
*  For heaven's sakes, folks, calm down. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=95.76s)]
*  All Senator Ernst said was, let me just check my notes here, we are all going to die. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=99.36s)]
*  Literally what she said. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=107.88s)]
*  That is certainly one way to spin taking health care away from millions of Americans. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=109.4s)]
*  Now, saying something like that on a tape in a room full of people would be a bad day [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=114.56s)]
*  for any politician any day of the week. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=119.38s)]
*  But to make matters worse for Senator Ernst, among the 100 or so people that attended today's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=122.08s)]
*  event was this guy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=126.08s)]
*  Out of Iowa, a surprise challenger, Democrat Nathan Sage. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=129.86s)]
*  I'm fighting for a Democratic party that people like me will actually want to be a part of. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=133.84s)]
*  People like my dad, myself, my kids, all the people like us. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=139.12s)]
*  The DC elites, the ruling class, they don't want me, but I think maybe you will. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=143.84s)]
*  I'm Nathan Sage, dad, mechanic, sports radio host, vet, child of a trailer park in Iowa. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=150.0s)]
*  And I'm going to kick corporate Republican Joni Ernst ass next November. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=157.56s)]
*  Nathan Sage is the first Iowa Democrat to enter the race to face off against Iowa's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=163.24s)]
*  Republican Senator Joni Ernst next fall. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=167.6s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=170.16s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  That's quite an ad. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  We debated whether we could play the end, giving you a little curse word in there, but [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  it's spicy in a good way. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=177.76s)]
*  So let me ask you first. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  You were at Senator Ernst town hall today, as I've just mentioned. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=181.04s)]
*  What was your response in the moment when she tried to spin Medicaid cuts by saying [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=185.24s)]
*  we are all going to die? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=190.84s)]
*  Well, first of all, thank you for having me. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=192.48s)]
*  I'm still in shock. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=196.2s)]
*  I'm still pretty pissed off. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=198.96s)]
*  Honestly, what she said was a direct slap in the face to so many working class Americans [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=201.84s)]
*  that are trying to survive and need Medicaid to survive. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  And clearly, senators like Joni, backed by billionaires, don't care about us. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=210.0s)]
*  They don't care literally if we live or die now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=217.92s)]
*  And that's why I'm here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=220.04s)]
*  That's what I'm doing, what I'm doing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=222.12s)]
*  That's why I ask people to go to my website, staturescentred.com, hit the donate, hit the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=223.23999999999998s)]
*  volunteer, be a part of this movement, because we need to get politicians like Joni that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  don't work for the working class out of there so we can get people like me in there that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=232.72s)]
*  are going to fight for what's right. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=236.83999999999997s)]
*  And it's literally life and death right now, according to Joni. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=238.83999999999997s)]
*  No, it is life and death around a lot of things around Medicaid cuts and a lot of other things [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=243.76s)]
*  Also around all of the damage Doge has done. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=250.56s)]
*  And we've heard the show talking a little bit about Elon Musk and his sort of departure [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  from Washington. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=257.56s)]
*  Senator Ernst is also the head of the Senate Doge caucus. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=258.56s)]
*  There's such a thing. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=261.68s)]
*  Now that Elon Musk is supposedly, I guess, on his way out, but what do you make of Doge [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=264.08s)]
*  and Senator Ernst, specifically her involvement in all of it? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=270.32s)]
*  I think it's ridiculous. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  I think, you know, Joni, who is a veteran, clearly, we learned in the military, you never [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=276.0s)]
*  leave a fallen comrade, you never leave someone behind, has no problem leaving comrades and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=283.68s)]
*  fallen men behind when she's okay with 80,000 VA jobs going away. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=288.08s)]
*  She talked about today about how all the VA benefits aren't going to go away. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=292.88s)]
*  Well, you know, when you take 80,000 VA jobs away, you make that the whole VA a little [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=297.08s)]
*  bit slower, a little bit more inefficient. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=302.44s)]
*  So if you're trying to be efficient with Doge, then you take jobs. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=304.2s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=308.56s)]
*  And at the end of the day, it's to appease billionaires, it's appease the administration, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=309.56s)]
*  and it's to appease the people that she has to tow the line for. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=313.52s)]
*  Let's talk about how you're going to defeat her. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=318.2s)]
*  There's still a primary, there's a lot of time to go, but Trump did win Iowa by more [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=320.8s)]
*  than 13 points just a few months ago. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=325.64s)]
*  Things can change, political wins can change, but what's your plan to win the state back? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=328.96s)]
*  You know, looking at the state of Iowa, Trump won because he talked about lowering the cost [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=333.76s)]
*  of living. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  And we work at, I'm a working class candidate, we have so many working class Americans in [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=339.8s)]
*  Iowa that are just struggling every single day to survive. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=344.12s)]
*  Literally every day, the rich keep getting richer, the poor get poorer. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=348.24s)]
*  We are trying to figure out how to put food on our tables. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=350.66s)]
*  We're trying to just make ends meet. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=352.8s)]
*  And that's where we got to start. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=354.8s)]
*  We got to raise wages, we got to lower costs of health care, we got to lower the cost of [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=355.98s)]
*  daycare. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=360.08s)]
*  We got to make paid sick leave a real thing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=361.47999999999996s)]
*  And we just got to make life more affordable. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=364.35999999999996s)]
*  And I feel like that is something that cuts along both lines, both parties. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=366.24s)]
*  Everybody is affected by it and everybody wants it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=371.24s)]
*  Everybody wants a better, bigger piece of the pie. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=373.26s)]
*  And that's why I'm here, because if you watch my video, you know that I have no problem [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=375.52s)]
*  saying the things that need to be said to get the attention drawn to what we're fighting [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=379.88s)]
*  for. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=384.32s)]
*  And we're not going to back down. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=385.32s)]
*  We're going to keep trying to do what we can to survive, because that's what we've been [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=386.76s)]
*  doing this whole time as working class individuals. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=390.56s)]
*  You said something to my colleague Jonathan Capehart last month. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=394.36s)]
*  A lot of other people running for office have said something similar. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=397.6s)]
*  People who are in office who are in the Democratic Party have said something similar. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=399.76s)]
*  You said you want to tear the Democratic Party down and build it back up from the studs. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=403.12s)]
*  Tell us more. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=408.28s)]
*  I mean, practically speaking, what do you mean by that? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=409.28s)]
*  You know, when it looks, we look at Iowa and it seems like there's a lot of dysfunction [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=411.98s)]
*  with the Democratic Party. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=416.84000000000003s)]
*  And we have a lot of people that are the way I look at it are, you know, the elitist or [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=417.84s)]
*  the soft handed doctor's kid or somebody that comes to our neighborhood and says certain [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=423.08s)]
*  things and promises the world. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=428.59999999999997s)]
*  And it doesn't end that way for us. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  We go through the same cycle over and over and over and expect a different result. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=432.52s)]
*  And I think that we need to make it where we have more working class candidates. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=435.96s)]
*  We need to overturn Citizens United and allow people like myself and more working class [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=439.15999999999997s)]
*  individuals to get into races where they have a chance to win because that's real representation. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=444.64s)]
*  The people that go through it every day and understand the struggle of everyday life here [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=450.12s)]
*  in Iowa, they're the ones that can speak on it and they're the ones that should be representing [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=453.56s)]
*  those people and not having some elitist telling us how they're going to do something and then [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvlw3hcIG0&t=458.0s)]
