# ‘Would have to come from top down’: Ex-FBI official reacts to Comey being investigated for post
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8)
*  In a new interview with MSNBC, former FBI Director James Comey says it never occurred [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=0.0s)]
*  to him that a picture he posted would be viewed as an assassination threat against President [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=6.44s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=11.48s)]
*  Now, Comey confirmed to MSNBC's Nicole Wallace that the Secret Service had interviewed him [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=12.48s)]
*  about this photo, shells, arranged into the numbers 8647. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=17.12s)]
*  Trump allies have alleged he was calling for 86ing, or getting rid of, the 47th president. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=24.24s)]
*  But here's Comey explaining the conversation he had with his wife after they found the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=30.959999999999997s)]
*  shells on the beach. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=34.76s)]
*  She said, you know, 86, when I was a server, she did a lot of work in restaurants, meant [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  to remove an item from the menu when you ran out of ingredients. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=41.84s)]
*  And I said, well, to me, as a kid, it always meant to leave a place, to ditch a place. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=44.68s)]
*  I said, that's really clever. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=49.0s)]
*  So then she said, you should take a picture of that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=50.84s)]
*  And I did. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  And I posted it on my Instagram account and thought nothing more of it until I heard through [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=53.52s)]
*  her that people were saying it was some sort of a call for assassination, which is crazy. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  But I took it down. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=63.6s)]
*  Even if I think it's crazy, I don't want to be associated with violence of any kind. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is Christopher O'Leary, former FBI counterterrorism official and senior vice [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  president for global operations at the Sufan Group. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=74.30000000000001s)]
*  Good to have you here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=76.84s)]
*  If that's what James Comey told agents, presumably that's what he told agents what he just told [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=79.04s)]
*  Nicole, would they ask him to establish if it instead was meant as a threat against the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  president? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=92.28s)]
*  How would they come to that conclusion? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=93.28s)]
*  Somewhat of an academic point, actually. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  First of all, the Secret Service has thousands of threats against president and former presidents [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=96.76s)]
*  every year. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=102.68s)]
*  It is really thousands, thousands. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=103.68s)]
*  It is rare that they would pull somebody in like this, certainly not a former director of the FBI. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=107.2s)]
*  So the term 86 actually comes from Chumley's, which was a famous Prohibition era bar here [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=112.4s)]
*  in New York City. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  And it was 86 Bedford Street. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  And they would give a warning to their patrons to get out the back if it was being raided [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=122.56s)]
*  by the police. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=127.78s)]
*  Those patrons at that time were Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=129.04s)]
*  So that's relevant because the term does not mean assassination. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=133.9s)]
*  And the case law that the Supreme Court established and other lesser courts established in the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=139.18s)]
*  late 60s, it has to be a true and legitimate threat that an objective reasonable person [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  would believe for at least the statute for threats against the president was intended [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=149.94s)]
*  to inflict serious bodily harm or death upon the president or former protectee. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=155.02s)]
*  So James Comey also told MSNBC that he has been cooperating with the investigation so [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=160.82s)]
*  far. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  Let me play that for you. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  I got a call from the Secret Service that night asking if I would speak to them about [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=169.7s)]
*  it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=174.42s)]
*  Of course, I admire the Secret Service. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=175.42s)]
*  They're pros. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=177.06s)]
*  I spoke to them on the phone. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=178.06s)]
*  Then they asked the next day when I got home, would I be willing to come in and meet them [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=179.06s)]
*  in person at the Washington Field Office, which again I did. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=182.42s)]
*  And they were pros again. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  So he doesn't have anything bad to say about them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=188.7s)]
*  Does it put pressure on DOJ though that Donald Trump has said he believes Comey knew exactly [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=191.14s)]
*  what he was doing? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=197.82s)]
*  Well, it certainly does because DOJ has been completely rebuilt with what appears to be [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=198.82s)]
*  loyal followers of the administration. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=206.33999999999997s)]
*  Traditionally, the two charges that you would pursue, the one, you know, Title 18, 871 is [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=208.73999999999998s)]
*  threats against the president and the other one is 875 interstate threats. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=214.94s)]
*  You have to meet the components of those statutes. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=219.5s)]
*  You're nowhere near here. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=223.18s)]
*  So DOJ supporting a prosecution in this, it would have to come from top down because, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=224.38s)]
*  you know, no U.S. Attorney's Office, no line prosecutor is going to be able to support [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=230.46s)]
*  an investigation and move towards, you know, anything close to a charge. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=236.98s)]
*  Can I ask you about the Ashley Babbit case? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=241.42s)]
*  I'm reminding people that she is the woman who attempted to storm the House Speaker's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=244.1s)]
*  lobby during January 6th when the Capitol was stormed. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=249.54s)]
*  She was shot and killed. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=253.82s)]
*  And now the Trump administration has said they're ready to pay nearly five million dollars [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=255.38s)]
*  to her family to respond to a lawsuit brought by her estate, according to two people familiar [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=262.38s)]
*  with the matter. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=268.0s)]
*  What do you think is the message that is sent with this payout? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=269.0s)]
*  I think it's appealing to the base. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=273.18s)]
*  Again, she's become a rallying cry around the extreme maggot base, those who wanted [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=275.53999999999996s)]
*  to have the January 6th hostages released. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=282.21999999999997s)]
*  Ashley Babbit is definitely a victim. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=286.9s)]
*  It's tragic that a young woman and a mother was killed, but there was nothing that was [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=289.38s)]
*  done wrong by the Capitol police. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=294.26s)]
*  They were exonerated. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=295.78s)]
*  They actually went through their force continuum and tried to, you know, not use lethal force. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=297.24s)]
*  They did, but they were exonerated because it was within their standards. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=303.24s)]
*  She is a victim and was manipulated by those putting out the disinformation or misinformation [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=307.92s)]
*  that led her to join QAnon, that led her to believe that the election was rigged and become [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=312.92s)]
*  part of a violent mob storming the Capitol that day. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=318.72s)]
*  So if anybody should be compensating her family, it's those that have put out all of those [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=321.5s)]
*  falsities that catalyzed her to show up on that day. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=326.48s)]
*  Christopher O'Leary, it's always good to have you here, especially on set. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  Thanks for coming in. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNP2hj70kW8&t=333.0s)]
