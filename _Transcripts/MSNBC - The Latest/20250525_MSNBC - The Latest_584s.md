# Rep. Neguse calls out ‘brazen corruption’ of Trump crypto coin dinner
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY)
*  lavish Virginia golf club where over 200 ultra wealthy investors bought exclusive access to the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=0.0s)]
*  president. In total, the guest spent 394 million dollars on Trump's meme coin, which averages out [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=6.72s)]
*  to about 1.8 million dollars each. Now that is an expensive fancy dinner. Some of the high-profile [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  guests included tech CEO Jack Lew, former Lamar, former Lakers, power forward Lamar Odom, and top [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Trump coin buyer Justin Sun, who was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2023 [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=29.28s)]
*  over alleged fraud. That case is still pending, although NBC reports the SEC is exploring a [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=35.92s)]
*  possible settlement or dismissal following Trump's second inauguration. And after the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=41.68s)]
*  White House insisted his dinner was a private event, Trump gave a speech with a podium that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  had the presidential seal, raising even more concerns about how he's profiting off of his [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  presidency. So with us now is Assistant Democratic Leader and Colorado Congressman Joe Noguist. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=57.92s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for being with us. I am guessing you weren't at the crypto dinner [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=64.08s)]
*  the other night. Yeah, good morning. Good morning. Good to be with you. Yeah, I was not at that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  outrageous dinner. What do you make of it? It is just so blatant and catering to the wealthy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=76.4s)]
*  I just can't imagine if any other president had said they were taking a night off to host a dinner [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=84.0s)]
*  where people had to pay almost two million to have a seat at the table. Yeah, I couldn't agree with [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=89.28s)]
*  you more. Blatant is the right word. It is outrageous. It's the type of brazen corruption [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=95.68s)]
*  that should shock the conscience of every American. It's the type of brazen corruption that, frankly, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=101.44s)]
*  we haven't seen probably since a century. I mean, you have to go back to the teapot dome scandal of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=106.4s)]
*  the 1920s to find this kind of corruption within the executive branch. And the fact that my [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=111.92s)]
*  Republican colleagues have done nothing to condemn it or even call it into question is shameful. In [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=118.88s)]
*  any functioning Congress, this type of conduct would already be investigated. But of course, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  that is not the case under a Republican majority in the House as it exists today. Congressman, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=131.6s)]
*  folks who are having trouble paying their bills, who eggs are too expensive, they have to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=137.2s)]
*  make sure their kids are getting off to school on time, they have one or two or maybe three [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=142.32s)]
*  jobs right now, why should they care about a dinner like this? Why should they care that these [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  powerful people with all of this money are getting this amount of access to the president? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=154.4s)]
*  That's a great question. I think there's a risk of viewing these developments, these scandals [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=160.48s)]
*  myopically as opposed to holistically, right? And when you consider the events of this past week, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=166.08s)]
*  this outrageous, corrupt dinner that the president hosted for billionaires that are patting the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=172.0s)]
*  pockets of him and his family, coupled with the legislation, the budget reconciliation bill, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=179.44s)]
*  the tax scam that House Republicans muscled through in Washington this week that would gut [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=184.96s)]
*  healthcare for millions of Americans that would deprive millions of single mothers, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=190.4s)]
*  of children, of seniors, of food assistants, all to pay for tax cuts for the richest Americans, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=196.08s)]
*  for billionaires in our country. It gives you a clearer sense of this administration's priorities. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  At the end of the day, this administration has forgotten the middle class. The Trump administration [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=209.12s)]
*  does not care about helping make the lives of the American people, of the average American, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=214.56s)]
*  better and instead are focused exclusively on the top 10, top 1 percent of the country. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=219.92s)]
*  And ultimately, I think that the voters see it for what it is and they will render their verdict [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  come next November. You know, Congressman, it also seems like the president and his administration [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=232.64s)]
*  don't care about optics or ethics. I mean, when the White House press secretary was asked about [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=238.0s)]
*  this dinner, she said it was personal time, that the president was at a private event. But as we [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=245.04s)]
*  showed in the clip, in the intro of this segment, he's standing at a podium with the presidential [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=252.0s)]
*  seal. So can you please explain to the American people why they should be upset that the president [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=257.76s)]
*  of the United States, with the seal in front of him, you can see it right there, that he is [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=264.64s)]
*  using the office to enrich himself? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, Jonathan, you said it well. The corruption in this instance [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=277.2s)]
*  is very clear cut. It's not a difficult scenario for the American people to understand. The fact [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=281.44s)]
*  that you have billionaires, including some who are foreign billionaires. We don't, of course, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=287.92s)]
*  know because the White House has not detailed or released publicly the list of attendees at that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=293.44s)]
*  dinner. But these are individuals who are investing directly in this meme coin that the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=299.2s)]
*  president personally profits from to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. And in return, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=304.4s)]
*  they get an exclusive dinner with the president of the United States. And who knows what else? And, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=309.76s)]
*  of course, Jonathan, as you know, this president was very critical of the crypto industry just a [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=313.84s)]
*  few short years ago. Of course, we know what changed in that short period of time. He's now [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=318.96s)]
*  making a lot of money from the industry. So, yeah, make no mistake. I think the American [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=324.08s)]
*  people get it. They understand the reason that the administration has been unable or perhaps [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=328.88s)]
*  unwilling to even try to offer a cogent rationale or explanation for their conduct. Of course, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=334.24s)]
*  they know none exists, but also they know that they will not be held accountable by this Republican [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  Congress. So they have no fear as to any potential investigations or any effort to hold the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=345.84s)]
*  administration to the standards that have governed the executive branch since time immemorial. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=351.52s)]
*  Congressman, let's move on to the budget bill. Just got through the House. What are your concerns [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=357.52s)]
*  with the bill and what do you do for see any changes or any more sweeteners added in in the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=363.12s)]
*  Senate so that to get those wavering Senate, the wobbly ones on board? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=369.44s)]
*  Well, I certainly fear what sweeteners, as you said, the Republicans in the Senate may offer [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=373.92s)]
*  to their colleagues to get this bill to the president's desk, given the process that the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=382.64000000000004s)]
*  bill went through in the House. As you know, they passed this bill in the dead of night. We [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=387.92s)]
*  participated in a 21-hour unprecedented legislative markup of the bill in the Rules Committee. And as [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  the hours went on, they scheduled this hearing for one a.m. because they understood that they [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=399.04s)]
*  couldn't defend the bill in the light of day. And as the hearing went on, we learned more and more [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=404.08000000000004s)]
*  about various provisions that had been added to the bill in an attempt to buy the support of our [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=408.88s)]
*  colleagues. And one of those provisions, just by way of example, is a provision to deregulate [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  firearm silencers. These are silencers that have been regulated since 1934, since the days of Al [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=419.44s)]
*  Capone and John Dillinger. And House Republicans decided that this was in the best interest, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=426.0s)]
*  apparently, of the American public to include this provision at the 11th hour. There are a variety [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=430.8s)]
*  of others, a provision that they included as a tax break to tanning salon owners, which was only [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=435.52s)]
*  removed after we had shamed our colleagues during the course of the hearing, such that they, I [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=442.16s)]
*  assume, concluded that it was not in their best interest to move forward with it. So we'll see. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=448.32s)]
*  They barely got the bill through the House. It passed on a party line vote and only passed with [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=453.84s)]
*  one vote, essentially, right? One vote margin. So I believe that ultimately, if the outcry is [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  loud enough, if we make the case in the court of public opinion, that we can hopefully defeat this [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  bill in the United States Senate and avert the calamity that it would create for working families [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=471.68s)]
*  across Colorado and the United States. Congressman, you're a member of leadership. You [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=477.76s)]
*  called what we're seeing with President Trump and his administration for his encryption. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=482.96s)]
*  You know, there's a few ways that curry favor with President Trump. That's the crypto [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=487.04s)]
*  lane, the Trump properties, buying stock in Trump media is another one, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=490.4s)]
*  as you guys said, to enrich himself and his family. If Democrats take back the House next November, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=494.88s)]
*  when you guys walk in in January, are you guys going to do commit to starting to [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=501.28s)]
*  investigate these things on behalf of the American people? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=505.76s)]
*  Yeah, what I would say, Eugene, is that ultimately, at the end of the day, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=508.4s)]
*  the American people deserve a government that is ethical and responsive to their concerns, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  to the concerns of working families, not to billionaires and ultimately not a government [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=520.4s)]
*  that is constituted of people who are enriching themselves. You see that at the White House. By [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=526.0s)]
*  the way, you see that in the Congress with my Republican colleagues trading stocks, as you know, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=531.12s)]
*  enriching their own stock portfolios instead of focusing on their constituents. We will engage [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=536.24s)]
*  in vigorous oversight. You have folks like my colleague, Jamie Raskin, who's the ranking [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=541.36s)]
*  member of the Judiciary Committee, who understands these issues quite well. And yeah, make no mistake, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=545.92s)]
*  we'll certainly perform our constitutional duties under Article One of the Constitution to hold the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=552.4s)]
*  administration accountable and to deliver a more responsive government to the American people, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  which really is what [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYv7ZMa5mY&t=562.5600000000001s)]
