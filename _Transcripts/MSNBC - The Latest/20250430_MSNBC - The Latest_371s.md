# Trump: ‘I could’ get Kilmar Abrego Garcia back
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo)
*  Joining us now is Lee Gelernt, one of the lead attorneys fighting Trump's deportations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=0.0s)]
*  He's also deputy director of the Immigrants' Rights Project at the ACLU. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=4.4s)]
*  Lee, I know you're not directly involved in Moshen's case, but I wanted to get your reaction [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  to his release today. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=13.8s)]
*  And you know, there are other students still being detained or threatened with detention. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Does this move the needle in any of those other cases? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  Well, hopefully it does. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=21.6s)]
*  You know, this is an important principle that we're fighting for, which is that people [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=25.16s)]
*  should not be punished for their speech, for nonviolent speech. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=30.380000000000003s)]
*  And so people are being detained and they're being whisked away to Louisiana and other [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=34.8s)]
*  places. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  So I think this is an important step forward of the judge releasing someone who's not [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=41.16s)]
*  dangerous, who's being punished solely for his speech. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=45.28s)]
*  So we'll see how it plays out in other courts, but we think this does move the needle forward. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  I also want to ask you, I want to switch gears to Kimmar Abrego-Garcia's case, the man who [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=54.08s)]
*  was mistakenly deported from Maryland to El Salvador. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  The president told ABC News last night that he could bring him back to the U.S., but suggested [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  he's not going to do it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=66.16s)]
*  That could be important, right? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=68.02s)]
*  Because that contradicts previous claims by the administration that they have no power [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=69.08s)]
*  over what El Salvador does. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=72.56s)]
*  Do you expect that statement to come up in court and possibly help Abrego-Garcia's case [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=74.48s)]
*  and other individuals who have been deported in a similar manner? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=79.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right to ask about that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=83.28s)]
*  I think we've always known that the United States could get people out of that prison. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=84.92s)]
*  I mean, we're the ones sending them to that prison and we're the ones paying for it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=88.52s)]
*  And the Salvadoran government is doing it at our behest. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=92.52s)]
*  So the president acknowledging that I think is important, but it's something we've always [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=95.52s)]
*  known and I suspect it will play a role in court. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  I mean, the Supreme Court has already said that the United States government needs to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=102.32s)]
*  facilitate his return. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=105.36s)]
*  Now there's no question, I think, in anybody's mind that they can facilitate the return if [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=107.46s)]
*  they want to. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=113.1s)]
*  And hopefully the courts put their foot down and say that needs to happen. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=114.1s)]
*  And as you pointed out, it's not just Abrego-Garcia. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=117.58s)]
*  We have hundreds of Venezuelan men who were illegally removed under the Alien Enemies [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  Act, the wartime authority that's only been used during war and now the Trump administration [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=125.72s)]
*  is trying to do it during peacetime. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=130.1s)]
*  And now sitting in this brutal Salvadoran prison, we're going to try and get them back [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=133.38s)]
*  as well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=141.29999999999998s)]
*  And we think there's no question the administration can facilitate their return as President [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  Trump apparently acknowledged. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=146.28s)]
*  I didn't see the statement, but apparently he's acknowledging that he could get them [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=147.6s)]
*  out. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=151.4s)]
*  And in a related issue, a judge today denied the government's request to pause the discovery [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=153.0s)]
*  stage in the Abrego-Garcia case. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=157.54s)]
*  A lot of what lawyers are asking for in that case has direct connection to the ACLU's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=159.86s)]
*  case involving the Aliens Enemies Act. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=164.9s)]
*  The things they're asking for are the things we've been asking. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=167.12s)]
*  How are they choosing these individuals? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=169.96s)]
*  They're asking for the contract with El Salvador. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=171.70000000000002s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=173.98000000000002s)]
*  What is the agreement? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=174.98000000000002s)]
*  What is the most important insight you think you could gain from some of this discovery [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=176.06s)]
*  that starting on Friday, the judge says, has to be turned in? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=179.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=183.14000000000001s)]
*  So I think you're right to point out what exactly is our agreement with El Salvador. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  We've always said that this is essentially a U.S. prison in El Salvador, that we're sending [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=189.34s)]
*  the people there, we're choosing who goes there, and we're paying for it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=194.94s)]
*  You know, the Abrego-Garcia thing is a one-off in some respects because the government's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=198.70000000000002s)]
*  admitted it was an administrative mistake. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  But the Venezuelan men we know are being sent there under the Alien Enemies Act, and we're [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=205.10000000000002s)]
*  challenging that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=208.82000000000002s)]
*  We know they didn't get to process. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=209.82000000000002s)]
*  We also think that it's a wartime authority that can't be used during peacetime. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=211.74s)]
*  So more about how they're choosing to send people to El Salvador is critical. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=215.94s)]
*  But we already know from the evidence that's emerging that people were not actually gang [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=220.1s)]
*  members who were sent there, and they're using a sloppy process of just assuming that because [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  people have certain tattoos that they're members of the gang. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=229.74s)]
*  And more and more evidence is emerging that they're not actually gang members. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=233.14000000000001s)]
*  They were strongly disputed, and that's why there needs to be due process. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=236.86s)]
*  And I think that's why you see people on both sides of the aisle coming out and saying there [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=239.82s)]
*  has to be due process. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=243.94s)]
*  Otherwise, they can pick anybody up and send them to El Salvador, and those people could [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=245.38s)]
*  spend the rest of their lives there. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=248.98s)]
*  And I want to play you on that note. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=251.74s)]
*  I want to play you the sound from the president last night when he was asked about this and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=252.98s)]
*  essentially said due process for migrants is going to take too long. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=256.06s)]
*  Have a listen. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=259.02s)]
*  If you're going to have 21 million people and we have to get a lot of them out because [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=260.02s)]
*  they're criminals, we're going to have to act fast. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=264.58s)]
*  We can't do you think we can give 21 million trials? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=267.74s)]
*  Let's say each trial takes two weeks. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=272.58s)]
*  Is that what you want us to do? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=274.9s)]
*  The law is the law, sir. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=275.9s)]
*  The law is the law. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=276.9s)]
*  And you're smart. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=277.9s)]
*  The law doesn't say anything about trials. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=278.9s)]
*  No, not trials. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=280.34s)]
*  Hearings. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=281.34s)]
*  Lee, do you have a response for the president? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=282.34s)]
*  So I think the reporter there was absolutely right that these are not full blown trials [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=287.3s)]
*  like jury trials. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=292.62s)]
*  But putting that aside, I mean, due process is not a luxury. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  It's the very foundation of a system based on the rule of law has been absolutely a [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=296.86s)]
*  essential in our country. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  And without it, anybody could end up in that Salvadoran prison. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=304.02000000000004s)]
*  It has to be the case that people get due process. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=308.3s)]
*  And I think that's why you're seeing people from all different vantage points, conservative, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  liberal, just saying, look, we can't just pick people up off the street and send them. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=316.14s)]
*  So that's why the Constitution says due process for all persons. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=320.82s)]
*  It didn't say all due process just for citizens. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=324.90000000000003s)]
*  Interestingly, this Constitution points out certain provisions that only apply to citizens. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=328.3s)]
*  You have to be a citizen to be the president. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=333.38s)]
*  But with respect to due process, the framers said all persons. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=335.94s)]
*  And that's been critical throughout our 200 plus years in the country. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=341.18s)]
*  We can't abandon it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=344.34000000000003s)]
*  All right, legal. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=345.82s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=347.5s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaJ9haxcHo&t=349.82s)]
