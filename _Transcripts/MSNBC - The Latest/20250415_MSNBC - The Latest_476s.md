*  can admit and hire and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue and just in the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=32.16s)]
*  last hour the president is hitting back at the school. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  NBC's Garrett Haig has more from the White House Garrett good morning what is the president [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=41.84s)]
*  saying as of now? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=46.16s)]
*  Jose the president is in the mood to escalate this fight with Harvard still further in his [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  truth social post he speculates about the university losing its tax exempt status as [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=52.9s)]
*  an educational institution. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=58.42s)]
*  He makes some factually questionable statements here about the idea that the university being [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=60.5s)]
*  taxed as a political entity there's not really any such thing but he argues that if they [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=65.14s)]
*  continue to push political elements that they should lose that tax exempt status that most [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=69.74s)]
*  schools and universities have it is not as with many things related to this president [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=76.02s)]
*  especially clear if that's the kind of thing he can do unilaterally or through pressure [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=81.94s)]
*  on the IRS to strip a university of their tax exempt status you wouldn't even normally [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=86.1s)]
*  talk about it in a more traditional administration but this president has shown no real qualms [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=90.66s)]
*  about leaning on the various executive agencies ostensibly under his control to exactly this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=96.89999999999999s)]
*  kind of political retribution Jose. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  So what can the White House actually do any idea of what he's planning next? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=104.82s)]
*  Well look they still have this task force in place which operates independently from [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=111.34s)]
*  the Department of Education and has been going after various universities first for policies [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=115.34s)]
*  that they might view as anti-Semitic and then going still further as we saw here in the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=120.42s)]
*  case of Harvard to look at other elements of their admission procedures and DEI they [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=124.22s)]
*  could make life miserable for Harvard by opening investigations under the Department of Education [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=128.82s)]
*  or by using this task force they've already shown a willingness to cut off some federal [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=134.26s)]
*  funding to the university but there are other federal programs that are available to Harvard [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=138.82000000000002s)]
*  students that might also be targeted. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=142.5s)]
*  I don't think we know yet exactly how creative the administration wants to be in extending [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  this fight but I do see that truth social post from the president as if not an order [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  at least a suggestion to the IRS that they better start looking for more ways to punish [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=155.5s)]
*  this university. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=160.10000000000002s)]
*  Gareth Haig at the White House thank you so very much and joining us now on Andrew Manuel [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=161.10000000000002s)]
*  Crespo a law professor at Harvard and general counsel of the Harvard faculty chapter of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=166.46s)]
*  the American Association of University Professors. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for being with us professor what's your reaction to all of this including the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=174.18s)]
*  latest truth social post by the president? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=178.46s)]
*  I think the president's post makes clear what this is all really about. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=183.70000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to control what is taught in America's universities. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=186.98000000000002s)]
*  He wants to try to use all of the tools of the federal government to break the backs [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=191.02s)]
*  of these institutions unless they parrot his own preferred ideology. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=194.7s)]
*  This is a page straight out of authoritarian playbooks. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=199.06s)]
*  If you look across history and across the globe when people come into power who wants [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=202.5s)]
*  to try to maintain and control power in a way that's contrary to the basic norms of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=206.5s)]
*  a constitutional democracy they attack some of the core institutions of civil society. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=211.14s)]
*  They attack the press they attack the courts they attack the legal profession and they [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=215.88s)]
*  attack universities and that's what's happening here and the president isn't even pretending [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=219.72s)]
*  about it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=223.6s)]
*  The truth social message makes clear that he wants to change what he views as the ideology [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=225.54s)]
*  of what's being taught at American universities and make it more to his liking. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=228.68s)]
*  He wants them to be following the Trump syllabus instead of the syllabi that have been created [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=232.14s)]
*  by these universities over the past century that have made them the shining example of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  what higher education should look like in the world. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  He's going to break the back of American universities if he persists this way but I'm proud to see [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=243.5s)]
*  that universities like Harvard are standing tall and saying this is a red line. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=247.24s)]
*  You cannot have the federal government trying to tell people what to teach inside of our universities. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=251.6s)]
*  It violates the First Amendment. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=255.6s)]
*  It violates the laws of our country and it is flat out dangerous authoritarian moves. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=257.6s)]
*  So Andrew do you actually think that the president of the United States could to use your term [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=261.6s)]
*  break the backs of universities in our country? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=266.6s)]
*  I mean what will this already what is already going on these funding freezes what will that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=269.6s)]
*  mean for for Harvard and how do you see the possibilities of the president breaking the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=277.1s)]
*  back of universities? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=283.1s)]
*  Well this is exactly why our chapter which is a chapter of faculty members here at Harvard [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=285.1s)]
*  University that's part of a national organization called the American Association of University [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=290.1s)]
*  Professors this is why we went to court Friday night and filed a lawsuit to stop this from [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=294.1s)]
*  happening. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=298.1s)]
*  What Donald Trump is threatening is unconstitutional. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=299.1s)]
*  This country has a First Amendment. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=302.1s)]
*  It guarantees the freedom of speech. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=303.6s)]
*  The Supreme Court has made clear that academic freedom at universities is a central component [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=305.6s)]
*  of that freedom of speech. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=309.6s)]
*  It is against the fundamental law of our nation to try to tell a private university that it [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=311.1s)]
*  has to change who is teaching how they are teaching what they are researching what they [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=317.1s)]
*  are writing what they are saying in their classrooms what they are saying on their campuses [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=321.6s)]
*  to threaten people with loss of funding or other types of coercive measures from the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=325.1s)]
*  government to get them to change what they're saying violates the First Amendment of the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=329.1s)]
*  United States. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=332.6s)]
*  It's plain and simple. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=333.6s)]
*  I don't think he's going to break the backs of American University because American universities [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=335.1s)]
*  are going to stand up against him as Harvard is now and I hope to see universities across [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=338.6s)]
*  the country standing firm and united against this onslaught. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=343.1s)]
*  Is it going to be hard? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=346.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=348.1s)]
*  Is it going to be painful? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=349.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=350.1s)]
*  But are we going to prevail in it? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=351.1s)]
*  I think we are because we have the Constitution on our side and we have the core principles [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=352.1s)]
*  of academic freedom and the role that these universities play in democracy as the reason [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=356.6s)]
*  for why we're doing it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=360.6s)]
*  You know, interestingly you talk about the core principles. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=361.6s)]
*  Is it a constitutional order for the federal government to fund institutions of higher [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=363.6s)]
*  education? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=372.1s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=375.1s)]
*  Congress has the power of the purse and for the past half century and more Congress has [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=376.1s)]
*  thought it was useful for the country and it has proven to be incredibly useful for [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=380.6s)]
*  the country to have a partnership with our leading research universities. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  That partnership has produced cures for some of the most intractable diseases. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=388.6s)]
*  That partnership has led to advances in technology that have made us the economy that's the envy [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=392.1s)]
*  of the world. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=396.1s)]
*  Our partnership between Congress, the federal government and research universities has been [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=397.1s)]
*  something that has been so beneficial for the American people. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=401.6s)]
*  That's the partnership that President Trump is now trying to unilaterally end. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=404.6s)]
*  He's doing it against the will of Congress which appropriated these funds and which put [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=409.6s)]
*  in place an entire statutory scheme in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that says how these [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=413.6s)]
*  funds are to be regulated. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=418.6s)]
*  President Trump is disregarding all of that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=419.6s)]
*  He's ignoring Congress's statutes. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=421.6s)]
*  He's ignoring Congress's will. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=423.1s)]
*  He's ignoring the will of the American people. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=424.1s)]
*  Our constitutional democracy depends on having universities that are not just leading the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=426.6s)]
*  way in research but that are helping us understand the core aspects of our democracy. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=431.6s)]
*  I teach at a law school. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=435.6s)]
*  We're talking about the rule of law. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=436.6s)]
*  Donald Trump's threatened by schools that talk about the rule of law because he is a [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=438.6s)]
*  threat to the rule of law. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=442.1s)]
*  When we have these types of programs and institutions threatened, it's a danger to the country and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=443.1s)]
*  it's the reason why these institutions need to and are now starting to stand up and fight. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=448.1s)]
*  Andrew Manuel-Grez, well thank you very much for your time. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=452.1s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8RoZLsQc0&t=455.1s)]
