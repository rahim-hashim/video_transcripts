# MAGA's road to authoritarianism: How Trump 2.0 mirrors Hungary's Viktor Orban
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw)
*  I also want to pay a very special regard to the leader of Hungary, Viktor Orbán, who's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=0.0s)]
*  a great man and highly respected by everybody. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  He's done a brilliant job of leading, and he's a very, very special person. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=11.6s)]
*  That was, of course, President Donald Trump praising one of his favorite autocrats, Hungarian [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=18.6s)]
*  Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, in a video message aired at a CPAC event in Budapest. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=22.72s)]
*  Orbán was the event's keynote speaker. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=28.68s)]
*  And yes, that is the CPAC that started here in America. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=30.72s)]
*  Orbán said that Trump's reelection, quote, changed the world. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=34.8s)]
*  I think everyone would agree with him there. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=38.44s)]
*  He also laid out a new plan to reshape the European Union, a plan that includes taking, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=40.76s)]
*  quote, Europe back from migrants and pushing for, quote, Christian culture and schools [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=45.6s)]
*  based on national principles. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=50.72s)]
*  Sound familiar? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Michelle Norris is back with us, and joining the conversation is Adam Soraya, a staff writer [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=54.2s)]
*  at The Atlantic. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=58.24s)]
*  And Adam, you wrote this amazing piece that came out this week, kind of about this, about [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=59.24s)]
*  this war on education and that there's a through line and it's a part of a larger plan. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=65.12s)]
*  You said there's a comprehensive attack on knowledge itself. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=73.88s)]
*  What do you think is behind this? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=77.4s)]
*  How does that connect to what we're seeing in Hungary as well? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=79.0s)]
*  Well, I think there are two things that are behind it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=82.2s)]
*  One is that the Trump administration sees educated people, college educated people, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=85.64s)]
*  as a sort of class enemy as a result of them trending left over the past few years. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=90.68s)]
*  So they see colleges themselves as some liberal factories that manufacture their political [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=95.04s)]
*  opposition and they want to shut that down. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=101.36s)]
*  They want to turn these institutions into propaganda mills for their own ideology. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=103.16s)]
*  And the second thing is that they don't want any empirical knowledge that can be used to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  foster political opposition against the administration. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=115.16s)]
*  They don't want any sort of high level empirical studies that will do things like make the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  case for taxing the wealthy or regulating industry or ensuring that people have equal [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=124.92s)]
*  rights under the law. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=129.96s)]
*  Because as you just noted, with Orban's description of what he wants society to be like, he wants [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=130.84s)]
*  a specific class of people to be above everybody else. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=136.64s)]
*  And that's exactly what's happening here in the United States. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=139.92s)]
*  And Adam, I'm going to read you back to you in the same piece you say, by destroying knowledge, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=142.28s)]
*  Trumpists seek to make the country more amenable to their political domination and to prevent [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=150.6s)]
*  meaningful democratic checks on their behavior. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=155.56s)]
*  And Michelle, I mean, it seems to me that that is exactly what Donald Trump and the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=158.36s)]
*  people around him want to do. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=166.28s)]
*  And the damage that even what they're doing now is we're looking at generations worth [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=167.72s)]
*  of damage here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=174.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=175.48s)]
*  And this is where this segment is in conversation with the last segment. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  I've been reading a lot of Frederick Douglass lately. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  And he seems to be speaking through the ages at this moment right now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=182.6s)]
*  He said that knowledge makes a man unfit to be a slave. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  Now, he was talking about slavery, but he was also talking about just being oppressed. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  He said that he prayed for freedom and education answered the call. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=194.11999999999998s)]
*  He also said that a tyrant's power is prescribed by the endurance of those he is trying to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=197.4s)]
*  oppress. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=204.84s)]
*  And that speaks to us right now. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=205.8s)]
*  And that's why what President Garber is doing and Howard is so important. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=207.32s)]
*  That's why people need to understand that standing up to this, they do back down. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=210.44s)]
*  We've seen that in the courts. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  They're, you know, they're flooding the zone and they're trying to figure out where they [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=216.76s)]
*  can move forward. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=219.4s)]
*  But this is a moment where people do have to figure out how to stand up and knowledge [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=220.52s)]
*  is their enemy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=224.52s)]
*  They don't want people to be informed. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=226.04s)]
*  They don't want people to be able to file lawsuits against them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=227.88s)]
*  They don't want people to be engaged. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  They want people to be checked out. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=233.72s)]
*  That's why journalism is so important in this matter because journalism is a form of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=235.64s)]
*  education to, you know, give people a muscular sense of what they can do in this moment. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=239.48s)]
*  Adam Sauer's piece was fantastic because this is a war on knowledge, right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=244.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=248.04s)]
*  Our colleague Alex Wagner was in Hungary recently and she did a pretty compelling interview. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=248.68s)]
*  Let's watch some of the footage of that to discuss. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=254.92s)]
*  If you look at the state of this country, you see the effects of this corrupt governance. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=260.2s)]
*  I mean, our healthcare system is in a miserable state. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=265.08s)]
*  The education system is in a very bad state. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=267.8s)]
*  If you compare our country's economic growth to the countries in the region, it's lagging [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=271.56s)]
*  behind. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=276.68s)]
*  So if you would evaluate him by objective terms, you would see that- [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=277.32s)]
*  He's weak. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=281.8s)]
*  Yeah, he's weak. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=282.84s)]
*  Adam, what do you make of the comparisons between Hungary and America? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=284.92s)]
*  I kind of have a feeling the direction you're going to go in given your amazing piece, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=291.72s)]
*  but let's hear from you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=296.2s)]
*  Well, thank you for all the kind words. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, look, I would note that despite all the harm that Viktor Orbán has done to the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  prosperity of his own country, he's still in power. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=305.72s)]
*  So I think, you know, part of the issue there is if you do not have- [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=309.16s)]
*  If people are entirely reliant on propaganda from the regime or its allies, then it's very [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=312.76s)]
*  difficult to extract democratic accountability because the public cannot be informed as to what [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=319.24s)]
*  the administration is doing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=325.56s)]
*  And so I think you have to look at it in that light, specifically. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=327.8s)]
*  Trump said, I attack the media because I don't want any of my supporters to believe you. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=331.96s)]
*  Now, that applies to everything else. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  It applies to scientific institutions, medical institutions. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=339.08s)]
*  And so, you know, in the end, it would be a mistake to rely on some sort of backlash, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=343.24s)]
*  like Trump is going to do all this damage and then people will get mad and vote him out [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=347.8s)]
*  or vote Republicans out. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=351.24s)]
*  What they're going for here is a means to prevent people from exercising their democratic [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  self-determination because they don't have the information to do so. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=359.4s)]
*  So, Mishra, one of the things that is really interesting about all of this and kind of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=362.76s)]
*  connects it as well is their attack on DEI, right? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=369.08s)]
*  It's all- And Adam in his piece kind of talks about all of these different aspects of it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=372.04s)]
*  And on Truth Social yesterday, President Trump saying that he fired the director of the National [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=376.28s)]
*  Portrait Gallery because of DEI. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=381.24s)]
*  You also have this story in Axios about the White House rolling out what they called [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=384.92s)]
*  merit-based hirings, right? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=389.64s)]
*  So they're no longer going to use, in their eyes, DEI. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=391.4s)]
*  All of this is connected. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=394.35999999999996s)]
*  Do we really need this administration to lecture us about merit-based hiring? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=395.96s)]
*  I mean, really, do not lecture us about merit-based hiring because the hypocrisy is just so [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=401.56s)]
*  glaring, you know? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=407.88s)]
*  And it is interesting how DEI has been rolled back, that it has been demonized and then [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=409.32s)]
*  weaponized and then cauterized to use that to roll back actual progress. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=414.91999999999996s)]
*  We talked about the graduates. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=420.36s)]
*  This should have been their inheritance, inheriting a world that is as diverse in its leadership [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=422.12s)]
*  as it is in its composition. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=428.36s)]
*  And that is not what they are inheriting. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=431.16s)]
*  They have attacked DEI based on the idea that it discriminates against white people with [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=433.40000000000003s)]
*  absolutely no proof of that happening. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=440.2s)]
*  No proof at all. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=440.92s)]
*  And what is sad is the institutions- and in many cases, they're doing that to protect [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=442.36s)]
*  themselves, to inoculate themselves against legal redress. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=446.36s)]
*  But this is, again, I go back to Harvard saying, you know, Costco, for instance, saying, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  our values are not situational. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=455.4s)]
*  They will not be dictated by the present occupant of 1600. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=457.0s)]
*  Because Costco will be here after- [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=462.12s)]
*  Costco is doing just fine. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=463.64s)]
*  Correct. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=464.76s)]
*  You know, who's not doing fine? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=465.24s)]
*  Target. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=466.91999999999996s)]
*  Who did roll back their DEI and then black people protested and stopped going to Target. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=467.4s)]
*  So, you know, diversity is- the companies that support diversity that are staying with it, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=471.48s)]
*  the institutions are doing it not because of some sort of moral argument. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=476.59999999999997s)]
*  Let's be clear about that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=479.56s)]
*  They're usually doing it because it's good business. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=480.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=483.08s)]
*  They're usually doing it because they're trying to create the workforce that this country needs. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=483.4s)]
*  We should note that we are in the middle of an industrial revolution, although it's not [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=488.84s)]
*  necessarily based on industry. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=491.96s)]
*  It's based on technology. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=493.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=494.04s)]
*  In terms of climate change, in terms of AI, in terms of lithium batteries. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=494.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=497.88s)]
*  We are not necessarily advantaged in all of those fields. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=498.36s)]
*  And so when we attack knowledge, when we attack DEI, we are actually [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=501.32s)]
*  disadvantaged in the country that we live in and providing advantages to the countries [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=505.08s)]
*  that we're trying to compete with. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=509.88s)]
*  China, India, Israel, you know, and the creation of lithium batteries. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=511.0s)]
*  So this is, again, I'm going to call it Frederick Douglass, you know, who said that [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=515.88s)]
*  those who tried to- I'm going to get this wrong, but basically those who tried to oppress him [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=522.76s)]
*  actually suffered as much as he did. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=526.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=529.48s)]
*  And that's what's happening here. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=529.88s)]
*  This may make them feel good to create a class of people who, you know, have an easy [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=531.48s)]
*  pass through life. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=535.16s)]
*  It does not help America. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=536.28s)]
*  It does not help the rest of us. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=537.64s)]
*  And in the end, it actually does not help them. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=539.0s)]
*  Well, and look at Harvard. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=540.9200000000001s)]
*  Antonia is reporting what she was saying about how the students are so galvanized, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=541.88s)]
*  whereas previously they were fighting the administration. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  And now he basically is radicalizing a new generation of the best and the brightest. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=548.76s)]
*  Against him. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=554.76s)]
*  Against him. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAtICpkgbw&t=555.48s)]
