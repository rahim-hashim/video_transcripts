# ‘They are terrorizing communities’: Rep slams Trump immigration crackdown amid L.A. clashes
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw)
*  Joining us now is Illinois congresswoman Delia Ramirez. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=0.0s)]
*  She sits on the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=3.5s)]
*  Congresswoman, it's great to have you on the show. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=5.4s)]
*  We have a lot to cover. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=7.42s)]
*  I do want to start off with the breaking news that we're seeing this evening and certainly [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=8.42s)]
*  the escalatory rhetoric that we heard from the border czar Tom Homan threatening possibly [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=11.88s)]
*  to deploy the National Guard. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=17.32s)]
*  Give me your sense, just as you're watching this play out in two of America's largest [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=18.72s)]
*  cities, how concerned are you about the risk of escalation and your thoughts this evening [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=22.54s)]
*  about this? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=28.16s)]
*  What you're seeing is heartbreaking. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=30.16s)]
*  Frankly, you see no man. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=33.16s)]
*  Isis actions by the Trump administration is that they don't care if you're complaining [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=35.52s)]
*  with the law. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=39.8s)]
*  There are terrorizing communities and they're ambushing immigrants outside of courthouses, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=41.24s)]
*  restaurants, workspaces in Chicago, luring people in to dismiss court cases and then [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  literally pushing and throwing women mothers into these buses while their mass ICE agents [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=51.72s)]
*  are terrorizing people. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=58.08s)]
*  It's horrible to see what's happening and they're targeting particular cities, New York [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=60.04s)]
*  City, L.A., Chicago intentionally. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=64.36s)]
*  These are cities that have said that they are going to make sure that we're respecting [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=68.16s)]
*  the rule of law and that the president is not above the law. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=72.0s)]
*  And what you're seeing is a sick propaganda that is scaring communities around the country. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=75.72s)]
*  Congresswoman, what advice do you have for bystanders, for regular people who are watching [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=82.12s)]
*  these raids take place? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=89.2s)]
*  What should they be doing? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=92.4s)]
*  Should they be standing on the sidelines and recording? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=93.72s)]
*  Should they be trying to intercede? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=97.56s)]
*  What do you think the proper role for the public is at this point? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=100.84s)]
*  I think it's really difficult for people, right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=106.04s)]
*  Because Donald Trump said we are going to deport criminals. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=108.54s)]
*  We're going to do this. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=112.46s)]
*  We're going to do that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=113.46s)]
*  And what you're seeing is terrorizing communities, people who are working, mothers, four-year-old [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=114.46s)]
*  children who are being deported that are in cancer treatment. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=120.14s)]
*  And so the community, right, neighbors are so afraid that it is now the neighbor who [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=123.82s)]
*  is being taken, abducted. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=129.18s)]
*  And it's happening with ICE agents wearing masks, which is even actually scarier. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=131.46s)]
*  So of course, I would say to people, if you are in the area, please make sure to record, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=136.5s)]
*  report what you see. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  Some of these ICE agents are pushing, slamming people and then saying that it's the other [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  way around. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=147.86s)]
*  Make sure that we're getting footage. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  It is really difficult to watch what we're seeing because what we know from this administration [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=150.58s)]
*  and from Secretary Noe is that they have no respect for rule of law. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=155.86s)]
*  They have no respect for the courts. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=160.38s)]
*  And so people in the streets are doing what they can to stand and protect people. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=162.62s)]
*  And some of them is standing at a protest rally, ensuring that their neighbors are not [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  robbed from the community without due process. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=173.98s)]
*  Congresswoman, we have seen where there have been agents taking people. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=177.82s)]
*  They have been in plain clothes. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=183.94s)]
*  They're masked. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=185.89999999999998s)]
*  We have these irregular tactics. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=187.06s)]
*  What do you advise for, what concerns you the most about the tactics that are being [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=191.66s)]
*  used and how should people respond, frankly? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=196.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=202.01999999999998s)]
*  I mean, just think about that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=203.01999999999998s)]
*  You're leaving Walgreens, a store, and you see someone completely masked up. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  All of a sudden, they're taking someone. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=210.9s)]
*  How would you respond? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=213.14s)]
*  How do you know it's an ICE agent? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=214.54s)]
*  What operation is it? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=216.74s)]
*  They have these cards that are unmarked. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=218.3s)]
*  And if you are scared, you can go on Amazon, buy a t-shirt that says ICE. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=220.62s)]
*  The fear that you are hearing and feeling in every community around the country is palpable, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  which is why we have asked, Secretary Noem, why these tactics? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=231.54000000000002s)]
*  If what you're doing is correct and is rule of law and you have the authority to do, why [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=235.34s)]
*  are you using these tactics that truly create a sick propaganda? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=241.34s)]
*  The $200 million in taxpayer propaganda that has children not sleeping at night because [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=246.45999999999998s)]
*  they're afraid that mom will not be home when they get home is sick. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=251.73999999999998s)]
*  So I would say to you, a number of us, I serve in Homeland Security. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=255.77999999999997s)]
*  We continue to send letters asking, I want to know about these tactics. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=258.9s)]
*  What authority do you have? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=262.97999999999996s)]
*  The money that was authorized by Congress to protect and provide resources to refugees, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=264.74s)]
*  you are actually using it to send immigrants without due process to Guantanamo and Salvador, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=270.46s)]
*  who gave you that authority. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=275.70000000000005s)]
*  And I would say to you that as members of Congress, we have to assert our congressional [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=277.34000000000003s)]
*  authority in this moment. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=280.5s)]
*  We have to be able to visit these detention centers. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=282.06s)]
*  And attempting to scare us off the way they have done in New Jersey is unacceptable. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=284.90000000000003s)]
*  And we have to continue to do our responsibility, which is oversight in this precise moment [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=290.3s)]
*  where people are freaking out. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=295.38s)]
*  I have people asking me, Congresswoman, I am a United States citizen. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=298.42s)]
*  Do I have to walk around with my passport so that they don't abduct me too? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=303.26s)]
*  That is a fear that you're hearing right now. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  It's not just immigrants. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=309.18s)]
*  It is everyone who feels terrorized by these tactics. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=310.9s)]
*  And you're also the images we just want to tell viewers that they're seeing there from [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=315.26s)]
*  Paramount California appear to show tear gas canisters blowing down the street where these [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=318.06s)]
*  protests have been taking place throughout the course of the evening, certainly the afternoon [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=323.7s)]
*  in Los Angeles time. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=328.02s)]
*  So we'll certainly update you with more information as we get it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=329.86s)]
*  Congresswoman, let me get your thoughts on the development that happened yesterday. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=333.78s)]
*  And that was with the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and what that means for due process, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=337.26s)]
*  whether it is a victory for due process or not. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=343.78s)]
*  His attorney, Simon Sandoval Motionberg, said, quote, bringing him back for prosecution is [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=346.34s)]
*  an abuse of power, not justice. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=351.41999999999996s)]
*  And he added, due process means the chance to defend yourself before you are punished, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=353.58s)]
*  not after. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  Just give me your thoughts on the road to get him back into the United States and where [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=359.41999999999996s)]
*  his case goes from here and its implications. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=362.0s)]
*  Look, certainly for a number of us, we are grateful that he is back in the U.S., right, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=365.76s)]
*  where we will be able to fight for his due process in a way that you and I both know [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  at CICAD in El Salvador, we weren't able to. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=374.84s)]
*  Certainly, as colleagues of mine went to Salvador, it was difficult to really get a sense of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=378.12s)]
*  if was he OK, what was the deal there? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=383.24s)]
*  How was he treated? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=386.35999999999996s)]
*  And so it is important that he is back in the U.S., right. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=387.56s)]
*  And I would say complying with the Constitution, our laws, multiple court orders is the basic [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=390.92s)]
*  minimum that this administration needs to be doing. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=395.56s)]
*  But I think to the lawyer's point, what they're trying to do is make an example of Kilmar, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=398.44s)]
*  because they understand that the epitome of violation of due process is what we're seeing [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=404.6s)]
*  in his case. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=409.8s)]
*  And it's why we're going to have to do everything we can to ensure that the courts understand [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=410.92s)]
*  that this man deserves due process as anyone else does in this country. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=416.84s)]
*  And being here allows us to be able to push more for that than certainly we could have [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=421.56s)]
*  done in Salvador. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=426.2s)]
*  They said they couldn't bring him back, but now they're bringing him back to try to make [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=427.32s)]
*  an example out of him. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=430.28s)]
*  It's despicable. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=431.48s)]
*  ARI IMAHARA Congresswoman, before we let you go, can we just switch gears and talk about [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=432.28s)]
*  what is happening overseas and guys at the moment, you're introducing legislation to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=436.52s)]
*  block the bombs, an act known as Block the Bombs Act. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=441.8s)]
*  And I wanted to get your thoughts about that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=444.92s)]
*  Obviously, right now, what we're seeing overseas is heartbreaking. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=446.36s)]
*  There have been growing calls in the United States for the U.S. to stop providing arms [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=451.56s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=455.8s)]
*  Why did you decide to introduce this legislation? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=456.84000000000003s)]
*  What do you hope to accomplish with this legislation? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=459.64s)]
*  You have a U.S. Senator who's basically calling on the Israelis to attack a flotilla that [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=463.16s)]
*  is trying to deliver aid into Gaza. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=468.28000000000003s)]
*  ARI Yeah. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=471.0s)]
*  I mean, which is exactly why we need this legislation. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=473.24s)]
*  Look, the Netanyahu government is escalating a ground invasion and starving Palestinians. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=476.20000000000005s)]
*  Trump wants to take over the Gaza Strip so he can redevelop it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=480.68s)]
*  The two of these people, Netanyahu and Trump, are a lethal, unaccountable, extremist duo. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=484.36s)]
*  And I think Congress, in this precise moment, needs to assert its oversight authority. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=491.0s)]
*  That's why this bill is so important. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=495.96000000000004s)]
*  It's a bill that withholds a set of offensive weapons from Israel, and it demands that Israel [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=498.20000000000005s)]
*  be compliant with U.S. and international law when using these bombs. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=503.72s)]
*  Right now, Donald Trump is bypassing us to send those bombs, and we know what's happening. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=508.68s)]
*  They're bombing shelters with children in them. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=514.12s)]
*  And you and I both know that you cannot bomb ourselves to peace. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=517.72s)]
*  And we have senators, such as the ones that you're hearing from, talking about making [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=521.32s)]
*  sure they block the ability for people to get food is despicable, but also a demonstration [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=526.36s)]
*  that Netanyahu and some of my own colleagues are okay with using starvation as a weapon of war. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=533.64s)]
*  ARI Congresswoman Delia Ramirez, thank you so much. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=540.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX4FoAp3Ybw&t=556.28s)]
