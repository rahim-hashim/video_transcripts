# Elon Musk leaves murky legacy with DOGE
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34)
*  At a high level, you say, what is the goal of Dojo, or I think a significant part of the presidency, is to restore democracy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=0.0s)]
*  This may seem like, well, aren't we in a democracy? Well, if you don't have a feedback group, FKX, we'd have to... [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=10.4s)]
*  If you... Sorry. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=16.0s)]
*  This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=22.8s)]
*  Chainsaw! [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=27.0s)]
*  I am become meme. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=31.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=37.0s)]
*  Elon Musk has certainly left a mark on our federal government during his brief stint as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOJ. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=46.0s)]
*  Now Trump's first buddy is leaving the administration after more than 100 days with a little bruises. But is he really? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=55.0s)]
*  Many of the DOJ people, Elon, are staying behind you, so they're not leaving. And Elon's really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth, I think. I have a feeling. It's his baby, and I think he's going to be doing a lot of things. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=64.0s)]
*  Now long before Trump was sworn in, Musk boldly claimed DOJ would cut $2 trillion in government spending. I don't have to tell you how that has turned out. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=78.0s)]
*  As of now, the department's own website claims that it has saved taxpayers $170 billion, prompting Trump to ask the big question, quote, was it all BS? That is according to the Wall Street Journal. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=86.0s)]
*  What DOJ did do was cut people's jobs and livelihoods. The New York Times estimated more than 58,000 jobs were cut, with about 76,000 government workers taking buyouts. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=100.0s)]
*  Joining us now are the co-hosts of the I've Had It podcast, Angie Pumph, Sullivan, and Jennifer Welch. They are also co-authors of the book Life is a Lazy Susan of bleep sandwiches. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=112.0s)]
*  I can't say what the bleep is, but I'm sure you can figure it out. It's great to have both of you with us. Jen, I'll start with you on this one. Give me your take on what you think Elon Musk's legacy will be with DOJ. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=125.0s)]
*  I think Elon Musk's legacy after hopefully he goes to rehab, and I don't think we're talking about a 30-day stint here. I think we're looking at like a year inpatient. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=137.0s)]
*  But I think his legacy is going to be that he went into the federal government and found investigations into his companies, destroyed the evidence, and buried it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=148.0s)]
*  And that's my opinion, because he didn't save any money. I think it was all a ruse that he and Trump concocted. He said, look, I'll give you 300 million. You let me go shut down these investigations. They were both probably on their way to prison. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=159.0s)]
*  And that's just my opinion of why I think this whole thing happened. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=173.0s)]
*  I want to play some sound of Musk reacting or explaining away the black mark that appeared on his eye and then get your reaction after. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=178.0s)]
*  I was just walking around with the lex and I said, go ahead, punch me in the face. And he did. It turns out even a five-year-old punching you in the face actually. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=193.0s)]
*  That was X that did? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=201.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=202.0s)]
*  X could do it. If you knew X, he could do it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=203.0s)]
*  I didn't really feel much at the time. I guess it bruises up. But I just watched him around with the camera. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=205.0s)]
*  I didn't notice it actually. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=213.0s)]
*  So, Angie. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=214.0s)]
*  I just got to say, I have a six-year-old son and my six-year-old son has hit me a lot in the face. I have never, and I've gotten toy trucks thrown in my face. I've gotten tennis balls. I've gotten soccer balls. I've got a hockey stick. I've never gotten a bruise like that under my eye from my six-year-old son. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=216.0s)]
*  I think that's a challenge to your six-year-old son. That's what I'm hearing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=232.0s)]
*  Well, ladies, are you buying it? And if not, who did punch him in the face? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=235.0s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe Scott Besson. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=240.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did read some reports about Scott Besson. And you have the whole Stephen Miller, Stephen Miller's wife situation. I don't know, but nobody believes that little X did that, nor does it surprise anyone Trump didn't notice he had a huge black eye. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=243.0s)]
*  He does also have a number of romantic partners or I don't know. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=257.0s)]
*  Just partners. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=263.0s)]
*  I really don't know what you would call him. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=264.0s)]
*  But some of them are quite upset with him right now, including Grimes. So, you know, the mystery. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=267.0s)]
*  Baby Momma drama coming out his ears. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=273.0s)]
*  So we've heard a little bit about how Musk has advantaged Musk in some ways. I mean, in other ways, he's maybe destroyed a lot of value of Tesla. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=276.0s)]
*  But I want to talk a little bit about or hear your thoughts on what the enduring damage might be to the federal government. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=288.0s)]
*  Let's say another administration takes over and is not so Trumpy. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=297.0s)]
*  How difficult will it be to rebuild a lot of the institutions that have essentially been burnt to the ground? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=302.0s)]
*  I think what this Trump 2.0 has done has damaged the American brand. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=311.0s)]
*  The best economies in the world have the best governments in the world. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=317.0s)]
*  And right now we have one of the most corrupt governments in the world and the cascading effects of that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=321.0s)]
*  And over the course of 10 years, it's going to take so much to overcome that 77 million, 77 million Americans voted for this. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=328.0s)]
*  They knew he was convicted felon. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=339.0s)]
*  They knew that he all of the stuff he tried to talking about Hannibal Lecter, he tried to perform oral sex on a microphone on the campaign trail. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=342.0s)]
*  They saw it and they still voted for him. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=350.0s)]
*  So if I'm an investor or another country, I'm going to think half of their electorate is whacked out. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=353.0s)]
*  I don't know if we can do business with these people. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=358.0s)]
*  So I think the damage is going to go beyond the Trump administration because he has poisoned the well so bad with the right wing media cult personality cult that he has going on. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=360.0s)]
*  Let me read for you a little bit of something that you wrote in your book, because I think it's very fascinating to just the view from, you know, Oklahoma and elsewhere in America. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=371.0s)]
*  As a died in the World Democrat in a red state, I find myself in a lot of social situations in which I'm surrounded by deeply Christian, deeply red Republicans who are sounding off on topics like socialized health care of gay marriage. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=381.0s)]
*  I've learned that if you don't speak up in a red state, rights get taken away. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=394.0s)]
*  If you give these politicians an inch, they keep taking, they keep moving the goalposts further and further until the next thing you know, abortion is illegal and you're living in the handmaid's tail. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=398.0s)]
*  You know how how difficult is it to speak up in red America in deep red America about these issues and these points when you are constantly surrounded by people as you said, who don't see any of the flaws of Trump's policies, don't see any of the character flaws, don't see any of the double standards, the hypocrisy, the lies and are simply going along with everything in the in the mega cult. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=409.0s)]
*  I'll tell you one thing I think that Trump has done is he has made people worse than what they were before. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=434.0s)]
*  Like take Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz was horrible. I mean, awful. Everybody hated him and I didn't think it was possible for him to become worse. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=442.0s)]
*  And yet Trump emasculated him and he went from, you know, we will never vote for Donald Trump to God bless Donald Trump. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=451.0s)]
*  Well, that same thing that you see happening in the Beltway is happening in all across the United States. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=458.0s)]
*  And when you get to states like Oklahoma, Oklahoma, the one thing I wish Democrats would focus on is Trump has finally exposed these religious Republicans for the hypocrites that I always knew they were. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=464.0s)]
*  I always knew it was just this thin veneer of friendliness. And then underneath it, they're going to vote against gay rights. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=476.0s)]
*  They're going to vote against trans rights. They're going to vote for corporations. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=482.0s)]
*  They don't give crap about poor people, about health care, all of the things that the central character of their religion says that they should care about. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=485.0s)]
*  I always knew from living here they don't and they won't. They only care about capitalism and their mega church. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=493.0s)]
*  And so I wish the Democrats would use this to exploit and show, look, he has exposed all of them for the charlatan hypocrites that they are. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=502.0s)]
*  We have to fight back and we have to attack them right in the epicenter of their faith. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=513.0s)]
*  But the Democrats seem too scared to do that sometimes. And it really makes me angry. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=517.0s)]
*  Angie, Angie, in the book, you reflect back on Trump's White House victories and you write, we live in a purple city in a red state, yet we remain baffled by what happened in 2016 and shocked, appalled, saddened and terrified by the election results in 2024. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=522.0s)]
*  But maybe we aren't. Maybe this is America. How have you, your listeners and your readers, processed what is America right now, Angie? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=539.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, it was like two months of serious depression. And then you have to reconcile these people are intellectually cruel. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=550.0s)]
*  They want to be cruel on an intellectual level, and they also want to be cruel on an emotional level. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=561.0s)]
*  And that is hard to deal with. And we live in a blue city, so we'll have people whisper to us like, oh, we love your podcast. Keep doing what you're doing. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=566.0s)]
*  We don't want everybody, you know, everybody to think Oklahoma is all like that. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=574.0s)]
*  But the reality is, is these people have come out and they've been empowered to be more racist, homophobic, misogynist. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=579.0s)]
*  And that is particularly in a state like ours where women don't have as many rights as they do in other states in education, like our education system. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=586.0s)]
*  Now we're putting in the big lie in our textbooks. So you and we're 49th or 50th in education. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=596.0s)]
*  So you see the decline of America and people in Oklahoma think it's great. That's the problem. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=602.0s)]
*  You [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWyAPOZq34&t=626.0s)]
