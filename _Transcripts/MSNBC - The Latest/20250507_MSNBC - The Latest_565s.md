# 'The whole world is watching': 133 Cardinals gather for papal conclave
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM)
*  Let's get more now from NBC News international correspondent Molly Hunter at the Vatican, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=0.0s)]
*  Father Sam Sawyer, president and editor-in-chief of America Media, and Kathleen Sprouse Cummings, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=4.48s)]
*  professor of American Studies at University of Notre Dame and MSNBC Papal Analyst. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=9.84s)]
*  So, Molly, we are just on the cusp of this conclave. Walk us through what's happening right now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=15.44s)]
*  Ana, it is finally here. So we are just off St. Peter's Square, and I'm looking around. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  You can see huge crowds behind me, of course. The world's media also out here, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=28.16s)]
*  and people are coming down trying to figure out what's the timing, what's going on, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=32.64s)]
*  but this is nothing like what it's going to be in just a couple of hours. I'll walk you [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=37.2s)]
*  through the timing as we know it. Ana, you already mentioned that in the next kind of 15 minutes, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=40.64s)]
*  we're told that the 133 cardinal electors under the age of 80 will gather in the Pauline Chapel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=44.96s)]
*  There will be a prayer, and then they will process to the Sistine Chapel, and the Sistine [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Chapel is where all the action happens. Ana, during that procession, they will be singing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=54.08s)]
*  something called the Litany of Saints, and that scene is kind of the guiding hand that will help [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=58.64s)]
*  the cardinals choose the next leader of the Roman Catholic Church. Now, once inside, they will take [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=62.64s)]
*  that oath of secrecy. I know we'll get to that, but during this whole period of time, we will [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=68.32s)]
*  actually be seeing this on a live feed from Vatican TV. Once, though, extra omnesse, everybody out [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=72.48s)]
*  is declared, and the doors of the Sistine Chapel are closed, Ana. That is when the live pictures [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=78.48s)]
*  stop and all the action officially begins later today. What is the energy like there on the ground [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=84.0s)]
*  right now? I can only imagine the sense of anticipation. Yeah, Ana, we've been talking [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=89.36s)]
*  to people all day. We've been here all day, and people are excited. There's a little bit of kind [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=97.28s)]
*  of anxiety, I would say. We're already seeing kind of some different country flags flying, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=101.36s)]
*  but I'm told, and Ana, this is my first conclave that I've covered, I'm told that in a matter of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=106.0s)]
*  hours, as we get closer and closer to that smoke watch, there will be thousands and thousands of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=110.08s)]
*  people flags waving, eyes trained on that chimney, and that this is nothing compared to crowd sizes [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=115.2s)]
*  that we're going to see in just a couple hours. Yeah, they're going to be growing behind you as [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=120.72s)]
*  we continue throughout the morning here in the U.S. Kathleen, this is a day based on thousands of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=124.56s)]
*  years of history. Just how important of a day is it for these cardinals, but more importantly, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=130.8s)]
*  for the Catholic Church as a whole? It's certainly important for the cardinals. It must be weighing [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=135.84s)]
*  on them incredibly, but it's a day for the whole church, and really the whole world is watching. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=142.16000000000003s)]
*  We wish we were all in Rome, but our hearts and our eyes are on Rome watching this historic moment. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=148.72000000000003s)]
*  Yes, it is steeped in tradition, but there are some elements of this conclave that are new. It's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=153.28s)]
*  the largest one ever and the most diverse. Father Sawyer, in less than half an hour, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=157.84s)]
*  these cardinals are going to begin their walk to the Sistine Chapel to start this process where [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=163.52s)]
*  they're going to take that oath of secrecy. Talk to us about that. What's in the oath and why is [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=168.72s)]
*  the secrecy of this process so critical? So the oath is that they will not reveal to anyone [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=174.24s)]
*  outside the conclave what happens within or the voting, and really what it's designed to protect [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  is the ability of each cardinal to vote his own conscience, to vote for the man he believes [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=187.36s)]
*  is best suited to be the next pope in conscience. So the secrecy, though, is not just the oath. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=192.88000000000002s)]
*  There's also elaborate procedures around the way the ballots are cast and mixed in red to make sure [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=198.08s)]
*  that even the cardinals within the conclave can't tell who voted for whom inside the Sistine Chapel. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=203.12s)]
*  And why is it so important, that secrecy piece? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  I think really it's guaranteed to make sure that the cardinals are not coming under pressure. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=210.96s)]
*  You know, certainly over the course of the history of the church, we've had times where [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=217.36s)]
*  the papacy was seen as sort of a political prize to be won, where sometimes it was bestowed within [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=222.32s)]
*  families or, you know, there was financial or political pressure on it. So a lot of these [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=228.0s)]
*  regulations and these procedures around the conclave protect against that, but now in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=234.72s)]
*  contemporary circumstances, I think really what it preserves is the integrity of each cardinal [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=239.36s)]
*  in his own conscience, in his own prayer, figuring out where he thinks the spirit is really calling [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=244.56s)]
*  the next leader of the church to move, what kind of man we need, and what sort of issues he needs [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=250.08s)]
*  to pay the most attention to as he takes up the mantle of the successor of Peter. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  Kathleen, again, this is a process steeped in history, but also with some modern adjustments, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=260.32s)]
*  like the cell phones taken away. There are signal jammers. Can you tell us more about [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=265.76s)]
*  these modern-day changes for this conclave? It's really extraordinary. In a day and age when so [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=270.64s)]
*  little is secret, we know almost everything about everything and we find out in real time. Yes, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=276.96s)]
*  the procedures are dramatic, and we will probably find out eventually. They do take an oath of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=283.12s)]
*  secrecy, but news has a way of leaking out. We'll find out more shortly in time, but we won't know [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  anything for a long time about the dynamics and what is happening, what will happen inside the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=295.12s)]
*  Sistine Chapel in just a few hours. We know there's going to be that first vote today, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=300.0s)]
*  Molly, at least. That's the expectation. We've talked a little bit about the white smoke and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=305.44s)]
*  the black smoke. We'll be watching four on the outside, black smoke meaning no pope elected yet, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=310.4s)]
*  white smoke saying we have a pope. But what does the voting process look like inside the room? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=316.88s)]
*  Yeah, and Ana, I'll get to that in two seconds. I just wanted to share with our audience that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=325.6s)]
*  a loudspeaker just came over the hush crowd. Alex, what did they say? I'm just checking with my [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=328.96s)]
*  producer. They said that the procession is about to begin. So they're basically announcing, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=334.0s)]
*  Ana, there are huge screens up here right now. It shows the whole square, but they're announcing [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=338.64s)]
*  to the crowd what's about to begin. So I do think we're going to see these crowds grow [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=342.88s)]
*  as people come to watch the procession on those screens. As far as the voting, that's right, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=346.48s)]
*  black smoke. And it is very unlikely that a pope is chosen on this first vote. Black smoke means [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=351.36s)]
*  no pope. White smoke means there's been a two-thirds majority. And that voting inside, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=356.16s)]
*  we're told, happens very silently. I actually spoke with our NBC News Vatican analyst earlier this week [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=361.44s)]
*  on about kind of this past week, which is all politicking, all kind of lobbying and vote tallying [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  and subtle campaigning before they actually go inside. Take a listen to how he described kind of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=373.2s)]
*  the atmosphere in the final few hours before the conclave begins. Father Sawyer, as- [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=377.92s)]
*  What are these final hours like? We've mentioned- [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=383.2s)]
*  I think the final hours, there's a- what we're seeing is a lot of vote counting happening [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=385.04s)]
*  behind the scenes. There are certain cardinals that are, in a sense, whipping votes. I spoke to [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=389.12s)]
*  a cardinal yesterday who said to me, look, one of my jobs is to sort of figure out where the votes [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=394.56s)]
*  are going and which direction they're heading in and to say, have you considered this guy or have [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  you considered this guy? So there's a whip? Of course there's a whip. I mean, you know, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=403.76s)]
*  every U.S. senator looks in the mirror and thinks, I could be president one day perhaps. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=407.76s)]
*  Most cardinals think that as well at some point, or they at least think, I would like to see that [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=412.0s)]
*  guy as pope. So, Ana, what I thought was so interesting is all of that is happening during [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=416.0s)]
*  general congregations, especially in these final hours leading up to the actual conclave. But once [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=423.2s)]
*  inside, we are told there are no more speeches, no more campaigning, no lobbying, but it is time [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=427.92s)]
*  to put the cards on the table. And this first vote, even though we're not expecting necessarily [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=433.12s)]
*  to see that white smoke, is so significant, Chris says, and our other Vatican analysts explain as [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=437.12s)]
*  well, because the first time that cardinals are putting pen to paper, their cards are on their [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=442.16s)]
*  table, and they'll see internally who the frontrunners really are. Father Sawyer, and I'm sorry, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=446.32s)]
*  by the way, for stepping on the sound that Molly just tossed to. That was interesting to hear from [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=452.24s)]
*  Chris White. But Father Sawyer, you know, 133 cardinals from 70 different countries. This is [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=456.96s)]
*  the biggest, the most global conclave to date. How significant is that? And what do you see as [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=464.88s)]
*  the impact and how it might make this conclave play out a little differently? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think it's very significant. Certainly, you know, the numbers mean that whoever's elected [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=479.76s)]
*  pope will need ultimately 89 votes to get to the two-thirds mark, which is a huge number. And as [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=484.24s)]
*  far as we can tell, you know, in the conversation among journalists and what cardinals have been [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=490.56s)]
*  willing to say during this last week and a half, no one's anywhere near close to 89 on the way into [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=494.72s)]
*  the conclave. So this first vote really will establish sort of what the possibilities are [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=500.32s)]
*  for the cardinals within the chapel. But I think that the great diversity, the way Francis expanded [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  the college and particularly the way he brought in cardinals from places that had never had [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=510.96s)]
*  cardinals before, it's really going to bring in a number of different priorities that we haven't [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  necessarily seen enter the conclave before. So concerns about how the church is doing in the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=520.48s)]
*  peripheries, concerns about climate change or about issues of poverty that really are central [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=525.68s)]
*  in this conclave, maybe in a way that they haven't been before. Okay, much more of our [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=532.88s)]
*  conclave coverage still just ahead. Molly Hunter, thank you. Father Sam Sawyer and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=537.36s)]
*  Kathleen Spro's Cummings. Please stay close. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SrIIImEdM&t=541.6800000000001s)]
