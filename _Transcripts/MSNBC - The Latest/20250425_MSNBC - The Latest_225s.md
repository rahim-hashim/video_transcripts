# Trump 'going far beyond' just deporting criminals: WaPo Reporter
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8)
*  52 past the hour this morning we're getting new reaction to the Trump administration's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=0.0s)]
*  immigration crackdown. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=3.68s)]
*  An Associated Press pullout today shows 48% of Americans think President Trump's deportation [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=5.08s)]
*  policies have gone too far. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  It comes as a federal judge in California blocked President Trump's effort to halt federal [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=13.26s)]
*  funding for sanctuary cities. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=17.86s)]
*  Joining us now is Sabrina Rodriguez, national political reporter for the Washington Post. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Sabrina, it's always a treat to see you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=24.28s)]
*  What is the significance of this move by the judge? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=26.52s)]
*  I mean, I think it's very significant to see this is not just one action. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=29.44s)]
*  We're seeing judges, I mean the orders are piling up against the Trump administration's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=33.88s)]
*  immigration policy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=38.64s)]
*  This is something that Trump has wanted to do for years. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=40.04s)]
*  This is something he attempted to do in his first term because he's always had, you know, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=43.04s)]
*  he's always attacked sanctuary cities and, you know, focused on them very much and these [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  jurisdictions and saying, well, they need to be cooperating with federal immigration [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=51.44s)]
*  enforcement. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=55.2s)]
*  To see this come down this way again, again shows, of course, the power of the courts [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=56.28s)]
*  here in blocking something that, you know, again, we see he's going to be pushing and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=60.68000000000001s)]
*  we're going to see appeals and we're going to see this still work its way through the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=64.64s)]
*  courts but it is an initial blockage of something that he already wanted to put into place. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  And a new Washington Post ABC Ipsos poll shows that a majority of those polled now disapprove [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  of the president's immigration crackdown compared with the majority approving just back in February. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=78.28s)]
*  What has changed, Sabrina? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=83.78s)]
*  I mean, I think it's people really seeing exactly what this looks like. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=85.36s)]
*  You know, when we were talking in February, it was just a few weeks into the Trump administration, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=88.18s)]
*  people were still going off of what he had promised on the campaign trail and talking [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=93.04s)]
*  to a lot of voters last year and folks who did go ahead and vote for Donald Trump, a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=96.82000000000001s)]
*  lot of people said, well, he's just going to focus on criminals or, oh, you know, it [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=100.82s)]
*  is going to be an orderly process that's necessary after what was perceived to be a chaos at [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=104.66s)]
*  the border. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=109.42s)]
*  But now what we're starting to see is more and more headlines piling up of people that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=110.42s)]
*  have been deported without due process. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  We're seeing more headlines about just the chaotic nature of this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=116.97999999999999s)]
*  And we're seeing that he is going far beyond just deporting criminals, as some people thought [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=120.34s)]
*  was going to be the focus of all of this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=125.42s)]
*  I mean, even though during the campaign he was very clear that he wished to create the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  largest deportation force in American history, that would mean a lot of things. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=132.16s)]
*  And so the surprise to many is almost a question because he was very clear about this. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=138.38s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=146.42s)]
*  I think the interesting thing, though, is that is sort of a piece of the persona of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=147.42s)]
*  Donald Trump, though, is a lot of people who support him and a lot of people who ultimately [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=151.14s)]
*  voted for him any of the three times or all three times, something about him is that people [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=154.92s)]
*  sort of select the pieces of what he says. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  Since he talks so much and he comes out and he makes these sweeping promises and he says, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=162.54s)]
*  I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that, a lot of people say, well, that piece, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=167.34s)]
*  he's not actually going to do that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=171.46s)]
*  No, really, he's going to do this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=172.86s)]
*  And that's sort of where now he finds himself, where he made a lot of sweeping promises, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=174.66s)]
*  not just on immigration, but on issues across the board. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=178.86s)]
*  And now it's how exactly do you hold him to it when he said one thing one day and another [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=182.06s)]
*  thing another day. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=186.22s)]
*  So, yeah, you know, of the many things that I've told you this and I'm proud of you for, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=187.22s)]
*  one of the most important ones is that you're from La Ciudad Que Progresa. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  Very proud to be from Hialeah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=197.58s)]
*  Me too. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=198.58s)]
*  I just, we love it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=199.58s)]
*  Shout out to Hialeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=200.58s)]

*  Always. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=202.58s)]
*  Gracias, Sabrina. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=203.58s)]
*  Muchísimas gracias. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_Yrp_crX8&t=204.58s)]
