# Newsom reacts to federal court's ruling against Trump's National Guard use in L.A. | Full Speech
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc)
*  Governor Newsom is speaking right now after a federal judge ruled against the Trump administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=0.0s)]
*  ordering Trump to return control of the National Guard to Newsom. Let's listen. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=4.32s)]
*  Those cornerstones that he claimed are asserted were not met. Section 12, 406, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=9.28s)]
*  clearly there's no invasion, there's no rebellion. It's absurd. And so we're gratified. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=16.88s)]
*  Today is a big day for the Constitution of the United States, for our democracy, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=25.28s)]
*  and I hope it's the beginning of a new day in this country where we push back against overreach, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=31.28s)]
*  we push back against these authoritarian tendencies of a president that has pushed the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=39.36s)]
*  boundaries, pushed the limit, but no longer can push this state around any longer. Happy to take [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=45.04s)]
*  any questions. I hope we look at what happened to Senator Padilla, not through the blue or [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=51.92s)]
*  red lens, but through your own set of eyes. And just tell me that that's right. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=63.44s)]
*  Here is the United States Senator in his home state in a federal building, in his office building [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=71.44s)]
*  that wishes to join a press conference, not this summer list, and express himself by simply asking [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=80.16s)]
*  a question. And was handcuffed, was thrown down to the ground at the United States Center. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=87.12s)]
*  And anyone that knows Alex Padilla knows one thing about Alex Padilla. He's one of the most [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=93.44s)]
*  mild mannered, decent people you'll meet. And that's not, don't just take my word for it. Folks on [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=97.6s)]
*  the other side of the aisle would acknowledge that. I thought it was a disgrace. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=103.12s)]
*  I want to make this clear. The National Guard will come back under my authority by noon tomorrow. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=109.36s)]
*  The National Guard will be redeployed to what they were doing before Donald Trump commandeered them. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=120.8s)]
*  The National Guard will go back to border security, working on counter drug enforcement and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=127.28s)]
*  fentanyl enforcement, which they were taken off by Donald Trump. The National Guard will go back [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=134.0s)]
*  to working on what we refer to as the rattlesnake teams doing vegetation and forest management, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=139.6s)]
*  which Donald Trump took them off in preparation for wildfire season. The National Guard, men and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=145.92s)]
*  women will go back to their day jobs, which include law enforcement, that he took them off the job. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=152.4s)]
*  I just want you to all absorb what I just said. By the way, you don't have to absorb it. You'll have an [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  opportunity to review that in the 36 page order from Justice Breyer that laid that out. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  And they'll come back under the rightful command of the Governor of the State of California. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  Do it peacefully. It's a vulgar display. It's the kind of thing you see Kim Jong-un, you see it [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=176.08s)]
*  Putin, you see it with dictators around the world that are weak and just want to demonstrate [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=182.4s)]
*  strength. Weakness masquerading as strength. Defective power, as we call it, is a weakness. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=190.0s)]
*  And just want to demonstrate strength. Weakness masquerading as strength. To [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=198.56s)]
*  fit the dear leader on his birthday, what an embarrassment. Honestly, it's about as small as [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=205.84s)]
*  it gets. How weak, how weak do you have to be to commandeer the military to fit you on your birthday [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=214.32s)]
*  in a vulgar display of weakness? That's Donald Trump. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=224.56s)]
*  Well, these governors have all been waiting for this decision. I haven't had a chance to talk to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=236.72s)]
*  any governors. And by the way, every Republican governor, I remember one of them by the name of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=240.96s)]
*  Kristi Noem, who just a few months ago was on there with one of the spokespeople for the Trump [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=247.04s)]
*  administration, Sean Hannity, and was going on and on and on about a rumor that somehow former [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=252.24s)]
*  President Biden was going to federalize her national troop. And she stood there talking about [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=260.56s)]
*  freedom, federalism, the 10th Amendment. And here she is, you know, her folks throwing the United [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  States Center from the great state of California on the ground and handcuffing it in his office [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=277.52s)]
*  building in 2025. Governor, what about the Mauritians? Were you disappointed the judge [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=284.08s)]
*  prior when you addressed that issue? Is that something that you expected to develop? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=289.76s)]
*  Well, there's been a lot of rhetoric from Pete Hedzik, that's his name, that they've quote [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=293.12s)]
*  unquote been deployed. But it doesn't appear they have been. But they were making you believe that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=300.4s)]
*  And so I think the judge was waiting for the evidence that they actually have been deployed [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=306.56s)]
*  into Los Angeles, which they appear not to be. Of course, they're not coordinating with anybody [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  on this. So he's just waiting for that evidence. Obviously, they moved to another location for [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  training exercises. But there's a bottom line. The police do policing. Military, it's for the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=325.76000000000005s)]
*  battlefield. The idea that these unbelievably brave young men and women that I work with, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=332.32s)]
*  that we have had the benefit of their extraordinary contribution all across this state. I gave you [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  three examples. What more evidence do we need of the work they did for the wildfires in Los Angeles [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=346.48s)]
*  and all the work they did to secure locations and keep property and personal life safe over [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=351.6s)]
*  the course of the last few months? These folks are now being commandeered to do ice raids. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=358.8s)]
*  You've seen the photographs. That ends tomorrow at noon. And the notion that the United States [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  active duty Marines, these heroes would be used to militarize the streets of an American city [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  is an abomination. Founding fathers do not live and die to see that happen in this country for no [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=385.92s)]
*  reason whatsoever than vanity, theater, to instill fear, to incite a response. So I'm very hopeful [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=395.12s)]
*  this order puts that in perspective and hopefully Donald Trump will immediately back down. The courts [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  have ruled on the guard. They will be back under my command and he'll be relieved. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=418.0s)]
*  Donald Trump will be relieved of his command at noon tomorrow. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  You mentioned that you tried to work with the president in the past. Has this situation changed your dynamic? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=438.08s)]
*  No, because I will work with anyone to advance the interests of 40 million Americans that I happen to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=444.24s)]
*  represent here in California. And so I've always maintained an open hand, not a closed fist. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=451.84s)]
*  But I also am going to stand firm and tall and push back against lawlessness against someone [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=457.68s)]
*  that does not believe in the rule of law, does not believe in constraints, does not believe in the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=465.20000000000005s)]
*  constitution, who is threatening judges, that threatens not to abide by orders and Donald Trump [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=469.20000000000005s)]
*  better abide by these orders. Or we have a constitutional crisis, likes of which we haven't [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=476.8s)]
*  seen in our lifetime. Well that will be determined by fate in future, but also fundamentally by [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=485.12s)]
*  whatever decision he makes. That's how things break down. It's a federal judge with a federal [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=493.12s)]
*  order, period, full stop. It's the rule of law. These are the foundational principles of a constitutional [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=501.76s)]
*  democracy. He must work under the constraints as a constitutional officer of the constitution of [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=511.2s)]
*  the United States of America. That's what this court order demands of the president of the United [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=520.08s)]
*  States. He is not a monarch, he is not a king, and he should stop acting like one. Governor, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=526.0s)]
*  when was the last time you spoke to the president? I spoke to him on Friday night. He had a mysterious [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=531.2s)]
*  conversation with me three days later. You can't even make this stuff up. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  Do you have a readout? Oh I would love to share the readout, but I revere the office of presidency, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=542.08s)]
*  so I'll keep it in confidence. He is quite literally made up components of that conversation. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=552.96s)]
*  He's been a stone cold liar about what he said we talked about. He never discussed the National [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=560.08s)]
*  Guard, period, full stop. I would love to share with you what he actually talked about. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=567.04s)]
*  It would send shivers up your spine. Attorneys for the government though today seem to imply that [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  that Friday call, that you might have been aware that this was coming or can you allude, can you [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=577.04s)]
*  confirm whether or not you knew that this was coming, this order was coming? Of course not, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=584.3199999999999s)]
*  no absolutely not. We were back and forth with Susie Wiles as chief of staff and then called [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=588.56s)]
*  mayor of Los Angeles. Saw a missed call from the president, called him back. I actually texted him [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=594.0s)]
*  back, you want full disclosure, and he called me right back. We discussed for a nanosecond [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=599.28s)]
*  Los Angeles and he immediately zigged and zagged into seven or eight other topics. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=605.76s)]
*  Some extraordinarily familiar and some extraordinarily remarkable considering the world [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=610.16s)]
*  we're living in. So how did you find out? I learned about it when I saw some tweet about [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=616.8s)]
*  Governor Newscum, a nickname by the way that's hardly original. There was an eighth grader [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=622.1600000000001s)]
*  on Baltimore Street in Cordo Madera that used to call me that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=631.2s)]
*  And the reference to the National Guard being commandeered in that same tweet. That's how I [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=635.6800000000001s)]
*  learned about it. Governor, are you confident you will stand on appeal especially against this [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  report? Well I'm confident in the rule of law, I'm confident in the constitution of the United [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=645.2800000000001s)]
*  States, I'm confident in the wisdom and judgment of a very well-respected federal judge, and I'm [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=648.64s)]
*  confident on the basis of the review of the 36 pages absolutely it will stand. Governor, does this [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=657.1999999999999s)]
*  order go even further than you expected? I think your attorneys had asked for them to simply be [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=663.68s)]
*  restricted to federal buildings. I'll just say we're extraordinarily pleased by the 36-page rolling [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=668.4s)]
*  of Justice Breyer. Can you speak to some of the journalists who have been about some of the [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=675.04s)]
*  journalists in LA who have been hit with rubber bullets? Well there's two investigations, the one [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=678.9599999999999s)]
*  we initiated with the California Highway Patrol and there's one that has been initiated independent [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=685.04s)]
*  by the LAPD and people should feel safe, reporters absolutely should feel safe, and we'll get to the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=691.36s)]
*  bottom of it. I don't want to prejudge but I'm concerned about them. That's why we advanced the [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=699.1999999999999s)]
*  investigations. Governor, today in San Francisco immigration attorneys tell us that there were [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=704.08s)]
*  three additional folks who were detained while heading into the high-support offices on Sansom. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=708.48s)]
*  This is some of just many detentions we've seen at court houses and immigration offices in the [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=715.0400000000001s)]
*  Bay Area around the state and many of these people, their attorneys are telling us they've [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=720.5600000000001s)]
*  complicated technical cases. What are your thoughts about seeing these detentions occurring in your [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=725.12s)]
*  communities around California? Well he's on, let's just dispense, this is not about criminals. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=731.6s)]
*  If it's about criminals, got no beef with me. We want to secure a border, we need comprehensive [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=738.16s)]
*  immigration reform, we need a pathway to citizenship for people being in our 10, 15, 20 years contributing, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=746.8000000000001s)]
*  paying their taxes, being remarkable members of our community, but that's not what this is about. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=752.88s)]
*  I was in Oxnard, California in Ventura County yesterday, met with three people, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=759.04s)]
*  three people directly impacted by indiscriminate raids. I met a 12-year-old boy in sixth grade, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=764.16s)]
*  weeping, crying, tears pouring down his face. His mother and father were both detained, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=773.04s)]
*  they disappeared. He has no brothers, no sisters, no family. He quite literally is on his own [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=781.52s)]
*  abandoned. That's Donald Trump's America. 20 plus years his mom and dad working in the same fields, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=788.64s)]
*  doing the same packing and shipping. 20 plus years they've disappeared. 12-year-old boy, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=796.56s)]
*  you saw the images of ICE officers running through strawberry fields, CBP, helicopters above. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=805.04s)]
*  I met a woman, a single mother, who was walking out at 5 45 a.m. to get in her car. Seven agents [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=811.8399999999999s)]
*  surrounded her. They took her in a car, in essence kidnapping her, driving around for almost two hours [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=819.6s)]
*  until she finally convinced the agent because she has three young children, a 16-year-old, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=827.28s)]
*  a 14-year-old, and an eight-year-old that they needed to get to school and there's no one to [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=832.56s)]
*  help them get to school. She was finally allowed to call her oldest daughter, who was interrogated [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=837.28s)]
*  by the agent and threatened. And they threatened her after they dropped her off, said, we may be back. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=842.72s)]
*  Terrorizing, this single mother. No criminal record, no criminal background. I met another [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=849.52s)]
*  young woman whose husband has quite literally disappeared. No criminal record. She doesn't know [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=856.64s)]
*  what to do. She doesn't even know what happened. That was just yesterday. That's the day. She [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=861.6s)]
*  was just yesterday. That's Donald Trump's America. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=866.24s)]
*  Agricultural workers. Think about that when you have dinner tonight. Think about what, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=871.6800000000001s)]
*  didn't you enjoy your first course? Have some fresh fruit, some fresh vegetables. Who provided [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=876.16s)]
*  those? Who supported you in that? Think about it when you go home and the construction around [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=881.84s)]
*  your property. Maybe you're getting a remodel. Who's doing that work? Destroying not only the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=886.64s)]
*  foundations of our democracy, the best again of the Roman Republic and Greek democracy, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=893.04s)]
*  but now our economy is at risk because of the recklessness and the cruelty of Donald Trump, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=898.56s)]
*  the indiscriminate cruelty of Donald Trump. Why else do you go to a 7-Eleven? Why else do you go [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=904.7199999999999s)]
*  to a nail salon? Why else do you just randomly show up in front of a hardware store? Why else? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=912.0799999999999s)]
*  It's not about criminals. That's about creating chaos. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=919.84s)]
*  And I do not believe the American people, the majority of the American people, support that. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=926.1600000000001s)]
*  Quite the contrary. And so this decision was important because it's about constraints. It's [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=929.84s)]
*  about limits. It's about our democracy. And that's why we're very grateful by the order. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=936.24s)]
*  Do you think the courts will, I think that's, look, I'm counting on these separations of power. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=943.6s)]
*  It's the co-equal branches of government, co-equal, Mr. President, branches of government. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=954.08s)]
*  He's eliminated one or they eliminated themselves. That's called Congress. Speaker Johnson, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=961.0400000000001s)]
*  who his eloquence was elevated when he called to quote unquote, tarn feather the governor [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=966.8000000000001s)]
*  of California. That's the speaker. Very religious man. I guess that's the spirit. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=972.96s)]
*  The word of the Lord. He's abdicated any oversight and responsibility over the [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=983.76s)]
*  President of the United States. There's one branch remaining and that's the judicial branch. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=992.48s)]
*  So my response to you is we count on the judicial branch. But there's also, as I said, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=997.2800000000001s)]
*  I ended that speech 48 hours ago. I said there's the most important office and that's office of [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1002.96s)]
*  citizen. That's all of you stepping up, stepping in and sharing your passion with action, pushing [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1008.0s)]
*  back against this peacefully, peacefully and sharing your voice. And I think this weekend [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1016.1600000000001s)]
*  there will be millions and millions of Americans rightfully expressing their outrage, their [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1024.96s)]
*  constitutionally protected right to assemble and free speech, peacefully expressing that all [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1030.4s)]
*  across this country. I pray that's the case. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1037.44s)]
*  No, not at this moment. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1046.64s)]
*  Governor, what do you make of the President today coming out and saying he wants to protect California farm workers from deportation given what you... [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1048.4s)]
*  This is what he does. He creates a problem and then he tries to be a hero in his own Marvel movie. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1055.6000000000001s)]
*  Did it on Ted. Fill in a blank on almost every topic, creates the problem and then tries to do a make-believe [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1064.24s)]
*  as if you're all perfect little sheep and you're going to go on with it to be the hero in his own Marvel movie. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1072.24s)]
*  He initiated those raids. He significantly increased the scale and scope of those raids. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1083.6s)]
*  That's why he wants the National Guard. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1089.92s)]
*  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of guards, men and women now being dispersed everywhere, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1094.16s)]
*  Sprinter vans, unmarked, people with masks running in, rolling over, some case running in to cars, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1098.4s)]
*  six-month-old kid, a three-year-old child in the back of the car, left. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1108.24s)]
*  So spare me, Mr. President, that he's sincere. But if he is, that happened because of you, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1117.92s)]
*  it happened because of the American people because they stood up and that should give us some optimism. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1126.0s)]
*  Thank you all very, very much. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMs48Qp_rc&t=1131.28s)]
