# Trump set to deliver joint address to Congress
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY)
*  President Trump is set to give a joint address to Congress tomorrow, where he's expected [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=0.0s)]
*  to tout what he believes are his early second-term successes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=4.72s)]
*  According to two sources, Trump circulated his speech among top advisers this weekend, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=8.4s)]
*  along with taking part in some prep. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=12.6s)]
*  The president is expected to focus on his administration's work on immigration, elimination, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=14.8s)]
*  eliminating diversity inclusion programs, tariffs and budget cuts executed by Doge during [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=19.2s)]
*  his address. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=24.92s)]
*  After the speech, Trump is set to stay in Washington and amplify his message from the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=26.0s)]
*  White House rather than travel the country, as is typical after a joint address. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=29.840000000000003s)]
*  Vice President J.D. Vance, however, is expected to take his place to highlight the administration's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=34.040000000000006s)]
*  message on the road. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=38.800000000000004s)]
*  Joining us now, White House correspondent for The Hill, Alex Gangitano. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=40.56s)]
*  Alex, talk a little bit about what we're expecting from this address. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=43.88s)]
*  We just laid out some of the obvious highlights, but what else? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=47.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think he'll be touting just a lot of the accomplishments. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=50.32000000000001s)]
*  We've heard them say time and time again that this last month was the most successful month [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=53.279999999999994s)]
*  in presidential history for a first return to the White House in this case. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=58.0s)]
*  But I think it's going to be a lot of patting themselves on the back for things like these [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=64.28s)]
*  mass deportation plans. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=68.24s)]
*  You mentioned immigration is going to be a focus of this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  Ending DEI policies, that's such a big talking messaging point for Republicans. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=72.44s)]
*  But I also think a lot is going to be about Doge, because this is something the president [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=76.88s)]
*  has defended. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=80.64s)]
*  He's proud of he brought Elon Musk into his cabinet meeting last week. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=82.12s)]
*  I think he wants to talk about it and he also wants to kind of defend it in the sense of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=86.68s)]
*  there are some members of Congress who are skeptical about these cuts, about some of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=91.0s)]
*  their constituents losing jobs, about where the money from these cuts are going to go. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=95.44s)]
*  Is it going to go back to taxpayers? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=100.08s)]
*  It's going to go to the deficit. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=101.52s)]
*  I think he has to answer some of those questions. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=102.52s)]
*  And then, of course, it goes without saying, I think there'll be some fireworks. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=104.72s)]
*  I think there'll be some big announcements. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=107.36s)]
*  I mean, he hasn't not made news in any of these big moments in the last six weeks. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=108.84s)]
*  Yeah, and tariffs certainly expected to be among those potential announcements as we [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=113.64s)]
*  wait to see what he does in regards to China's already existing tariffs, but then also in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=117.88s)]
*  regards to Canada and Mexico. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  But I think with Trump, when we talk about trumpeting of achievements, it doesn't seem [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=124.84s)]
*  like this is going to be a speech that even tries to play the unity card, which Trump [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  has tried to play in the past. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=133.4s)]
*  And even we saw it on display during the inauguration. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=134.64s)]
*  Sure, the initial remarks might have extended some kind of an olive branch, but then he [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=137.16s)]
*  made very divisive and controversial remarks minutes later downstairs in a different part [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=141.23999999999998s)]
*  of the Capitol. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  So it seems like they're maybe not even trying this time. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=149.16s)]
*  I don't think there'll be any part of this remarks that has Hakeem Jeffries leaving the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=150.16s)]
*  room saying, I want to help prevent a government shutdown with these folks. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=154.04s)]
*  Now, I think it's going to be a lot of Republicans are leading the way. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  We're doing all the right things and we're taking on these culture wars. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  And I think that's something that's going to frustrate a lot of Democrats is the idea [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=164.44s)]
*  that these culture wars are what Republicans care about the most. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=167.88s)]
*  Whereas they're trying to figure out ways that they could work with Republicans in a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=172.88s)]
*  bipartisan way. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=176.4s)]
*  We're also going to probably hear him, you know, take some jabs at former President Biden, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=177.56s)]
*  things like that, that the president loves doing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=182.72s)]
*  That's just not messages of unity. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=185.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=187.4s)]
*  The other question I have is why is he not taking the show on the road? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=188.4s)]
*  This is a guy who loves to be in that rally environment, arguably sometimes more than [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=190.76s)]
*  he enjoys his time in the Oval Office. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  At least that was true, seemingly in the first term. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=196.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's something we've been wondering for weeks. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=199.2s)]
*  I mean, his supporters love seeing him, as you mentioned, you know, at these rallies. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  That's where he shines. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=204.72s)]
*  That's where his people want to see him. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=206.0s)]
*  And he's been between the White House and Florida back and forth. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  And so he really hasn't had these campaign style rallies that he loved doing in his first [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=212.14s)]
*  term when he was the city and president and not necessarily campaign the whole time. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=217.44s)]
*  You know, it is a tradition, like you said, to go on the road. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=222.0s)]
*  But he really has been keeping this cadence of I'm in Washington, I'm working hard, I'm [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=225.96s)]
*  talking to the press every day from the Oval Office as I sign executive orders. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=230.08s)]
*  And I guess he wants to keep that balance. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=234.6s)]
*  We'll see if in the summer he decides to hit the road. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  Letting JD Vance be the messenger on the road, at least for now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=239.56s)]
*  I know that the speech is likely to be domestically focused and yet so much happening on the world [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=242.92s)]
*  stage. What do you think the way that he talks about Ukraine and Russia? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=247.84s)]
*  How do you think that manifests? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=251.92s)]
*  I imagine that's going to be a flash point. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=253.4s)]
*  Right after that explosive meeting on Friday with Ukrainian President Zelensky, I think [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=255.64s)]
*  there'll be a lot of also him saying, I put America first. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=259.6s)]
*  I made Republicans who have been skeptical about Ukraine funding under the Biden administration [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=263.44s)]
*  happy by questioning Zelensky and if he was thankful enough, I actually think it's going [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=269.04s)]
*  to be a rallying point for him with Republicans. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=273.48s)]
*  Yeah, it very likely could be with Republicans. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=275.68s)]
*  Although as we started the show, there are some Republicans willing to say this is not [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=278.04s)]
*  the way that we should talk about our friends and our allies, especially not Ukraine. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=282.12s)]
*  We will see all eyes on where that relationship goes next. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=286.32000000000005s)]
*  White House correspondent for The Hill, Alex Gensitano. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=289.12s)]
*  Thank you, as always. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=291.36s)]
