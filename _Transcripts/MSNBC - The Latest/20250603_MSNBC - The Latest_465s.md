# Trump Administration hired a staffer working with Stephen Miller to wage war with Harvard
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY)
*  of the Trump administration's retribution campaign against Harvard University, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=0.0s)]
*  another independent student-run law journal on campus, stunning revelations about how the Trump [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=4.32s)]
*  administration is wielding power to punish its perceived enemies and impose its political agenda. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=9.84s)]
*  New York Times is reporting this. Quote, the Justice Department quietly approached Harvard [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=16.0s)]
*  University last month with startling claims and signaled that it was reviewing claims of discrimination [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=21.2s)]
*  against white men at the Harvard Law Review and accused the renowned publication of destroying [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=26.96s)]
*  evidence in an open investigation. Quote, in a series of letters that have not been previously [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=32.08s)]
*  reported, the government also disclosed that it had a, quote, cooperating witness inside the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=37.04s)]
*  student-run journal. That witness now works in the White House under Stephen Miller, the architect [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=42.72s)]
*  of the administration's domestic policy agenda, Trump officials confirmed. Quote, the witness, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=48.56s)]
*  Daniel Wasserman, was identified as a government cooperator in two of the letters to Harvard [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=54.4s)]
*  University from the Justice Department last month when he was still an editor at the Harvard Law [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=59.76s)]
*  Review. Joining our conversation is New York Times correspondent Michael Bender. He's bylined on that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=64.64s)]
*  reporting we just read from. Amanda, Barb and Miles are still with us. This seems wild, Michael Bender. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  Take us through what you're reporting. Yeah, this has been one of the more remarkable stories, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=77.6s)]
*  I think, in this entire saga from Trump, his assault on academia, mostly, most recently on Harvard. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=84.08s)]
*  I think this is, you know, whether it's sort of the, his deportation policy or his terror policy [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=92.88s)]
*  or these attacks on higher education, the Trump administration has prioritized speed and shock [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=100.24s)]
*  value first and foremost. And what this story does, I think, is sort of shows the risks and the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=108.48s)]
*  rewards of that kind of shoot-first mentality. You mentioned there is a cooperating witness for the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=114.48s)]
*  Department of Justice who works in the White House. It is not clear to me that the White House knew he [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  was a cooperating witness when the Justice Department hired him. It's not clear to me that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  the Justice Department knew he was working in the White House or interviewing with the White House [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=135.28s)]
*  when they started working with him on his case. And that has led to, as you can imagine, a lot of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=140.0s)]
*  complications in this investigation. On the other hand, the administration did extract some [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=146.24s)]
*  concessions out of the Harvard Law Review. Now, this is a student-run publication that doesn't have [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=154.32s)]
*  any, is independent of Harvard and doesn't receive any federal funding. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=159.6s)]
*  And it was fairly extraordinary that they got involved at the law review on behalf of this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=165.44s)]
*  student in the first place. But the law review did decide to revoke some disciplinary action [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=171.28s)]
*  against this student for downloading documents in violation of their privacy policy. And [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=177.12s)]
*  they've largely moved away from their requests of him to stop disseminating those documents. Maybe [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=183.76s)]
*  not a big deal in and of itself, but where the Trump administration is concerned, even those small [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  things are viewed as big victories inside the administration. Michael Bender, just explain to me [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=199.76s)]
*  why Harvard is engaged or how layered it is for the law review person who viewed himself as, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=207.28s)]
*  I guess, wrongfully reprimanded based on the reporting. At what point in the timeline does [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  he become a West Wing staffer in the Trump war against Harvard? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=224.56s)]
*  Yeah, so he is, there is some overlap in those timelines. He, his first day in the White House [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=229.04s)]
*  was at the end of May at basically the same time the Department of Justice is sending Harvard [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  letters informing them that they have a cooperating witness from inside the law review. It's our [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  reporting that this employee, this former Harvard Law student started interviewing with the White [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=252.48s)]
*  House about roughly at the end of April. That's also about the same time this issue first bubbled [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=261.92s)]
*  up within the law review of potential discrimination against white men, white authors [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=270.08s)]
*  inside their review was from a conservative publication of the White House. And it's [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=275.92s)]
*  the Harvard Law Review was from a conservative publication, a story in the Washington Free Beacon [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=280.32s)]
*  that sort of spun up this story and launched investigations now from the Department of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=285.76s)]
*  Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Justice into [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=291.28s)]
*  the Harvard Law Review. Amanda Garbender, I don't know where to begin. We are now, I guess, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=297.92s)]
*  at the basic base to swallow the discrimination cases being pursued by the almighty United States [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=307.44s)]
*  Department of Justice Civil Division. The reporting suggests it may eventually become a criminal [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=314.56s)]
*  investigation by a young man who is now a West Wing staffer. Tell me all the things that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=318.8s)]
*  is wrong here. Yeah, I mean, it's worth taking a step back because it's hard to like keep track of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=326.8s)]
*  all the ways that Donald Trump is seeking to punish Harvard. And so like, what is this about? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=332.8s)]
*  I mean, this originally started with claims of the university not protecting Jewish students, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=338.72s)]
*  and that was a reason to question all these practices. And now it's just kind of spiraled [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=344.16s)]
*  out of control to the way that they want to police the editorial practices of a student-run paper. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=348.8s)]
*  I mean, this is, I mean, I think we should see this for what it is. This is an all-out attempt [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  for a hostile takeover of one of America's premier places of higher education, right? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=361.36s)]
*  Like these people want to use these threats and withholding federal funding essentially to make [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=368.8s)]
*  every college in America Hillsdale. They are questioning their ability to set their own [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=373.76s)]
*  hiring practices, admission, curriculum, and now what students write and say among themselves [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  for their own papers. I mean, this is an incredible, incredible overreach. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=387.52s)]
*  And, you know, I think they're so focused on Harvard precisely because it is a crown jewel [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=392.56s)]
*  of education. Essentially, if you can break Harvard, you can break all the colleges because [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  they have more resources. And so this is a roadmap. I don't think it's working, but it is working [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=400.79999999999995s)]
*  with some success, right, even at Harvard, because they have to engage in all these harassing [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=407.76s)]
*  investigations. The students now have to be afraid of what they're doing on their own. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=413.36s)]
*  And so this is going to be tough, but I do think everybody should be looking closely, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=418.64s)]
*  not just on the nitty-gritty and day by day of what they're doing to Harvard, but the big picture, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=424.0s)]
*  all the things they're doing. And, you know, I just got to praise Michael and everyone else [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=429.44s)]
*  who's really been following the story at the New York Times because it is hard to track. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=432.88s)]
*  It does take a lot of resources. I think they're up to something like eight separate [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=436.32s)]
*  investigations into Harvard right now. But if they can do it to Harvard, they'll do it to everyone else. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AELL0FLmjY&t=439.44s)]
