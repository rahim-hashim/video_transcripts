# ‘Retribution’: Capehart reacts to Cuomo being investigated by Trump’s DOJ
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0)
*  Ryan Reilly covering the Cuomo investigation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=0.0s)]
*  Jonathan Capehart is an MSNBC host, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=3.44s)]
*  Washington Post associate editor [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=5.72s)]
*  and Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=7.48s)]
*  and author of the new book, Yet Here I Am. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=9.4s)]
*  And an MSNBC legal correspondent is with us, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=12.44s)]
*  Lisa Rubin in studio. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=15.0s)]
*  Ryan, I wanna start out with this investigation [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=17.0s)]
*  into Andrew Cuomo. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=19.16s)]
*  What exactly is it about [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=20.62s)]
*  and why are we finding out about it now? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=21.92s)]
*  Yeah, it all has to do with this testimony [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=24.62s)]
*  that he gave about his response to COVID. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=26.94s)]
*  So Republicans had alleged that he had lied [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  during that testimony. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=32.28s)]
*  But the tricky part is here is that he refer, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=33.36s)]
*  he used that constant refrain [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=35.96s)]
*  that you constantly hear from politicians [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=37.64s)]
*  saying that they do not recall a certain event. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=39.32s)]
*  So it makes it a very tricky case to bring forward. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=41.86s)]
*  And it's not necessarily something [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=44.36s)]
*  that would be receiving a lot of attention, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  but Republicans had referred it [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  to the Justice Department previously, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=48.66s)]
*  and then sort of re-upped that referral just last month. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=50.2s)]
*  You can hear some of his testimony here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=54.08s)]
*  Trump's shocking allegations, all false, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=57.18s)]
*  were designed to shift blame from him to Democrats. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=61.18s)]
*  And they did. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=65.18s)]
*  They also created great pain, confusion, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=67.18s)]
*  and fear for families. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=70.18s)]
*  These are all diversions to blame New York [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=72.18s)]
*  and other states for the culpability [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=76.18s)]
*  of the federal response, which was malpractice. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=79.18s)]
*  So obviously with this investigation, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=84.18s)]
*  as well as the other one into the New Jersey, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=86.18s)]
*  Congresswoman, you have some pretty unique approach [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=88.18s)]
*  that the Justice Department is taking here, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=92.18s)]
*  a real departure from how these investigations [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=93.18s)]
*  have been handled previously. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=95.18s)]
*  And it all comes at a time when the public integrity section [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=96.18s)]
*  at DOJ has really been decimated and sort of sidetracked [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=99.18s)]
*  and put to the side as all of these investigations [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=102.18s)]
*  move forward, Chris. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=105.18s)]
*  So, Jonathan, even if the Trump administration argues [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=107.18s)]
*  there are legitimate reasons for this, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=110.18s)]
*  there are legitimate reasons to investigate [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=112.18s)]
*  New York's COVID response, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=114.18s)]
*  can you separate that from the reception, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=116.18s)]
*  that this is just another example of Trump using the DOJ [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=118.18s)]
*  to go after a political enemy? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=122.18s)]
*  No, you can't separate it, Chris. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=124.18s)]
*  I mean, in the intro to this segment, you pointed out, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=126.18s)]
*  not only is he reportedly going after the former governor [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=129.18s)]
*  and current candidate for mayor of New York City, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=134.18s)]
*  he is going after a member of the Justice Department, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=137.18s)]
*  is going after a member of Congress who is trying to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=140.18s)]
*  exercise her oversight duties as a member of Congress. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=143.18s)]
*  We also can't forget about Judge Dugan, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=147.18s)]
*  the judge in Milwaukee, who the Justice Department, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=150.18s)]
*  who has been arrested in an immigration-related case. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=154.18s)]
*  These are all things that you have to look at [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=159.18s)]
*  from the lens of what the president promised [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=162.18s)]
*  during his campaign, and that was retribution. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=165.18s)]
*  And that is what we're seeing here. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=168.18s)]
*  So, Lisa, back in 2021, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=170.18s)]
*  Janine Pirro was still a host on Fox News. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=172.18s)]
*  She's now the interim U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=175.18s)]
*  the office that's heading up this investigation. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=179.18s)]
*  So with that in mind, I want to play part of, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=182.18s)]
*  it's really a small part of a 10-minute diatribe [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=185.18s)]
*  she did back then about Cuomo's decision [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=188.18s)]
*  to allow infected seniors to go into nursing homes. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=191.18s)]
*  You are incompetent. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=196.18s)]
*  You, by undercounting and underreporting, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=198.18s)]
*  you not only tried to cover up your intentional effort [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=201.18s)]
*  that recklessly caused the death of thousands of seniors, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=205.18s)]
*  you believed you could manipulate the press [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=208.18s)]
*  and the public at the same time. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=210.18s)]
*  And when caught, you blamed everyone in the federal government, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=212.18s)]
*  President Trump, old age, Roger Stone, and God. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=215.18s)]
*  You cannot escape the consequences [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=219.18s)]
*  of your intentional and reckless acts. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=221.18s)]
*  Again, that went on for 10 minutes. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=224.18s)]
*  We should note that Cuomo has testified. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=226.18s)]
*  He was following federal guidelines at the time [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=228.18s)]
*  when he made the decision. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=230.18s)]
*  In that same segment, Janine Pirro suggested [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=232.18s)]
*  that an investigation could look into crimes, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=234.18s)]
*  including manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=236.18s)]
*  Where could this go? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=240.18s)]
*  I think given where the investigation is, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=243.18s)]
*  again, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of D.C., [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=246.18s)]
*  the jurisdiction that they would have [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=249.18s)]
*  would be over Andrew Cuomo's comments and testimony to Congress. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=251.18s)]
*  Some of the other things that allegedly occurred here [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=255.18s)]
*  occurred in New York, where Andrew Cuomo was governor at the time. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=258.18s)]
*  It's not clear to me that Janine Pirro, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=262.18s)]
*  as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of D.C., [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=264.18s)]
*  would have any jurisdiction to prosecute those things. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=266.18s)]
*  However, she may be looking into the veracity [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=269.18s)]
*  of Andrew Cuomo's testimony. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=272.18s)]
*  And as Ryan said earlier, those I don't recalls [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=274.18s)]
*  make prosecuting somebody for lying to Congress [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=278.18s)]
*  a lot more difficult. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=281.18s)]
*  Chris, there's one more thing that I want to note is... [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=283.18s)]
*  Because you can't get into their head [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=285.18s)]
*  and know whether or not they recall or not. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=287.18s)]
*  Correct. And unless you have counter-evidence [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=289.18s)]
*  showing that in fact they do recall, for example, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=291.18s)]
*  contemporaneous statements that they made privately, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=293.18s)]
*  hard to show that they in fact did recall. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=295.18s)]
*  Janine Pirro has herself been under investigation [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=298.18s)]
*  by the Department of Justice [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=302.18s)]
*  well before she was ever a host on Fox. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=304.18s)]
*  While she was running for political office, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=307.18s)]
*  she was running for attorney general against who? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=309.18s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=312.18s)]
*  So this is a history that is very long-standing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=314.18s)]
*  And it's not at all clear to me that in a normal, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=317.18s)]
*  conventional Department of Justice, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=320.18s)]
*  Janine Pirro would have any choice but to recuse herself [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=322.18s)]
*  from this investigation. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=324.18s)]
*  And just to be clear, she lost. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=326.18s)]
*  She did. She withdrew from it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=328.18s)]
*  Okay, Jonathan, all of this is coming against the backdrop [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=330.18s)]
*  of a political race, and you mentioned it [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=332.18s)]
*  for mayor of New York City. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=334.18s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo is leading among Democrats. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=336.18s)]
*  The primary is just a few days, more than a month away. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=338.18s)]
*  If he wins, he would go up against Mayor Eric Adams, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=341.18s)]
*  who was also under investigation until early April [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=344.18s)]
*  when a judge dismissed charges against him [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=348.18s)]
*  at the request of DOJ. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=351.18s)]
*  Is the Trump administration putting its thumb [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=354.18s)]
*  on the scales here? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=356.18s)]
*  You know, in the before times, I would say to you, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=358.18s)]
*  Chris, oh no, that would never happen. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=362.18s)]
*  The administration would never do such a thing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=365.18s)]
*  But we're talking about the Trump administration [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=368.18s)]
*  and specifically a second Trump administration [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=370.18s)]
*  that is way more brazen about exercising power, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=373.18s)]
*  whether it is legal or not, to do things that it wants to do, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=379.18s)]
*  to do things that the president wants to do. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=383.18s)]
*  And if the president thinks, and his administration thinks, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=386.18s)]
*  that going after Andrew Cuomo could possibly help [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=389.18s)]
*  Eric Adams, someone the president pardoned, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=393.18s)]
*  it seems like it, that they are willing to do it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=397.18s)]
*  The question remains whether that will work, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=402.18s)]
*  because in the end, the election of a mayor [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=405.18s)]
*  is in the hands of the people. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=408.18s)]
*  Yeah, and you never know, given New York's political leanings, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=410.18s)]
*  that it might work against him. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=413.18s)]
*  I'm talking about Eric Adams to think that he's getting [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=415.18s)]
*  the support of Donald Trump. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=419.18s)]
*  Having said that, Lisa, in both of these cases, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=420.18s)]
*  the Congresswoman MacIver as well, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=423.18s)]
*  it turns out that both of them learned about it [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=426.18s)]
*  kind of after the fact. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=430.18s)]
*  It was public or it was on Twitter. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=432.18s)]
*  Is that normal? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=434.18s)]
*  Well, let's separate between the two, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=436.18s)]
*  because I don't think they're similarly situated. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=438.18s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo is understood to be under investigation. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=440.18s)]
*  Monica MacIver, I'm sorry, LaMonica MacIver, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=443.18s)]
*  learned about charges against her from a press release [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=446.18s)]
*  from the interim U.S. attorney [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=448.18s)]
*  and did not receive the actual charging documents [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=450.18s)]
*  for another 12-plus hours. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=452.18s)]
*  I reported that yesterday. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=454.18s)]
*  Yeah, her lawyers had to go after him. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=456.18s)]
*  Correct. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=457.18s)]
*  People oftentimes find out that they are subjects of investigation [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=458.18s)]
*  through media leaks. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=462.18s)]
*  Those are unfortunate. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=463.18s)]
*  They are also atypical. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=464.18s)]
*  But what's really atypical is somebody who then becomes [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=465.18s)]
*  a criminal defendant learning about it through the media. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=468.18s)]
*  Typically, you see the Department of Justice [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=471.18s)]
*  announcing charges simultaneously with their being publicly unsealed [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=473.18s)]
*  or filed in court, not hours ahead of time, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=477.18s)]
*  and certainly not before a defendant or their lawyer [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=480.18s)]
*  has an opportunity to defend against the charges. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=483.18s)]
*  LaMonica MacIver and her legal team didn't know [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=486.18s)]
*  she was facing two felony counts of assault [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=488.18s)]
*  against a federal officer until the next morning [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=490.18s)]
*  after Alina Haba's statement. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=493.18s)]
*  That's what's really atypical here, Chris. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=495.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodWl7UJe-0&t=507.18s)]
