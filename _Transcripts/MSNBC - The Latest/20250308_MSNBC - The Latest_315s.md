# Trump ‘trying a new approach’ by negotiating directly with Hamas: Fmr. FBI special agent weighs in
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc)
*  And joining us now is former FBI special agent and MSNBC national security analyst Clint Watts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=0.0s)]
*  Good to see you Clint. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=5.8s)]
*  So Axios reports that Israel objected to the Trump administration's direct talks with Hamas, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=6.7s)]
*  noting Israel found out about it through other channels, not from U.S. officials. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=12.8s)]
*  The U.S. designates Hamas as a terrorist organization and historically does not negotiate with them or other terrorist organizations. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=17.1s)]
*  So what does the administration think it could gain from breaking that position? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=24.6s)]
*  Yeah, it was a wild turn for me looking back over 25 years post 9-11 Hamas being the terrorist group of the U.S. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=29.3s)]
*  doesn't negotiate with terrorist groups, but I would say just if we zoom out a little bit looking at both the scenarios with Russia threatening sanctions [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=36.8s)]
*  also with Hamas trying to negotiate independently. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=45.2s)]
*  What you're seeing is the Trump administration trying an alternative approach whether you like the positions or not. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=48.7s)]
*  They've coming in with a totally different prescription for how they want to negotiate with everyone going bilateral [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=55.5s)]
*  then multilateral with a lot of different entities and trying to push and pull on both sides. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=61.5s)]
*  Interesting approach. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=66.1s)]
*  The challenge of the Trump administration to the Biden administration was the Biden administration stuck with a stuck with a national [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=68.6s)]
*  security establishment that was very traditional over many many decades are trying a new approach now, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=75.2s)]
*  whether that will make any meaningful gains or not, I think it is to be to be seen, but I think it's a different approach that we're not used to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=80.5s)]
*  if I've been on air with you, whether it was Bush Obama, you know, 20 years ago, we wouldn't see an approach like this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=87.7s)]
*  It would be quite consistent actually with most of these countries. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=95.0s)]
*  So the administration pause sending military supplies and sharing intelligence with Ukraine this week. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=98.7s)]
*  How specifically does this hurt Ukraine's war efforts? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=103.9s)]
*  Let's focus more on the intelligence. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=107.0s)]
*  I mean, obviously, if they're not getting the military supplies they need we can figure out how that affects it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=108.9s)]
*  But intelligence wise what happens without the US help? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think in Ukraine becomes very limited to whatever is mostly what we would call tactical or operational intelligence on the battlefield [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  things that they know may be a little bit of regional intelligence, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  but on a grand scale not really understanding what Russia is doing or vis-à-vis the Allies and partners a lot of the intelligence [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=128.3s)]
*  that was coming to Ukraine likely comes from a mix of NATO, the EU and the US. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=135.3s)]
*  US being the dominant player in all that much more, you know, capable much more types of intelligence that would go to Ukraine. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=139.8s)]
*  So it would limit things like broad-based targeting understanding situations on the battlefield. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=148.0s)]
*  But some in a much more defensive posture and really relying only on the sensors that they have just looking forward [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  that would really handicap their ability to to really take on any sort of more aggressive action [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=159.0s)]
*  like we've seen over the last six months vis-à-vis Russia. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=164.4s)]
*  All of this seems to be a play to try and get Ukraine to the negotiation table. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=167.3s)]
*  Have the tariffs sort of claims by President Trump on the Russians. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=171.9s)]
*  Same thing on the Russian side trying to really force a peace agreement in a very rapid period of time. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, let's face it. Russia could become more aggressive as the winter weather wanes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=182.70000000000002s)]
*  I mean that would allow them to step things up. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=187.1s)]
*  Let me get to what NBC News and some others report and that is that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=190.0s)]
*  halted offensive cyber operations against Russia. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  How critical are these operations to our US national security Clinton? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=198.4s)]
*  If reports are true, could it be leveraged to get Russia to the negotiating table somehow? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=203.1s)]
*  It seems that is the strategy Alex is to remove some of the pressure against Russia [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=211.0s)]
*  and hopes that it would bring Russia the negotiation table. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=215.6s)]
*  This is a quest and a campaign promise of President Trump to first hundred days in the war Russia Ukraine. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=218.7s)]
*  Now just knowing Russia having worked on it for a very long time. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=225.6s)]
*  That is not likely how Russia will interpret it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=229.89999999999998s)]
*  Instead, they would see that as a concession and a concession in the lead up to peace negotiations. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  Two parts of the battlefield in Ukraine. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=237.6s)]
*  One is on the ground. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=239.6s)]
*  The physical kinetic war that we see every day. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=240.6s)]
*  Second part is in the air and online, which is a mix of missile attacks, air attacks and cyber attacks. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=243.2s)]
*  And if this is the signal to Russia, there's standard strategy for any negotiation is called maximum pressure. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=248.6s)]
*  If the West or the EU the United States gives any ground Russia's automatic response is to double down and try and gain more ground [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=255.0s)]
*  such that when they come to the negotiation table, they are operating at more strength instead of more weakness. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=262.7s)]
*  So what you'll see is more cyber attacks more offensive operations. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=268.7s)]
*  These are the missile attacks. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=272.1s)]
*  You've seen even on Zelensky's hometown in recent days. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=273.8s)]
*  They're going to double down and try and gain as much ground as they can. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=277.1s)]
*  So when they come to the negotiation table, if they give up something, they're actually moving up to what was maybe now a week or two ago [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=279.5s)]
*  versus what their present situation is, which they've made more gains. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=286.5s)]
*  Okay, Clint Watts always appreciate your sage insights on these things. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=290.0s)]
*  See you again soon. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=293.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=294.1s)]
*  You [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=307.0s)]
