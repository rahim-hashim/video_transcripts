# DeSantis is ‘misinforming people’: Doctor slams Florida for banning fluoride from public water
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic)
*  Dr. You first here. How concerning is it to you that we now have a second state removing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=0.0s)]
*  fluoride from its water supply? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=5.44s)]
*  Well, Alex, you know, I think this is indicating and signaling what's happening across the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=7.2s)]
*  country, which is a bent knee approach across some states to public health policies that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  frankly have no evidence or grounding in reality. And so, you know, we know that fluoride in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=18.92s)]
*  the water supply helps prevent cavities and that it is kept within very safe limits because [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=24.6s)]
*  it's constantly being monitored. And so we know that point seven milligrams per deciliter, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  for example, or per liter is the is the safe level. And there are not unsafe levels of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=35.68s)]
*  fluoride in the Floridian water supply. And that's what the purpose of the EPA and the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  U.S. Public Health Service is to monitor that. But as the EPA continues to get defunded, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=45.88s)]
*  will they be able to do that work moving forward? We'll see. But there is no issue here. This [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=50.64s)]
*  is complete smoke and mirrors. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=54.28s)]
*  Let me pick up on that with you, Doctor, because we have the Tallahassee Democrat reporting [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  that Governor Ron DeSantis called fluoride forced medication. He did so at the bill signing [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=60.0s)]
*  yesterday. I mean, how dangerous is a statement like that? You heard what Jesse said about [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=65.52s)]
*  how it really evens the playing field and gives everybody a chance, certainly kids on [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=69.92s)]
*  up and having healthy teeth. What do you recommend people do after July 1st? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=74.28s)]
*  Well, this I mean, this is complicated in the sense that this is really frustrating. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=79.88s)]
*  And what they're trying to do is they're cherry picking data and misinforming people. This [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=85.36s)]
*  is their playbook. Let's just take a random data point here that is not relevant, is not [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=89.92s)]
*  causing a problem and then scare people. This is this this policy in Florida. The second [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  state is a solution in search of a problem that does not exist. To be clear, Jesse's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=100.84s)]
*  exactly correct. Fluoride in the water supply is safe. It promotes it. De-risks the risk [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  of school absenteeism because dental problems and exactly that. For those that, for example, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=114.3s)]
*  can't afford access to a dentist because dental supply dentist is not great. Not everybody [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=120.97999999999999s)]
*  has regular access to that. This is an equalizer. We know that safe levels of fluoride exist [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=126.41999999999999s)]
*  throughout Florida. It's not an issue. It's never been an issue and it prevents tooth decay. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=131.54s)]
*  That's the whole point here, especially amongst kids. And so, again, this is a solution in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=137.18s)]
*  search of a problem that does not exist. And this comes a couple of days after HHS Secretary [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=142.54s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before Congress about vaccines. Let's take a listen to that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=149.54s)]
*  If you had a child today, would you vaccinate that child for measles? For measles? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=156.38s)]
*  Probably for measles. I know what I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=163.26s)]
*  I don't think people should be taking advice, medical advice from me. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=171.42s)]
*  I'm sorry. He's the head of HHS. So if not him, who? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=176.46s)]
*  That's a good question. You know, what's broadened out from just him, he surrounded himself [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=181.42s)]
*  with doctors who are doctors in name only. They aren't doctors like myself and my colleagues [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=186.22s)]
*  that actually care for patients. His surgeon general pick doesn't have an active medical [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=190.62s)]
*  license, never actually completed residency. Dr. Oz has spent most of his time now in the wellness [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=194.7s)]
*  space, far removed from clinical care. His head of NIH is not a clinician. Marty McCreary gave [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=199.82s)]
*  up clinical practice to Algo. I mean, there's a phenotype of a quote unquote doctor that is surrounding [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=205.74s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that is not credible. They are not credible or respected in the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=211.5s)]
*  clinical community. So of course he's going to make these comments and they're not going to push back. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=216.46s)]
*  You're speaking to the daughter of a thoracic surgeon and I'm proud to have been that. And I [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=221.18s)]
*  know how important the medical community is and the scientific knowledge and yeah. Okay. Sobering. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=225.98s)]
*  Thank you, Dr. Van Goop. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z8ofJjYic&t=231.42000000000002s)]
