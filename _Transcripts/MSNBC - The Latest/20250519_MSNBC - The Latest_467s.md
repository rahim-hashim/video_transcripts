# Oncologist reacts to Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4)
*  Dr. Kirtland DeVille, Jr. Associate Professor of Radiation Oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=0.0s)]
*  Medical Director of the Johns Hopkins Proton Therapy Center. Dr. Thank you so much for joining us. First, your, I guess, general [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=6.96s)]
*  assessments of the diagnosis and how it was detected. Do you have any immediate questions about the timing of this and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  the severity of this diagnosis? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=23.68s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, thanks for having me. And yeah, I do have a number of questions just to try to get a better understanding of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=26.36s)]
*  his diagnosis, the stage, how advanced it is. We received some information, noted that it's an aggressive cancer, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  a form of prostate cancer. I saw a report that indicated specifically Gleason 9 prostate cancer. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  We classify prostate cancer through the biopsy process and assign it a score, which is known as the Gleason score. And that scale [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=49.76s)]
*  goes from 6 to 10. And anything 8 to 10, we call high risk and has the most potential for metastasis or spread. And that defines [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=57.56s)]
*  both the curability and the treatment options and the overall management strategy and the survival. So those are a lot of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=66.16s)]
*  questions to get around to get a better understanding of his cancer. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=73.88s)]
*  His office has described it as hormone sensitive. Can you help us understand what that means? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=77.83999999999999s)]
*  Yes. So prostate cancer, when it's first diagnosed, frankly, all prostate cancer likely is going to be hormone sensitive. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  The good part, usually we're telling patients, is that prostate cancer responds to hormone manipulation, that is, it uses [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=94.24s)]
*  testosterone to progress and advance. And so if we give treatments that essentially remove testosterone from the body, it [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  immediately acts to halt the cancer and stop the progression and delay the spread. And so by default, by definition, prostate [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  cancer generally, when it's diagnosed, is going to be hormone sensitive. And those are generally the first treatments that are [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=117.44s)]
*  applied for an advanced or aggressive case, as is being noted as. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  Dr. DeVille, another oncologist that I heard from mentioned that he was surprised that given that the former president has [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=129.12s)]
*  regular access to health care and screenings, and of course is a former president, that it is only now that this was [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=136.96s)]
*  diagnosed after it had already metastasized to his bones. What do you make of that? Is it just that this kind of cancer is so [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=145.0s)]
*  aggressive that by the time he was screened again, it had already spread? How surprising is it, I guess? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=154.04s)]
*  It is a little bit surprising for someone who we expect to have very close health care and management. On the other hand, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=164.72s)]
*  there are some controversies within prostate cancer that make it perhaps not so surprising. Our screening guidelines [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=173.72s)]
*  generally advocate for screening somewhere from around age 50 or 55 to age 70. And depending on a few different screening [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=181.64s)]
*  bodies, either recommend not screening past age 70 for prostate cancer or if the man has a life expectancy less than 10 [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=191.28s)]
*  years. Having said that, those with risk factors, with elevations in the blood tests or family history, other things may [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  continue screening later beyond age 70. And so it is unclear whether the president was having something like a simple [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=206.60000000000002s)]
*  PSA blood test with or without a digital rectal exam to examine or assess your screen essentially for prostate cancer. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=215.96s)]
*  We also don't know, there are some men who are actually being monitored with very indolent or unaggressive prostate cancer. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  They've been diagnosed and they're following on what we call an active surveillance protocol or strategy. And in that case, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=231.32s)]
*  they may be followed for many years and then eventually the cancer begins to progress and then requires treatment. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=239.04s)]
*  So generally in either strategy, we want to be able to stay ahead of the cancer and diagnose it at an early stage and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=245.96s)]
*  avoid the scenario of when it is spread or metastasized and essentially becomes incurable. And that's where we still have [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=253.16s)]
*  our poorest outcomes with prostate cancer. If it's diagnosed very early, five and 10-year survival are very high for men. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=260.44s)]
*  But once it's metastasized, a five-year survival does drop significantly. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  Doctor, is there anything that you, we were speaking to a medical contributor at MSNBC earlier, Dr. Gupta, who said [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=272.8s)]
*  aggressive chemotherapy probably would not be the course of action going forward for somebody who is 82 years old. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=278.2s)]
*  I was wondering if there were things that you would rule out. We also heard that surgery might be difficult on somebody [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=284.12s)]
*  who is also 82 years old. So does that narrow his options when you take two of the probably more aggressive forms of treatment off the table? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=289.16s)]
*  Sure, but I would say just aggressive doesn't necessarily mean better. So in terms of treatments that the patient might receive, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=297.76000000000005s)]
*  again, prostate cancer responds to hormonal therapy very well. Usually, at least initially, hormonal therapy is not curative, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=305.44000000000005s)]
*  but it does treat prostate cancer and can prolong the delay in the spread. And so most men in this situation are going to start with hormonal therapy. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=313.04s)]
*  And they will start with kind of what we think about as first-line and second-line hormonal therapy. So they'll be given often two drugs up front. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=320.2s)]
*  And the evidence shows that that can prolong the survival. There is data that giving men chemotherapy up front as kind of the second-line agent [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=327.36s)]
*  does prolong their survival. However, the chemotherapy is more toxic and doesn't necessarily do better than that second-line hormonal therapy. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=336.52s)]
*  So doing the two lines of hormonal therapy has essentially become the standard for these men in this setting, unless there's other things going on, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=342.52s)]
*  like what we call visceral involvement, which includes the lung or the liver, other areas that usually are not involved up front. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=349.68s)]
*  So it would be a more unusual or less common scenario to be getting chemotherapy up front. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=356.84s)]
*  Regarding surgery, most men actually increasing with age, even when they're in an early stage of curative standpoint, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=362.0s)]
*  they may be less likely to undergo surgery and more often undergo radiation therapy, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=369.64s)]
*  given that both have comparable outcomes in that scenario and the risks in morbidity and complications associated with surgery may go up increasing with age, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=374.8s)]
*  which the patient may not have or would have different sort of risk profile undergoing radiation treatment. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=384.96s)]
*  And so surgery, yes, is highly unlikely for the patient to have surgery in this scenario at that age. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=391.12s)]
*  And with metastasis, on the other hand, there may still be indications or role for local therapy with radiation treatment. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  We don't know all of those details, so I wouldn't get ahead of myself, but that might be an option, depending on how it's ultimately staged. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=405.0s)]
*  And now we're getting a reaction as well from some of the leaders. We were talking about this earlier here at the table. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=412.16s)]
*  We now have a statement from Nancy Pelosi saying President Joe Biden is a great American patriot. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=417.32s)]
*  Paul and I joined the millions across the country and around the world praying for him to have strength and a swift recovery in the battle against cancer, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=420.48s)]
*  and we're also hearing from House Republicans, including the Speaker Mike Johnson, the Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Majority Whip Tom Emmer, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  all expressing the same empathy. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=435.68s)]
*  Mike Johnson, the Speaker, saying this is certainly sad news, and the Johnson family will be joining the countless offers who are praying for the former president in the wake of his diagnosis. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5PwO7ng-M4&t=457.48s)]
