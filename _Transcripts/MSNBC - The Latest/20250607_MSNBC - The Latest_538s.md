# Analyst: Trump ‘running out of leverage’ in escalating feud with Harvard University
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM)
*  President Donald Trump is once again trying to turn Harvard into his presidential punching [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=0.0s)]
*  bag. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  But the courts are punching back. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  This week, after Trump issued yet another order to block the university from enrolling [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=7.74s)]
*  international students, Harvard rushed to court, as they've been doing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=12.16s)]
*  And in just four hours, a federal judge ruled in the school's favor and issued a temporary [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=16.16s)]
*  restraining order saying the president's directive would cause, quote, immediate and irreparable [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=20.2s)]
*  injury. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  But despite the loss, the administration shows no signs of easing up on Harvard. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=26.62s)]
*  Education Secretary Linda McMahon admitted the university has taken steps to counter [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=32.34s)]
*  anti-Semitism on campus, but she gives the credit to Trump's policies. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=36.9s)]
*  I have seen progress at Columbia. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=43.66s)]
*  And you know why? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=45.82s)]
*  I think we're seeing progress because we are putting these measures in place and we're [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=46.82s)]
*  saying we're putting teeth behind what we're looking at. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=49.7s)]
*  I'm really happy to see what Harvard did. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=53.22s)]
*  But I wonder if maybe they didn't get a little spur from our action. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=56.300000000000004s)]
*  Joining us now, Maya Jasdodoff, Coolidge Professor of History at Harvard University and Ankush [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=62.5s)]
*  Kadori, former federal prosecutor and senior writer for a political magazine. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=67.9s)]
*  Professor, I want to start with you because you're the first person I think that we've [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=71.62s)]
*  had from Harvard actually here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=76.58s)]
*  So when you're on campus, as you're talking to professors, as you're talking to the administration [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=80.0s)]
*  there, how are you guys taking this and why do you think you are the tip of the spear [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=83.92s)]
*  for this administration? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=89.28s)]
*  Well I think we're the tip of the spear because we're historically the oldest university in [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=91.76s)]
*  the U.S., one of the richest and one of the most prestigious not just in the U.S. but [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=96.0s)]
*  in the world. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=100.36s)]
*  So from a culture war perspective, I think there's a lot of reasons why the president [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=101.36s)]
*  and his war against the elites wants to target Harvard. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=105.98s)]
*  We experience it on campus as an unprecedented singling out of an institution of higher education [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=110.36000000000001s)]
*  as one of the president's enemies. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  And we view it as, as you said, the tip of the spear in a war against all of higher education [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=120.12s)]
*  in this country, which is a very dangerous thing that I think all citizens should be [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=126.44000000000001s)]
*  worried about. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=130.56s)]
*  You know, Ankush, the president thinks that Harvard's just going to cave to all the pressure. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=131.56s)]
*  Listen to what he had to say on Thursday. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=139.16s)]
*  All we want to do is see their list. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=142.16s)]
*  There's no problem with that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=145.32s)]
*  This is anybody outside of our country, international students, because when we see some of the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=146.88s)]
*  people that we've been watching, we say, where do these people come from? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=152.92s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=156.11999999999998s)]
*  No, we want to have foreign students come. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=157.11999999999998s)]
*  We're very honored by it, but we want to see their list. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=159.32s)]
*  Harvard didn't want to give us the list. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=162.32s)]
*  They're going to be giving us the list now. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=163.32s)]
*  I think they're starting to behave, actually, if you want to know the truth. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=166.2s)]
*  And so, Ankush, I should have been a little more specific about what the president was [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  talking about. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=174.54s)]
*  This is on the issue of visas for foreign students to come to Harvard. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=175.54s)]
*  But it's one more front in the war that the president has declared on Harvard University. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=181.1s)]
*  What levers does the Trump administration still have at its disposal to keep going at [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=187.2s)]
*  Harvard? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=192.72s)]
*  Does Harvard have a legal leg to stand on going forward? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=193.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he's running out of levers, it seems, right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=197.56s)]
*  He's trying to now block the arrival of international students. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=201.12s)]
*  He's canceling contracts. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=204.96s)]
*  He's set in motion all these efforts to sort of harm the university on its most central [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=205.96s)]
*  sort of features. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=211.8s)]
*  And legally, they're doing a pretty good job so far. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=213.44s)]
*  These cases are still in their early stages. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=216.28s)]
*  The central claim that Harvard is alleging is the First Amendment violation, that the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=218.24s)]
*  administration is retaliating against them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=222.32s)]
*  And I think for the most part, you know, they should prevail on those types of claims. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=224.76s)]
*  Whether they will prevail, of course, is not entirely predictable. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=228.6s)]
*  I think, in particular, the areas where there are sort of immigration implications, including [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=231.92s)]
*  like this proposed visa restriction, you know, courts tend to give the president more deference [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=239.0s)]
*  around immigration. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=244.72s)]
*  We saw this during the first term at the Muslim ban, even though there were lots of questions [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=245.72s)]
*  about why that even came into existence. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  So, you know, it's hard to predict how this will all shake out. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=251.76s)]
*  But they're, you know, they're winning so far. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=254.6s)]
*  But it's early stages still. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=256.96s)]
*  Professor, one of the things that has happened is Harvard is standing up while other schools [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=258.56s)]
*  are, some folks call it, capitulating. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=265.08s)]
*  Some others say trying to navigate a complicated process. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=267.24s)]
*  Have you been surprised by other universities like Columbia that have tried to figure out [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=271.16s)]
*  a different way to do this and maybe aren't standing up, standing as tough as Harvard [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=276.58s)]
*  is? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=280.92s)]
*  I'm certainly disappointed. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  I recognize, though, the very real financial impacts that these moves have. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=284.24s)]
*  They have the potential to shut down research enterprises in life saving areas of medical [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  research and all kinds of things that are really the at the core of what universities [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=297.64s)]
*  are about. And so if you're faced with the choice of halting your activities, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=304.88s)]
*  possibly laying off thousands of people, basically becoming something that is unrecognizable [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=310.56s)]
*  from what you're set up to do and making some changes to your policies. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=316.56s)]
*  I certainly understand why people are making those choices, but I am very disappointed. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=321.36s)]
*  I mean, the analogy that comes to mind to me is that the government is holding a gun [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=326.4s)]
*  to institutions heads and they're saying, all right, you can, you know, I'm going to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=331.36s)]
*  shoot you, but if you don't want me to shoot you, then please hang yourself. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=337.16s)]
*  And this is this is an absurd situation that universities have been put into. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=341.6s)]
*  I'm glad that Harvard is standing up for for the principles at stake and frankly, for [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=346.88000000000005s)]
*  fundamental constitutional rights and for the other colleges, too. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  Right. Because, like you said, Harvard is the tip of the spear. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=355.76000000000005s)]
*  If the administration, if any administration is able to take on the oldest, the most [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=358.36s)]
*  prestigious, the richest school, then what chance do the others have? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. If Harvard didn't do it, nobody was going to do it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=367.48s)]
*  And it's very uncertain to me, as Zankish just pointed out, we don't know how this is [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=371.0s)]
*  going to play out. Harvard, on the other side of this, may look really different from [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  what it was at the beginning of this. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=382.48s)]
*  But, you know, if Harvard didn't do it, then we would be looking at, I think, a really [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=384.76000000000005s)]
*  big wipeout of universities and other institutions of civil society in what is clearly [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=389.20000000000005s)]
*  an authoritarian power grab by this administration. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=395.2s)]
*  You know, Ankhish, we for weeks now, months now, we have been talking about what the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  professor is talking about, the administration's power grab in various aspects and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=405.36s)]
*  going after institutions of higher learning, particularly Harvard, is part of the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=412.88s)]
*  authoritarian playbook. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  I guess where I'm going is he can do all these things, hammer away at Harvard [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=421.44s)]
*  Institute, yet another Muslim ban, and force people to take him to court. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=428.0s)]
*  But how certain, how concerned are you that when these cases all get to the Supreme [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=434.44s)]
*  Court, that the administration will probably win most of them? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=441.52s)]
*  You know, I don't know how much of it they'll win. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=448.08000000000004s)]
*  They'll probably win some, unclear how much. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  It is a, you know, it's been a prominent trend of this administration and it's been a [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=453.68s)]
*  problematic one. I would say, though, that, you know, I think it's important to [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=458.16s)]
*  distinguish, you know, when we're talking about Trump's sort of revenge campaign or [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=461.88s)]
*  the use of the office for retaliatory purposes, you know, there are all sorts of [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=465.36s)]
*  things that have come under that umbrella, including his attacks on law firms, including [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=468.6s)]
*  his reprisals against certain individuals like Chris Krebs. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=472.68s)]
*  I think the universities are categorically distinct for a very important reason, which [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=475.68s)]
*  the professor touched on, which is that the effects of the administration's actions [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=479.6s)]
*  toward them don't just affect the university in the way that it would be local. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=485.64s)]
*  You know, the effects are localized on a law firm, affect the whole country and the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=488.88s)]
*  whole world because of how much research and other activities they do that most of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=492.32s)]
*  us don't have to worry about or even think about. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=496.72s)]
*  But they are the primary engines of innovation in a lot of areas in this country. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=498.6s)]
*  And so we actually all have a stake in this. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spdeZRBqYM&t=504.32s)]
