# Musk has ‘false impression’ he ‘created’ Trump’s presidency with campaign support: Cohen
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs)
*  And joining me now here in the studio is Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=0.0s)]
*  our principal of CrisisX and substack host at The Real Michael Cohen. He's also, of course, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=4.08s)]
*  the author of the bestselling book, Revenge, How Donald Trump Weaponized the U.S. Department [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  of Justice Against His Critics. Welcome, my friend. Here's my first question to you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=13.76s)]
*  Do you believe Donald Trump when he says, I'm not thinking about Musk? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=18.56s)]
*  No. He is thinking about him, but not in a positive way. He's really angry because Elon [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=22.16s)]
*  Musk did the ultimate thing, which is to act out against the best interests of Donald Trump. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=31.04s)]
*  It's disloyal in Donald's mind. And that, to Donald, is the worst defense that you could [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=38.32s)]
*  possibly do. And I think it was just a week ago today that you were on, and you predicted right [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=44.72s)]
*  after Musk was leaving the White House officially, ending his government service, if not months ago, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=50.4s)]
*  when these two first started a bromance, you said, yeah, this is going to happen. There's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=56.48s)]
*  going to be a big fallout. That bromance never had a chance of lasting. First of all, they're like [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=60.0s)]
*  two amped up hyenas, dragging the carcass of some animal right out of the dirt. But neither of them [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=64.96s)]
*  wants to share the kill. That's the whole problem. You have one guy who's the most powerful man in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=73.6s)]
*  the world, the other who is the richest man in the world, the guy with the power, of course, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=78.64s)]
*  elected president. But Elon Musk has this false impression that he created the president, therefore [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=85.28s)]
*  he's entitled to something. It is really when your reporter was saying that it's a clash of massive [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=93.84s)]
*  egos, it most certainly is. And neither of them are going to back down. I mean, to watch Elon Musk [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=102.4s)]
*  say the things that he said was absolutely incredible. I can't imagine what was going [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=108.0s)]
*  through his mind at that time, but I can't also imagine what was going through Trump's mind as he [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=114.96s)]
*  responded, especially responding to somebody considering they both own their own social media [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=120.64s)]
*  platforms, Truth Social versus X. On Truth Social, the Elon Musk post, it garnered 179 million views, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=126.0s)]
*  179 million Trumps, 172,000. I mean, there is a big difference in the size of the platform. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=137.2s)]
*  So the Republican Party, the GOP, they're concerned that Elon has gone off the rail [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=146.24s)]
*  and that he's going to ultimately affect the 2026 midterm elections. Can I just ask you, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=153.28s)]
*  given your experience with Donald Trump certainly in the past, when you look at Elon and he says, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=160.16s)]
*  I got this guy elected, and while there's reason to believe that that's not necessarily true, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=165.12s)]
*  he did devote over a quarter billion dollars into this campaign. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  And don't forget his platform X, which is worth as much as the 250 million that he put in. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  But did he do that? Have people done that in the past with Donald Trump with some sort of expectation? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=181.68s)]
*  Look, I'm going to support you. I'm expecting some kind of support in return. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=189.36s)]
*  Well, take a look at the entire cabinet. I mean, each and every one of the cabinet members, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  well, I should say each and every one, the vast majority of the cabinet members were all [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  significant donors to the Trump campaign. That's how they ended up in the inner circle. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  There's always a quid pro quo with Trump, and that's something that everybody knows. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  But it goes one way, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=214.24s)]
*  Only. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  Only one way. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  Loyalty, with Donald Trump, as I always refer, is like First Avenue here in Manhattan, one way. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=217.12s)]
*  NBC's Kristen Welker reports that Trump allies are going after Musk, with Steve Bannon saying [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=224.32s)]
*  Trump should pull every contract, start major investigations immediately. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=229.52s)]
*  Bannon also added, quote, thus spake the ketamine. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=233.12s)]
*  I mean, it's a sign that Trump's allies are zeroing in on Musk's alleged drug use. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=236.4s)]
*  Trump has said, by the Musk has said, he took ketamine to treat depression. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=241.12s)]
*  Bannon represents the MAGA base. So is revenge ultimately what they want? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, remember with Trump, it's always about distancing yourself first, disparaging, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=250.48s)]
*  which is what his acolytes, his enablers are doing, and then dengrading them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=256.56s)]
*  And that's what he's doing. Don't think for a second that Steve Bannon is out there on his own [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  saying these things. All of this is coordinated through the president. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=266.08s)]
*  Not a person is going out there and acting on behalf of the president without at least [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  his explicit knowledge and acceptance. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=275.12s)]
*  Like a phone call? Like the two of them chat and say, hey, listen, I need you to do this? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=278.48s)]
*  Sure. He calls up and he says, look, we're going to go against him. We have to go ahead and attack. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=282.48s)]
*  We all know that based upon even Elon's own words that he's a user of ketamine and other [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=287.44s)]
*  narcotics, let's discredit him. Let's turn around and attack him to try to make sure [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=295.2s)]
*  that whatever it is that he says, well, that's just the rantings of a drug addict. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=300.96s)]
*  That's the whole point. They all meet, they all get together, and they all parrot one another. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  As I always say, with Stalin, the more you repeat the lie, the more the lie becomes the truth. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=313.76s)]
*  Well, what happens when it's actually factually accurate? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=318.88s)]
*  I spoke with Miles Taylor just a short time ago, years after working with [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=322.88s)]
*  Donald Trump during his first term. He has said that his life has been deeply, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=327.12s)]
*  deeply affected by the actions that Donald Trump is taking against him in his second term. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=331.44s)]
*  Do you see Trump letting go of this with Elon Musk? Could it simmer for a while and then he [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=336.08s)]
*  takes action? How do you see this playing out? No. Elon went way too low in those posts, especially [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  the ones in regard to Jeffrey Epstein. And I was on an earlier MSNBC program where I absolutely [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=351.52s)]
*  refute having any knowledge whatsoever. And again, I was as close to Trump for a decade and a half [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=358.08s)]
*  in regard to the Epstein. That doesn't make me a supporter taking the knee for Trump. What it does [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=363.84s)]
*  is it's expressing the truth. Let's concentrate on the things right now that matter. Now, I have [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=371.35999999999996s)]
*  Miles Taylor coming on my podcast on Monday. Great interview. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  And I spoke to him. Yeah, I spoke to him about the exact same things. He's been doxed. I've been [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=380.0s)]
*  doxed. He was swatted. I've been swatted. They swatted my parents in Florida. I mean, this is [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  who the MAGA base is. And it's sad because this isn't the way American politics is supposed to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=392.32s)]
*  run. That you should be fearful to speak truth to power. There are elected officials. They're not [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=399.28s)]
*  our kings. Let me ask about something which I know is important to you because you are one of several [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=405.2s)]
*  co-authors, Michael, and it is on an op-ed in The Hill. And you've criticized President Biden's [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=411.44s)]
*  rejection of their pardons. You've been asking for reconsideration, calling for the system to be [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=416.4s)]
*  reformed. Are you taking sides with Trump against Biden because you were unsuccessful in securing [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  a pardon from Biden? I mean, give me sort of the big picture of what you're going after here. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=431.52s)]
*  So the picture here is, and I think a lot of people who reported on it got it all wrong. If [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=436.08s)]
*  they really read the op-ed, what they need to understand is Jesse Jackson, myself, and several [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=441.68s)]
*  others authored this. And what we're saying is we worked very hard on these applications. It's not [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=446.48s)]
*  something you put together in a day or a weekend. Spent four or five months. I, for example, I have [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=453.6s)]
*  seven letters from historical figures, two of the top constitutional lawyers in America, two members [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  of Congress, two historical legal figures as well in the Nixon era, as well as an ethics czar who [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=466.0s)]
*  worked for three administrations. I wanted the right and the fair consideration for the application [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=476.4s)]
*  not to just turn around and have it ignored because it's not necessarily Biden. It's the people [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=484.32s)]
*  that were around him. So yes, I don't believe that they showed these documents, mine, Jesse, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=489.91999999999996s)]
*  who had 40 letters. I don't believe that this was really considered properly, which is to the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=496.56s)]
*  president who has that special power conferred to him in the constitution. It's basically the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  hand of God. But where people are getting this wrong about me, this isn't necessarily about me. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=508.96s)]
*  There's 70 million Americans who are right now affected by having the scarlet letter of felon [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=514.8s)]
*  next to the name. My sentence was 36 months. I'm already out for over five years. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  Did you time? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=526.9599999999999s)]
*  I did my time. I have no restitution. Why do I have to carry the sentence that the judge imposed? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  Wasn't the lifetime sentence. And I believe that if Trump understands the policy that Jesse, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=534.56s)]
*  myself and others are trying to put forth, first of all, it affects 70 million Americans. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=540.64s)]
*  I think he takes the Nobel Peace Prize for changing 70 million people. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=545.92s)]
*  Trump would get that, you think? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=550.2399999999999s)]
*  Yes, I believe he would. But more importantly, you know who else it affects? It affects him. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=551.5999999999999s)]
*  He's a felon as well. He didn't do his time. He was commuted his sentence by the court, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=556.4799999999999s)]
*  but he still carries the felony conviction name. He carries the same scarlet letter that Jesse [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=563.68s)]
*  Jackson Jr. and I do. By doing so, he would actually remove that scarlet letter from himself [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=569.92s)]
*  as well. So you don't have to be a felon for the rest of your life. And I believe that somebody [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=576.16s)]
*  like Trump, who is, let's say, not as under control by a group of individuals as [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=582.7199999999999s)]
*  the Biden administration was running, I think he's somebody who would potentially look at [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=592.64s)]
*  this type of policy. And again, it affects 70 million Americans. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=597.52s)]
*  Yeah. We'll see. Let us know what comes of this. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=601.28s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=604.0799999999999s)]
*  Yep. Who knows? We will see, my friend. Thank you, Michael Cohen. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC3aeCYirXs&t=604.48s)]
