# Biden to deliver first post-presidency speech on preserving social security benefits
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q)
*  Today, Joe Biden will be back in the national spotlight, making his first public speech [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  since leaving office. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=4.46s)]
*  In Chicago, he'll deliver remarks focused on protecting Social Security, taking up the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=6.16s)]
*  Democratic argument that President Trump and Elon Musk are intent on gutting the agency. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=11.06s)]
*  I want to bring in Juanita Tolliver, an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  Joining me here in studio, Joel Payne, Democratic strategist and former senior aide for Hillary [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=20.22s)]
*  Clinton's 2016 campaign. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  I mean, Joel, like most previous presidents, Joe Biden's been laying low. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=26.6s)]
*  Let the new president have his time. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=30.48s)]
*  Even as, I should say, Donald Trump has blamed Joe Biden for just about everything that he [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=32.88s)]
*  thinks is wrong in the world. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=38.16s)]
*  So why this speech and why now? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=40.04s)]
*  Well, look, I think at some point, President Biden is going to find a way to, you know, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=42.6s)]
*  tell his own story, to maybe start to roll back some of the narratives that he left [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  office with. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=51.74s)]
*  And I imagine this is as good as form of any. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=52.74s)]
*  Look, I think it is realistic to say the Democrats still, many of them have a significant sense [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=55.58s)]
*  of betrayal, not necessarily just from President Biden, but maybe from the folks around him, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=60.62s)]
*  not creating the type of urgency around exiting the race and not creating the type of urgency [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=65.98s)]
*  around the last election. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=71.62s)]
*  And I think that's a real sense of betrayal that I'm hearing from the folks I talked to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=72.9s)]
*  and that you hear from voters. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=76.58s)]
*  So are you saying there's a lot of people in the Democratic Party who wish he would [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=77.9s)]
*  just stay laying low? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=81.7s)]
*  I don't know if it's that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=83.18s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  Look, I'm sure it's a relatively easy ticket to get, you know, if you want to. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  But I think it's more that Democrats would like for there to be some accounting for why [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=89.64s)]
*  the urgency that Democrats have talked about the moment that we're in right now, why that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  didn't get met with action by President Biden and by some of the folks around him. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=99.56s)]
*  Well, you know, Juanita, we have seen some other Democrats amping it up. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  Cory Booker, of course, with that 25 hour long speech. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders has this fighting oligarchy tour. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  In fact, last night, he drew more than 12000 people in Ruby Red, Idaho. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=112.92s)]
*  But but is there, do you think, a desire to see more of Joe Biden or any of Joe Biden [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=119.34s)]
*  since we haven't seen him? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=125.26s)]
*  I don't think so, Chris. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=127.7s)]
*  And I think Joel was being very diplomatic in his response because the feeling is get [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=129.1s)]
*  somebody else to do it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=134.46s)]
*  Why Joe Biden? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=135.86s)]
*  Why now? Get somebody else up there. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=137.34s)]
*  And it also begs the question of who Democrats are looking for as their future de facto [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=139.52s)]
*  leader, because I assure you, many of many people within the Democratic Party are probably [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=144.04s)]
*  not looking to Joe Biden to fill that role either. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=149.24s)]
*  I know in a press call earlier today, Hakeem Jeffries said that this issue around [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=152.0s)]
*  Social Security administration and benefits for 73 plus million people is an all hands [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=157.12s)]
*  on deck effort. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=162.4s)]
*  But again, many in the public, many in the party are likely saying get someone else out [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=163.76s)]
*  front that shows that Democrats are looking to identify someone else to be the voice of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=168.88s)]
*  their party because the message is critical, Chris. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=173.38s)]
*  And it's important that it gets stated how important Social Security benefits are, how [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=175.66s)]
*  many people would be impacted. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=179.92s)]
*  The fact that 85 percent of the population is against the proposals and cuts made by [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  the Trump administration, including 80 percent of Republicans, it's just about getting a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=185.96s)]
*  better messenger to convey that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, Joe Biden's event today will be focused on the rallying bipartisan support, right, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=193.14s)]
*  because he's also got former Republican Senator Roy Blunt, for example, is going to be [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=198.28s)]
*  there. What does it tell us, though, about the potency of this issue for voters that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=202.8s)]
*  Joe Biden and his team and whatever you think about him now, his supporters will say he [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=211.28s)]
*  is the one guy who beat Donald Trump, right, have focused on this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=217.24s)]
*  Like where in the pantheon of things that Democrats should be focused on is Social [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=222.04s)]
*  Security. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=226.88s)]
*  I think political gravity still applies very much to the issue of Social Security. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=227.52s)]
*  I have people in my life who have already recently reported to me they have seen delay in [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=231.08s)]
*  benefits that they normally expect to receive. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=235.84s)]
*  And I imagine that that has multiplied thousandfold across the country by people who have [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=238.8s)]
*  come to rely upon this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=243.36s)]
*  So it's a very salient issue. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=244.84s)]
*  One broader point I want to make, and I think Juanita is probably right, I'm probably being [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  maybe a little bit too kind to President Biden in absentia. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=249.72s)]
*  But I would say this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=253.4s)]
*  This is a moment where I do think not just Democrats, but the broader public would like to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=254.8s)]
*  hear from grass tops folks, whether it's President Biden in this form, President Obama [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=259.04s)]
*  related to the issue with Harvard University. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=263.92s)]
*  I know that's not our topic here, but there is space for these national Democratic [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=266.0s)]
*  leaders to weigh in, to not create permission for the things that we are seeing right now [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=271.12s)]
*  to continue to happen. And I do think that is a role for an ex-president that is very [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=276.52000000000004s)]
*  much appropriate. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=280.92s)]
*  Also happening today, Juanita, is a Social Security Day of Action. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries is spearheading this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=286.0s)]
*  He suggests Republicans ultimate goal may be to privatize Social Security. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  Let me play that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=294.44s)]
*  Republicans are demonizing Social Security by calling it a Ponzi scheme. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=297.96000000000004s)]
*  They are downsizing the ability of the Social Security administration to provide earned [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=305.04s)]
*  benefits to New Yorkers and the American people, which leads to the ultimate conclusion [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=310.6s)]
*  that they may be trying to privatize it because that has been on their agenda in the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=318.88s)]
*  past. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, to be honest, George W. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  Bush learned the hard way how dangerous it is to attempt to privatize Social Security. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=329.0s)]
*  Is it possible that with buyouts and early retirements and the hobbling of staff, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=334.04s)]
*  problems for the agency's websites, phone systems, that we have already seen the worst of it? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=339.64s)]
*  I won't say we've seen the worst of it because, Chris, we haven't even hit the 100 day mark yet [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=346.36s)]
*  of this administration. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  And so they are clearly sticking to their path. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  What I will say, though, the one thing that could stop them in this push as Hakeem Jeffries is [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=355.84s)]
*  predicting towards privatization is continued public engagement and public outcry. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=361.56s)]
*  Chris, I say that pointing to the Trump administration's specific intention of trying to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=367.16s)]
*  force people into in-person visits to Social Security offices in order to access their [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=373.04s)]
*  benefits as well as to file claims. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  Now, we saw just six days ago that that action was rolled back because of public outcry, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=381.04s)]
*  because the people spoke up. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=387.0s)]
*  And that, I think, is the intention behind this day of action, is reminding people of their [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=389.08000000000004s)]
*  power to resist and reject some of the harmful policies coming out of this administration. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, as Hakeem Jeffries pointed out, the evidence is there as far as their actions, whether [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=398.56s)]
*  that's the mass layoffs, these harmful proposals. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=403.56s)]
*  And now they're using this anti-fraud system to flag people and block benefits [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=406.88s)]
*  potentially. And so, yeah, we should all be very alarmed about their intentions to try to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=412.36s)]
*  privatize the Social Security administration. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=417.2s)]
*  But still, the power lies with the people and speaking up and calling out this [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=419.48s)]
*  administration and refusing to accept any of the changes they're proposing. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=424.52s)]
*  Juanita Tolliver, Joel Payne, thank you both so much. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVI2F0DUt2Q&t=429.12s)]
