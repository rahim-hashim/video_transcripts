# Gov. Newsom says federal government is moving to 'take over' the California National Guard
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE)
*  We're back with breaking news in LA. California Governor Gavin Newsom just was out with his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=0.0s)]
*  first reaction to today's chaos, clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Joining us [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=6.04s)]
*  now from LA is Jacob Soboroff, NBC News political and national correspondent who's been reporting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  on the protests in Los Angeles. Jacob, can you break down what was Governor Newsom's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=17.56s)]
*  message right now? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=23.0s)]
*  Yeah, Elise, you know, just to back up for a second, this is somewhat of a watershed moment here in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=25.6s)]
*  California and across the country because, as you know, there are more undocumented people that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=30.44s)]
*  live in Los Angeles County than any other county in the United States of America. President Trump [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=35.04s)]
*  has long promised, since I reported from the floor of the conventions, a mass deportation effort [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=40.72s)]
*  bigger than the size and scale of the historic 1954 one run by Dwight D. Eisenhower that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  deported a million Mexicans and some Mexican Americans after the Bracero program in the 1950s. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=51.0s)]
*  And that is essentially the feeling on the ground here in Los Angeles over the course of the last [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=57.04s)]
*  two days. And with Tom Homan, the borders are for President Trump out here in Los Angeles and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=63.24s)]
*  saying that the National Guard would be deployed tonight, it has raised a lot of questions about [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=69.4s)]
*  the federal government's ability to do that, of course, to effectuate that because the National [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=74.0s)]
*  Guard is under the control of the governor of the state of California. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=78.4s)]
*  But the federal government evidently is insisting that under Title 10 of the United States Code, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=81.76s)]
*  they are able to deputize these National Guard troops as on a federal military mission on the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=86.76s)]
*  streets of Los Angeles tonight. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=92.92s)]
*  Here's the statement from Governor Newsom, which we just received from his office. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=94.2s)]
*  He says the federal government is moving to take over the California National Guard, to take [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=97.48s)]
*  over the California National Guard and deploy two thousand soldiers. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=102.84s)]
*  That move is only purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=107.2s)]
*  The governor goes on to say, L.A. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=111.64s)]
*  authorities are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment's notice. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=113.28s)]
*  We are in close coordination with the city and the county that and there is currently no unmet [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=117.72s)]
*  need. The Guard has been admirably serving L.A. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=123.0s)]
*  throughout recovery, of course, referring to the wildfires that happened exactly six months ago [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=125.84s)]
*  today here in Los Angeles. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=130.68s)]
*  This is the wrong mission and will erode public trust. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=132.32s)]
*  And just to reiterate, I had spoken to the governor's office just moments before coming on the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=136.0s)]
*  air. They have been in touch with the White House over the course of the last several days [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=139.36s)]
*  coordinating, the governor's office says, on the response to these protests and obviously to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=144.0s)]
*  coordinate on these federal immigration enforcement actions. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=149.28s)]
*  I'm not saying to cooperate with them, but to have an understanding of what is happening on on the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=152.36s)]
*  ground here. The federal government says one hundred and eighteen people so far have been detained [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=156.72s)]
*  as of earlier today. Obviously, these actions was all been watching with these actions. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=161.88s)]
*  The numbers may go up. But the bottom line is, I'd like to underscore the governor of California is [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=166.96s)]
*  saying that the president of the United States is trying against his wishes to deploy his [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=171.96s)]
*  National Guard, the California National Guard, on a federal military mission on the streets of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=176.52s)]
*  Los Angeles County tonight and Southern California in order to respond and participate in this [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=182.68s)]
*  large scale immigration enforcement effort that is taking place throughout streets here in the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=188.28s)]
*  Los Angeles area. And you're watching some of that on the left hand side of your screen right now. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=194.32000000000002s)]
*  So, Jacob, to kind of drill down on that divide that is happening right now, it seems that you're [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  going to have to certainly based on the statements that have been made by both federal officials, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=203.72s)]
*  including Tom Homan, who is calling for the deployment of the National Guard in L.A., as well as [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=208.52s)]
*  the statement that you just laid out for us with California Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=213.04s)]
*  How does this play out? Is there going to be a legal challenge as to whether or not the federal [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=218.4s)]
*  government can step in and make the claim that it is simply using the National Guard to enforce [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=222.72s)]
*  federal law? Because what's at stake here is the dispute as to whether or not, as Governor Newsom [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=228.68s)]
*  has laid out, the authorities, the local authorities have the ability to continue to maintain law and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=233.76s)]
*  order and security and safety for the residents of the Los Angeles area. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=239.72s)]
*  What the governor's office is telling me, Eamon, is that it's pretty clear in the Constitution the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=246.52s)]
*  president has the authority to do this, whether the governor likes it or not. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=251.4s)]
*  And you'll remember that at the very beginning of the administration, right on January 20th, one of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=255.44s)]
*  the first executive orders, Executive Order 14167 on January 20th, was clarifying the military's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=260.08s)]
*  role in protecting the territorial integrity of the United States. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=266.12s)]
*  And in that early executive order and subsequent directives from the White House, including a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=270.08s)]
*  mission, military mission for sealing the southern border of the United States, a memoranda of April [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=276.92s)]
*  11th, 2025, the White House made clear that they were considering and had at their disposal the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=281.92s)]
*  option to use this Title 10 of the United States Military Code to deploy National Guard on a [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=287.4s)]
*  federal military mission into the interior of the United States, whether or not other groups or the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=293.2s)]
*  state of California ends up bringing this into court. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  Obviously, as an open question, it's a good one posed by you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=302.92s)]
*  We don't know the answer to that tonight. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=305.88s)]
*  But of course, there are people out on the streets of Los Angeles and elsewhere watching from around [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=308.36s)]
*  the country, including some of your guests this evening, the question whether or not, as I've been [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=312.08s)]
*  saying, the size and the scale of this operation are commensurate with bringing in 44 people at [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  worksite enforcement raids yesterday, going out to Home Depots throughout Los Angeles and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=321.68s)]
*  reportedly going after day laborers standing on the side of the street looking to get work. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=329.96s)]
*  You know, the question is here, who are these people that the federal government that ICE, that HSI, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=335.0s)]
*  Homeland Security Investigations is going after in Los Angeles this weekend? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=339.8s)]
*  If the answer is people with a long list of criminal records and rap sheets with severe crimes, it'd be [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=345.12s)]
*  consistent with the early messaging of this administration. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=351.0s)]
*  If ultimately these are collateral arrests that are picking up workers, fathers, mothers, sons and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=353.56s)]
*  daughters, people going to school, people going to work, it's a different conversation. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=360.12s)]
*  And whether or not that fits squarely into what the president has said, Stephen Miller has said, Tom [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=364.68s)]
*  Holman has said, is a mission to secure the territorial integrity of the United States or if it's [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=368.72s)]
*  to go after lower level people who are here just without papers in essence, but have committed no other [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  crimes. So but the headline is tonight, the federal government is trying to deploy the National Guard here to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=381.92s)]
*  the streets of Los Angeles. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=387.0s)]
*  The governor of California is standing up in opposition to that, but it's pretty clear that he's not so sure [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=388.16s)]
*  there's so much that he can do. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=393.88s)]
*  Amen. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=395.24s)]
*  Donald Trump actually recently posted on social media a statement about all of this saying, quote, if [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=396.76s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newscum of California and Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles can't do their jobs, which everyone [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=403.04s)]
*  knows they can't, then the federal government will step in and solve the problem. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=409.8s)]
*  Riots and looters the way it should be solved. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=414.24s)]
*  Multiple exclamation points. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=417.92s)]
*  So, Jacob, I want to ask you a little bit about what who is actually keeping order on the ground because we [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=419.96000000000004s)]
*  had our colleague Steve Patterson on earlier. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=426.0s)]
*  He was wearing a gas mask dealing with with gas canisters being fired at him. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=428.68s)]
*  And he said he could not tell who was actually firing that upon the crowds. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=434.2s)]
*  Was it the feds? Was it ice? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=440.88s)]
*  Was it the FBI? Was it local riot police? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=442.79999999999995s)]
*  Do we actually have information about what law enforcement cohorts are there right now? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=444.88s)]
*  What we've seen, Catherine, over the course of the past several days is sort of a potpourri of federal [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=453.6s)]
*  government officials, law enforcement officials, Homeland Security investigations, which [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=459.20000000000005s)]
*  traditionally goes after human trafficking and money laundering and other types of transnational [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=464.04s)]
*  criminal activity. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=469.32000000000005s)]
*  But they have been essentially deputized to go after undocumented immigrants on the street here. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=470.32000000000005s)]
*  The FBI issued a statement yesterday saying that they were supporting these efforts as well. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=474.88s)]
*  And then, of course, your traditional ICE agents. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=480.92s)]
*  What I'm looking at on the screen right now, those black and whites in Paramount, California, I believe [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=482.52s)]
*  those would be Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies because that's not within the city limits of the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=487.12s)]
*  city of Los Angeles. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=492.44s)]
*  The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is responsible for the larger Los Angeles County area. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=494.4s)]
*  But they, as well as the LAPD, are insistent that they are not participating in federal immigration [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=499.88s)]
*  enforcement efforts only in the law enforcement support for the aftermath of those raids. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXF1icO9iE&t=504.96s)]
