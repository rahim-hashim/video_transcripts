# Trump's goofy statements suggest explanation for lack of published transcripts
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI)
*  President Trump is truly the most transparent and accessible president in American history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=0.0s)]
*  And President Trump is the most transparent president ever. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=5.88s)]
*  This has been the most transparent administration in history, probably in world history. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=8.56s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what the difference between history and world history, what even the context [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=14.08s)]
*  of world history is supposed to be there, but you get the idea. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=19.96s)]
*  Trump officials love, they love, they love to talk about how Trump is the most transparent [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=23.64s)]
*  president in history. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=27.86s)]
*  I don't have to tell you that claim is bizarre a little bit. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=29.259999999999998s)]
*  It's also kind of hilarious, given how wrong it is. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=31.939999999999998s)]
*  Now, here's the headline today from the HuffPost. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=34.38s)]
*  Most transparent White House in history keeps majority of Trump's remarks secret. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=37.379999999999995s)]
*  HuffPost reports that since Trump took office, the White House has published just 29 transcripts [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=42.94s)]
*  of the 146 public remarks Trump made in his first 100 days. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=48.1s)]
*  Now, for all of you math nerds out there, that's less than 20 percent of the remarks [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=52.54s)]
*  he's made have been published. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=57.58s)]
*  The White House hasn't actually published a Trump transcript in over two months. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=59.54s)]
*  So why is the most transparent administration in history trying to hide what the most transparent [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=64.38s)]
*  president in history apparently, or the world, says from the public? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=69.26s)]
*  Why are they trying to hide it? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=73.46s)]
*  Well, maybe it's because he keeps saying things like this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=74.94s)]
*  The drone is killing tremendous numbers of people. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=78.06s)]
*  You hide behind a tree and the drone comes down and it circles you with fire. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=82.82s)]
*  You don't have a chance. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=87.18s)]
*  The tree comes down also, by the way. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=88.18s)]
*  It's so intense. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you see these trees being knocked down like they're being sawed down by a top [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=91.02000000000001s)]
*  of the line timberman like, you know, who? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=96.26s)]
*  Sean Duffy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=100.26s)]
*  Do you know that Sean Duffy, the head of the transportation department who's working right [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=101.26s)]
*  now on the airports and getting a system because Biden didn't do a thing for four years and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=105.58000000000001s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg was the head and he goes bicycling to work. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=111.18s)]
*  To be in the mind of the two people sitting next to Trump during those remarks, what were [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=117.34s)]
*  they thinking? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=121.58000000000001s)]
*  So that was Donald Trump today. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=122.66000000000001s)]
*  He was, of course, representing the United States of America on an official state visit [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=123.66000000000001s)]
*  to Qatar. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=127.94000000000001s)]
*  To be clear, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy was not at this event, had absolutely [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=129.18s)]
*  nothing to do with it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=133.22s)]
*  This is a roundtable with military contractors. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=134.68s)]
*  And since we don't have an official transcript of those remarks from the White House, let [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=137.86s)]
*  me just read you some of that back to you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=141.18s)]
*  Here it is, quote. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=143.66s)]
*  You hide behind a tree and the drone comes down and it circles you with fire. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=145.26s)]
*  You don't have a chance. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=149.66s)]
*  The tree comes down also, by the way. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=150.89999999999998s)]
*  It's so intense. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=153.1s)]
*  I mean, you see these trees being knocked down like, like they're being sawed down by [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=154.1s)]
*  a top of the line timberman like, like, you know, who? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=158.34s)]
*  Sean Duffy, the head of the transportation department who's working right now on the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=162.22s)]
*  airports and getting a system because Biden didn't do a thing for four years and Pete [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=165.98s)]
*  Buttigieg was the head and he goes bicycle into work. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=170.38s)]
*  OK. If you think I'm cherry picking the weirdest thing Trump said today or I'm leaving out [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=175.3s)]
*  words, trust you, I'm not. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=181.1s)]
*  We played it for you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=182.34s)]
*  I read it for you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=183.38s)]
*  He also repeated his weird line about how the word groceries is an old fashioned term [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=184.82s)]
*  nobody uses anymore. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=188.86s)]
*  And he inexplicably claimed Hitler gave a speech at the Eiffel Tower, which, of course, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=190.46s)]
*  never happened again. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=194.82s)]
*  All of that was just today, which is to say nothing about all the strange things he said [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=196.26s)]
*  since taking office again. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=201.02s)]
*  And instead of using hydraulic like on tractors that can handle anything from hurricanes [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=202.18s)]
*  to to lightning to anything, they use magnets. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=207.94s)]
*  It's a new theory. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=212.3s)]
*  Magnets are going to lift the planes up and it doesn't work. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  So we've opened up the shower heads, the faucets, the toilets, seriously overweight, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  and he takes the fat, the fat shot drug. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=223.98000000000002s)]
*  This is a different panel than I've had. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=227.9s)]
*  Everything's computer. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=230.38s)]
*  I hear so much about the word groceries. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=231.38s)]
*  I used to use groceries a lot on that trail. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=233.38s)]
*  A word that's like sort of an old fashioned word groceries. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=236.38s)]
*  But groceries is the word that's the most accurate word. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=240.38s)]
*  Basically, what we're doing is equalizing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=243.38s)]
*  There's a new word that I came up with, which I think is probably the best word. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=245.38s)]
*  It sort of represents something that's both horrible and beautiful and strong and miserable [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=248.38s)]
*  weak. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=255.78s)]
*  OK, see, all of that goes a long way toward explaining why the Trump White House might [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=256.78s)]
*  not want an official record of all the things he said posted on the White House website [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=261.78s)]
*  and blasted out to reporters every time he's speaking. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=266.78s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=269.78s)]
*  These transcripts are not just some perfunctory thing that White House has put out when they [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=270.78s)]
*  feel like. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=274.78s)]
*  I mean, for decades, presidents of both parties have had their public statements recorded [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=275.78s)]
*  and transcribed by nonpartisan civil servants who serve as stenographers. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=279.78s)]
*  They literally travel with presidents everywhere they go. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=283.78s)]
*  And the transcripts are then sent out to the full White House press list, typically within [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=286.78s)]
*  hours and also posted on the White House website. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=290.78s)]
*  It's an important part of what it means for an administration to be transparent, to make [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=293.78s)]
*  sure the press and the American public have an official record of remarks from the leader [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=297.78s)]
*  of the free world. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=301.78s)]
*  Now, when HuffPost asked the White House a pretty simple question about why they were [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=302.78s)]
*  publishing these transcripts so infrequently, they came up with a very simple answer. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=307.78s)]
*  So, infrequently, they got this response from the ever-charming White House communications [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=312.78s)]
*  director Stephen Chung. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=316.78s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=317.78s)]
*  Or here's part of what he said. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=318.78s)]
*  You must be truly effing stupid if you think we're not transparent. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=319.78s)]
*  Stop becloning yourself. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=323.78s)]
*  I think Stephen Chung may need some fresh air. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=325.78s)]
*  Maybe he goes and bicycle into work, as his boss might suggest. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=328.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxaGebfNmI&t=342.78s)]
