This as President Trump’s budget bill, which could balloon the debt even further, faces tests in Congress. Bloomberg Opinion Senior Executive Editor Tim O’Brien joins Alex Witt to discuss.

# ‘Artful dodging’: Bloomberg editor questions Treasury Secy. over laying U.S. debt at Biden’s feet
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g)
*  New reaction today from the Trump administration over Moody's credit agency decision to downgrade [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=0.0s)]
*  the U.S. credit rating. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=6.04s)]
*  So here's Treasury Secretary Scott Besson just a short time ago on NBC's Meet the Press. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=7.32s)]
*  First of all, I think that Moody's is a lagging indicator. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=13.58s)]
*  We didn't get here in the past hundred days. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=17.44s)]
*  It's the Biden administration and the spending that we have seen over the past four years. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  We inherited 6.7% deficit to GDP, the highest when we weren't in a recession, not in the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=26.46s)]
*  war, and we are determined to bring the spending down and grow the economy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=33.74s)]
*  Joining me now is Bloomberg Opinion Senior Executive Editor and MSNBC political analyst, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=39.9s)]
*  our friend Tim O'Brien. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  Tim, welcome. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  So Moody's is the last of the three main credit agencies to downgrade the U.S. credit rating, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  and it's pointing to decades of Washington's failure to address the country's financial [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=50.86s)]
*  challenges, and that includes lowering the national debt and underfunding programs like [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=55.339999999999996s)]
*  Social Security and Medicare. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=60.099999999999994s)]
*  As to why it made the decision now, Moody's specifically referred to the trillions in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=62.459999999999994s)]
*  tax cuts Republicans are seeking in President Trump's big, beautiful spending package. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=67.89999999999999s)]
*  How will that downgrade affect our economy? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=73.14s)]
*  Well, it'll make it more expensive, Alex, for the federal government to finance its [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=75.74s)]
*  own debt. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=80.78s)]
*  If a household was living on credit cards and the interest rate went up on a credit [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=82.26s)]
*  card, your monthly bills would become more expensive and you'd spend more of your income [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=87.38s)]
*  as a homeowner on just paying off your credit card debt each month. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=92.7s)]
*  It's the same principle as work with the federal government. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=96.34s)]
*  It funds all sorts of public projects by issuing debt, and when the interest rate goes up on [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=99.74000000000001s)]
*  the debt, more of taxpayer dollars has to go to servicing the debt than spending the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  money on the services themselves. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=111.14s)]
*  It's now one of the biggest categories of public spending in the United States, just [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=112.97999999999999s)]
*  servicing the federal debt alongside Social Security, defense spending, Medicaid, Medicare. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=116.86s)]
*  Debt financing is a huge category of how tax dollars are being spent. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=122.58s)]
*  Now, Scott Vesin just did a little article dodging there when he said that this mountain [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  of debt was left by Biden. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=133.78s)]
*  Certainly COVID spending in the Biden administration and then public infrastructure spending in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=135.06s)]
*  the Biden administration added to the national debt. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=141.06s)]
*  But that was preceded by mountains of debt that were also added to the federal deficit [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=144.46s)]
*  by the Trump administration preceding Biden. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=150.02s)]
*  Both of them added trillions of dollars to the federal debt. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=153.7s)]
*  It's now around thirty six trillion dollars. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=157.66s)]
*  The deficit last year was about one point eight trillion dollars. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=161.06s)]
*  And there's a budget bill being negotiated right now, and the tax cuts envisioned in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=166.22s)]
*  that budget bill, along with various spending managans, is going to probably add another [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=171.82000000000002s)]
*  four to five trillion dollars to the deficit. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=176.74s)]
*  And they're not they're not they're simply misleading viewers about about the nature [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=181.82s)]
*  of this problem. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=188.46s)]
*  I'm going to get to that bill. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=189.46s)]
*  Let me just say you've perfectly crystallized what the problem is with the credit downgrade [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=190.66s)]
*  when you say it is like living on a credit card and the interest goes up and you have [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=195.18s)]
*  to pay more to pay it off. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=199.38s)]
*  That's everyone can understand that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  Let's get to what happened Friday relative to that bill. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=204.86s)]
*  The hotliners, they block block the mega bill from advancing for not cutting enough [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=207.66s)]
*  spending. And the concerns about what you reference, the trillions that it adds to the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=213.10000000000002s)]
*  national debt. Can the rating downgrade play into negotiations on the bill? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=217.34s)]
*  Will Trump have to get involved beyond just posting on social? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=222.46s)]
*  Do you expect to see a bunch of Republican lawmakers, you know, make their way to the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=226.42s)]
*  White House for meetings with the president? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=230.14s)]
*  I think they can. But what this has revealed is it's probably going to be impossible for [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=232.94s)]
*  Republicans to get a bill through without collaborating with Democrats. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  And that has been true for quite some time. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=242.85999999999999s)]
*  And Mike Johnson has proven that that he is not very effective at reaching out across [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=245.9s)]
*  the aisle to cut a deal to get a bill across that makes fiscal sense. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=251.78s)]
*  Trump can get involved, but Trump has very little sway with Democrats. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=257.54s)]
*  And he could he could he could tell hardliners in the GOP the MAGA wing of the GOP to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=261.82s)]
*  back down. But it's not clear that people like Chip Roy, for example, are going to listen [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=268.74s)]
*  to Donald Trump. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=273.46000000000004s)]
*  Let me get to what the White House is claiming, which is that Donald Trump secured more than [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=275.62s)]
*  two trillion dollars in investments this during his four day Middle East trip. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=279.26s)]
*  But The Washington Post reports to him that many of these deals were actually made before [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=283.58s)]
*  Trump took office. And the sum of these investments is less than half of White House [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=287.82s)]
*  claims. What is your understanding of what the president actually accomplished on his [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=293.29999999999995s)]
*  tour? Well, it's always hard now, Alex, with this president, because Donald Trump's [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  own personal investments and his his private companies, personal investments are [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=303.62s)]
*  tied into the very countries he's visiting. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=309.26s)]
*  And in recent weeks, he's cut new deals in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Dubai. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=312.18s)]
*  And those are happening to be the three countries that he visited on this trip. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=318.42s)]
*  So it's hard to one simply ascertain whether or not he's choosing to visit these [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=322.98s)]
*  countries to line his own wallet or to serve the public interest in the United States. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=328.38s)]
*  Also, his administration has made an art out of claiming large numbers around [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=334.86s)]
*  savings that they procured in the U.S. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=340.74s)]
*  his own public spending or deals they've they've secured from outside the country for [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=343.38s)]
*  investments in the U.S. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=349.86s)]
*  They constantly inflated or misrepresented those numbers. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=351.34s)]
*  So I think any time they make a claim now about an investment in the United States, it has to be taken with a grain of salt. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=355.3s)]
*  And then we don't really know what Trump's motivation is in any of this, because of all of his [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=361.86s)]
*  personal financial conflicts that are at work. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=366.18s)]
*  Let me quickly just get into the nuts and bolts of that, because Trump's sons, Don Jr. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=369.66s)]
*  and Eric, they are pursuing billions in the family business ventures in the region. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=373.38s)]
*  To your point, a luxury hotel in Dubai, residential tower in Jeddah, new golf course and villa [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=377.54s)]
*  complex in Qatar. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=382.94s)]
*  The White House says there are no ethics issues because Trump's sons run the business. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=384.58s)]
*  But what do you make of these investments happening while Trump is president and visiting as [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=389.62s)]
*  the head of state? And will Donald Trump at some point profit from these ventures? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=394.29999999999995s)]
*  Well, of course, he's going to profit from it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=400.46s)]
*  And that's why his sons are acting as his proxy in these deals. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=402.14s)]
*  They have set on some of the deals that the states that they are that Trump is doing [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=406.41999999999996s)]
*  diplomatic work in aren't involved in the business deals. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=410.66s)]
*  That is not true. They're involved through sovereign wealth funds or state controlled [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=413.54s)]
*  real estate firms. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=418.90000000000003s)]
*  The founding fathers would be spinning in their graves. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=421.06s)]
*  The Constitution never envisioned people with this kind of wealth or business interests [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=424.26000000000005s)]
*  securing the presidency. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=429.66s)]
*  In the 20th century, presidents of the federal government tried to make up for that problem [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=431.26000000000005s)]
*  by presidents voluntarily setting up blind trusts and having others manage their wealth [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=436.86s)]
*  or business interests. Trump has chosen to do neither of those things. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=443.42s)]
*  So there's no guardrails here, Alex. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=446.86s)]
*  OK, Tim O'Brien, there'll be a lot to talk about together in the future. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=449.1s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this Sunday. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLqh7hy_73g&t=452.46s)]
