# Rep. Doggett: Trump’s ‘big beautiful bill’ contains some ‘ugly details’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA)
*  House Republicans will try once again to make progress on President Trump's so-called one big beautiful bill [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=0.0s)]
*  Conservative Republicans blocked the bill from advancing to the House floor on Friday [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=7.2s)]
*  They want even steeper cuts to Medicaid [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=11.8s)]
*  The big beautiful bill is already estimated to leave millions uninsured [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson wants it passed by Memorial Day [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=19.3s)]
*  With that in mind the House Budget Committee will burn the midnight oil and meet tonight at 10 p.m [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=23.3s)]
*  You know, they're not like working on the weekends [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=28.86s)]
*  I know I don't want to work at 10 p.m. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=30.5s)]
*  They hold another vote on the package joining us now is a member of that committee Democratic Congressman Lloyd Doggett of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=31.86s)]
*  Texas Congressman, thank you so much for joining us early for you because you have a late night ahead of you [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=38.74s)]
*  Why do you think you guys are looking at this as 10 p.m. On a Sunday night? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=43.7s)]
*  Well, we were assured we would not be meeting today as recently as the conclusion of our meeting on Friday [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=47.86s)]
*  I think the speaker is under a great deal of pressure to deliver and here's another battle between the far-right and the not-so-right [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=53.82s)]
*  Republicans over one big beautiful bill that's really full of ugly details [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=61.46000000000001s)]
*  and so they I think ultimately the the far-right will [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=66.34s)]
*  Will fold as they did on the original budget resolution and the moderates will fold and they may push their bill through but there's no [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=70.94s)]
*  Certainty to it. It was a little surprising on Friday when as many as three or four members held out [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=77.94s)]
*  Are you aware that the concessions are actually to be more cut steeper cuts to Medicaid and not like a you know [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=83.34s)]
*  When the when rollback start well, I think the idea is to move them up and yes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=88.86s)]
*  They want more and they also not only do they want to deny health care to so many of our neighbors [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=93.26s)]
*  But they want to eliminate the great renewable credits that are generating jobs all over the country and helping us respond to the climate crisis [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=98.94s)]
*  Their concern about our budget deficit is not misplaced [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=107.42s)]
*  I share that we had over almost a trillion dollars in interest paid last year [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=112.3s)]
*  The solution is where we differ not on the danger of a debt [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=117.58s)]
*  They talk fiscal responsibility, but they practice fiscal irresponsibility [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=122.06s)]
*  And according to committee for a responsible budget [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=126.26s)]
*  The only question is how many trillions of dollars they add to our national debt at the same time? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=128.98s)]
*  They're doing so much harm to health care and renewable energy and on that point and congressmen [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=135.14s)]
*  Big piece of news dropped on Friday Moody's downgraded the US credit rating [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=140.58s)]
*  On on government debt. Do you see that as a message from the from Moody's? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=145.9s)]
*  Which is the third rating agency to downgrade America's credit as a message to Congress and particularly [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=151.82s)]
*  Republicans in Congress as they try to push this this bill that the president says he wants [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=159.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, I do and it's a message of concern because when we begin spending more on interest on the federal debt [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=164.58s)]
*  Than we do on defense. There's a problem and with Trump's erratic economic policies [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=171.86s)]
*  Generating higher interest rates that number may soar. I believe we need to address the national debt [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=177.58s)]
*  But there's a way to do that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  We can cut the bill the size of this bill in half and deliver every tax cut [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=185.66000000000003s)]
*  Republicans say they want the good bad and many ugly provisions in there for half the cost [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  So long as we limit the benefits to the 98% of Americans who earn [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=196.72s)]
*  $400,000 and less I think that Elon Musk and the billionaire class that were on parade at the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=202.52s)]
*  inauguration don't need another tax break [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  And if we just limited the size and the those who receive the benefit [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  To middle and upper middle and some fairly prosperous Americans [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=218.44s)]
*  We don't have to make the huge cuts in health care in renewable tax credits and we can be more fiscally responsible [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=222.67999999999998s)]
*  You know [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=229.92s)]
*  You can't meet with a group of Republicans to talk about the budget deficit without hearing them rave about the size of this deficit [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  And yet they're proposing four to seven trillion dollars [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=236.92s)]
*  Which really may endanger the Social Security Trust Fund if this continues to build up [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=240.48s)]
*  Congressman there's such tension [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=246.12s)]
*  Among Republicans from the deficit Hawks and then you have senators like Josh Hawley who are saying [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=248.68s)]
*  Politically, this is just not going to be good for our constituents. We have to preserve Medicaid [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  Let's play a little sound from him from what he said recently on this [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=261.8s)]
*  It ought to be just a basic foundational principle [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=266.52s)]
*  It is wrong to cut health care for the working poor and that's what we're talking about here with Medicaid [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=269.36s)]
*  My state is a Medicaid expansion state over 20% of Missourians including hundreds of thousands of children are on Medicaid [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=274.36s)]
*  We're not talking here about just work requirements. The house goes much much much further than that. This is real Medicaid benefit cuts [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=281.08s)]
*  I can't support that. No Republicans should support that. We're the party of the working-class mono. We need to act like it [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=287.96s)]
*  Congressman how are they gonna come together? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=294.52s)]
*  Well, they'll have difficulty coming together, but both sides usually end up folding [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=297.6s)]
*  You know, it's maybe surprising to some to hear Josh Hawley say that but rural hospitals are closing all over this country and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=301.96s)]
*  Getting access to health care for many rural [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=309.79999999999995s)]
*  Anglo members as well as people of color is really important in a prosperous community like I represent, Austin, Texas [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  half the babies born there are [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=320.44s)]
*  Reliant on financing from because of Medicaid and so in the rural areas [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=323.67999999999995s)]
*  It's even more significant in addition to the Medicaid cuts are the changes the refusal to continue the enhanced [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=329.24s)]
*  tax credits for the marketplace plans that means many people that are relying on the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=336.76s)]
*  Obamacare marketplace to get their health insurance [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  They're going to lose out in only seven months because of what Republicans are doing a total of almost 14 million Americans [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=346.4s)]
*  Denied access to a family physician and vital medications [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=354.24s)]
*  Congressman there is a myth a rumor a dog whistle that folks who are on Medicaid [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=358.16s)]
*  Are people who are taking advantage of the system there, you know, they're able-bodied people were dang [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  I know children they're just running around us getting health care when they could get it from someone else [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=369.72s)]
*  But I want to pull up some I want to fact-check that a little bit Kaiser Family Foundation. We have some polling [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=373.68s)]
*  64% of Medicaid covered adults work full or part-time [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=379.12s)]
*  Of working part-time [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=383.44s)]
*  60 to 20 percent full-time 44 percent not working due to retirement inability to find work or other reason 8% [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=385.48s)]
*  Not working due to school attendance 7% not working due to illness or a disability [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=392.36s)]
*  10% not working due to caregiving 12% [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=396.72s)]
*  Those are the facts and you know Republicans like to promote this myth that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=401.8s)]
*  Everyone relying on Medicare is Medicaid is just lazy and it's it is a myth [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=406.44s)]
*  What's behind the myth? Why do you think they like to do that dog? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=411.76s)]
*  They like some excuse for what they're doing and they want to identify this program strictly with people of color [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  It plays on the overall racism of this admit. That is the the market mark of this administration [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=422.24s)]
*  Medicaid is providing care to so many [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=428.84s)]
*  Seniors who rely on this who actually would not be able to be in a nursing home [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=432.64s)]
*  One of the ways they pay of course for this bill [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=438.47999999999996s)]
*  They say is to take the nurses out of nursing homes and not support the adequate staffing there [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  But it is a myth that they continue to promote just as they promote the myth that they're doing something [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=446.4s)]
*  To address the budget deficit when they're actually making it worse [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=452.03999999999996s)]
*  Congressman Lloyd docket. Thank you so much for being with us today and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=456.91999999999996s)]
*  You [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KxGdV9YpA&t=468.4s)]
