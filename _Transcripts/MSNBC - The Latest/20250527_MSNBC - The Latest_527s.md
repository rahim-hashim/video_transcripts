# Trump 'doesn't have a coherent strategy' for Russia-Ukraine war: Aaron David Miller
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU)
*  And also at the White House this morning, rising frustration as negotiations on multiple international crises failed to produce any dramatic breakthroughs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=0.0s)]
*  Russia actually suggested President Trump has, quote, emotional overload after the president accused Vladimir Putin of going absolutely crazy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=9.0s)]
*  This back and forth after Russia launched its largest air assault on Ukraine over the weekend since the stalled peace talks began. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=18.0s)]
*  The president also targeting Ukraine's President Zelensky, writing, everything out of his mouth causes problems. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=25.0s)]
*  At the same time, diplomacy is stuck in the Middle East, where President Trump's envoy outright dismissed reports that Hamas agreed to a ceasefire, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=31.0s)]
*  calling it Hamas spin amid deepening tensions between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=40.0s)]
*  And of course, there's the trade wars. President waffling on his latest terror threat against the EU as trade negotiations play out there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=46.0s)]
*  Much to discuss with NBC News White House correspondent Von Hilliard, international correspondent Matt Bradley in Tel Aviv, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=55.0s)]
*  and Aaron David Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=61.0s)]
*  and former State Department analysts who advised on negotiations like these. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=66.0s)]
*  So, Von, this is a very different tone from the president as far as Putin goes. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=70.0s)]
*  And we know this president often sees himself as the negotiator in chief. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=76.0s)]
*  It's a different tone than what we've heard from Donald Trump for the last decade, Anna, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=81.0s)]
*  one in which he has repeatedly deferred to Russian President Vladimir Putin and has exhibited trust in the Russian president's leadership [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=85.0s)]
*  and his willingness to collaborate or negotiate any sorts of deals with the United States and with specifically his White House. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=96.0s)]
*  And that is why on Sunday, the social media post is noteworthy because really for the first time we're hearing from the president of the United States, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=105.0s)]
*  President Trump, specifically calling out President Putin as, quote, crazy and notably suggesting that he believes that Putin wants to take over all of Ukraine [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=114.0s)]
*  and that if he were to do so, quote, it will lead to the downfall of Russia. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=124.0s)]
*  That is about the most explicit threat that we have heard from Trump in the direction of Putin if he does not agree to some type of a ceasefire, stand down agreement with Ukraine. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=129.0s)]
*  At the same time, there are no specifics in terms of retaliation or sanctions or other efforts on behalf of the United States and other European allies. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=138.0s)]
*  If Russia does not stand down over the weekend, we saw more than one hundred and thirty missiles launched in the direction of Kiev, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=150.0s)]
*  air strikes that have only escalated this war against Ukraine. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=156.0s)]
*  And while Keith Kellogg here today suggested that there is a potential Putin, Zelensky, Trump meeting down the road, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=160.0s)]
*  including a high level meeting that could take place soon in Geneva, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=167.0s)]
*  there has been little to suggest that Putin is willing to make any concessions. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=173.0s)]
*  As Kellogg noted here today, that Ukraine has provided a list of potential concessions in a pathway toward a deal. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=179.0s)]
*  But Russia at this point has yet to do so itself. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=187.0s)]
*  And I am just looking at the quote from Keith Kellogg saying, you know, the Russians said they'd come up with a memo, what I call a term sheet. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=190.0s)]
*  And I think we have his sound. So let's listen to him say it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=200.0s)]
*  The Russians said they were going to come up with what they call a memorandum. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=204.0s)]
*  What I call a term sheet, what a term sheet means is, OK, this is how we get to peace. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=207.0s)]
*  We've got that from the Ukrainian side. We need to get that from the Russian side. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=212.0s)]
*  And then what you do is you meld them together. You put them together. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=216.0s)]
*  So lots of back and forth with officials in both countries here in the US from Keith Kellogg. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=220.0s)]
*  That's the latest on the US side. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=225.0s)]
*  And Russia has said that this is all going to shift again when Trump sees that the EU is, quote, starting to sabotage his efforts for peace. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=227.0s)]
*  And it was a week ago there was that very friendly phone call between Trump and Putin. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=235.0s)]
*  Now Trump's calling Putin crazy. So what do you make about make of this shifting dynamic? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=239.0s)]
*  Look, in order to have a successful negotiation, you need at least three things. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=244.0s)]
*  Number one, you need two parties who are actually willing and able to negotiate. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=250.0s)]
*  You need a doable deal and you need a third party mediator that comes up with an effective, coherent strategy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=254.0s)]
*  In Russia, Ukraine, frankly, you do not have two parties that are interested in a deal. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=261.0s)]
*  Vladimir Putin might agree to end the fighting if he got what he wanted, but he's not going to agree to end the war. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=266.0s)]
*  And the president, who's interested in a quick and easy fix, I think would basically buy into that if he could get Putin to comply. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=273.0s)]
*  And he can't. And one additional point. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=282.0s)]
*  These are not easy lifts. US, Iran, Israel, Hamas, Russia, Ukraine. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=285.0s)]
*  I mean, you could invite two of the best negotiators that American side ever produced. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=291.0s)]
*  Henry Kissinger is one and my former boss, James Baker, to come back and do these deals and they would be challenged. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=296.0s)]
*  So, again, negotiations require ample amounts of honey. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=303.0s)]
*  You've got to provide incentives, but they also require ample amounts of vinegar. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=308.0s)]
*  You've got to be able and willing to pressure and provide disincentives. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=313.0s)]
*  The president doesn't have a coherent strategy when it comes to Russia, Ukraine. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=317.0s)]
*  So the odds of doing a deal diminish accordingly. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=321.0s)]
*  And Matt, let's talk about the latest there in the Middle East. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=324.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is hinting that he could soon announce another possible hostage deal. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=327.0s)]
*  But the IDF hasn't let up on its bombardment of Gaza. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=332.0s)]
*  So where do those negotiations stand? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=335.0s)]
*  That's right. And Witkoff, Steve Witkoff poured cold water on the Reuters report yesterday that said that Hamas had agreed to some sort of deal. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=339.0s)]
*  The Witkoff plan. And in fact, our own Garrett Haig spoke with Steve Witkoff and he said there is no Witkoff plan. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=345.0s)]
*  So all of this looks like kind of jerking back and forth. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=352.0s)]
*  The family members of the hostages were very upset and released statements about Netanyahu basically saying that there was going to be some sort of deal. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=355.0s)]
*  He said this yesterday that there could be a deal yesterday or today. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=364.0s)]
*  It's already six o'clock here and we haven't heard of any kind of deal. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=367.0s)]
*  So it looks like the Israelis are giving out a lot of false hope as well as Hamas doing the same thing. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=371.0s)]
*  But in the Gaza Strip, where so many people are under bombardment, more than two million and have endured now 12 weeks of mostly a blockade, it broke about last week, 11 weeks in, there were signs of starvation and famine. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=377.0s)]
*  Now we're starting to see a trickle of aid going in as the Israelis have loosened that blockade. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=392.0s)]
*  But aid groups have said it's not nearly enough. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=396.0s)]
*  And we've just heard of a U.S. plan or a U.S.-backed plan to start distributing aid and a U.S. group, an American group, which has the support of the Israeli Defense Forces, is now distributing aid in about four places, they said, or the IDF said, throughout the Gaza Strip, most of them in the south. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=398.0s)]
*  And what we just heard from our team in the Gaza Strip, who've been doing incredibly brave work watching all of this, they said that at one of the facilities, one of the sites, the distribution centers, where this American group, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=415.0s)]
*  the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, was distributing aid, they were overwhelmed by people who mobbed the scene. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=426.0s)]
*  They fled amidst the crush of the crowd. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=433.0s)]
*  And everyone in the crowd simply grabbed at the food and the aid and basically looted the facility. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=436.0s)]
*  So they've described this as the first failure, our team there, of the aid distribution effort that's backed by the United States. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=443.0s)]
*  So as you can see, fits and starts when it comes to getting aid in with a U.S.-backed plan. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=450.0s)]
*  Erin, this is all a delicate dance, very complicated one. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=456.0s)]
*  At the core, these negotiations are existential, right? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=459.0s)]
*  A short-term deal, is that more realistic than a transformative agreement? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=463.0s)]
*  Lana, you know, I think you broke the code. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=468.0s)]
*  We're talking here at best, at best if you can get it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=471.0s)]
*  And Israeli-Palestinian negotiations really only have two speeds, slow and slower. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=474.0s)]
*  At best, you can get another limited release of hostages for an indefinite number of days for a ceasefire. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=479.0s)]
*  But ending the war, that is to say, literally creating a situation in which you have better governance, security, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=485.0s)]
*  and the beginnings of the galactic lift on humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, that's not in the cards. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=493.0s)]
*  And frankly, I don't see that happening anytime soon. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=500.0s)]
*  Erin, David Miller, Vaughn Hilliard, Matt Bradley, thank you all very much. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=503.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCpHkmL-zfU&t=523.0s)]
