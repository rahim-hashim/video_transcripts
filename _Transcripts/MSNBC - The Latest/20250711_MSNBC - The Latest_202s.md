# 'This is devastating': Mass layoffs at State Department have begun
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0)
*  We begin with the mass layoffs underway as we speak at the State Department. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to bring in NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=4.44s)]
*  I understand, Andrea, those termination notices began hitting in boxes this morning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=8.52s)]
*  What do we know about it? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=13.72s)]
*  Well, frankly, I have been covering the State Department officially since 1994, unofficially [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=15.56s)]
*  before that, as I covered different administrations from the White House and from the Hill. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=23.04s)]
*  And I have to tell you, this is devastating. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=27.56s)]
*  In a statement, the organization that represents foreign service officers, the diplomats who [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=30.04s)]
*  are also involved in this, as well as the civil service employees, each of those groups [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=35.64s)]
*  have their own protections. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=42.8s)]
*  Those who are being ignored and overruled by the Supreme Court decision, lifting a federal [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=44.16s)]
*  court injunction that had prevented this from happening. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=48.76s)]
*  There's been a lot of uncertainty. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=51.84s)]
*  Some people are expressing relief that at least now they know. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=53.6s)]
*  But in terms of the last six months, according to the Association of Foreign Service Officers, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=56.92s)]
*  the diplomats, 20 percent of our diplomats have been eliminated. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=63.4s)]
*  And they're not eliminated by decisions on merit or on language facility or on experience [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=67.52s)]
*  or on where they are serving in the world. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=73.98s)]
*  There are two wars going on and a lot of crises around the world. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=76.52s)]
*  They were just eliminated across the board without any kind of attention to how they've [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  achieved what their merit is, what their experience levels are. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=85.76s)]
*  And just to give you an example, the Afghan relocation service is being eliminated. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=89.06s)]
*  Well, that was legislated by Congress to not go out of business until 2027 for people who [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=93.64s)]
*  had worked in Afghanistan with our military, with our State Department, with our CIA, with [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=100.68s)]
*  the intelligence people. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=104.64s)]
*  Many of those people are still stranded in Doha and other places in Pakistan, unable [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=106.72s)]
*  to get here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=111.52s)]
*  They haven't been properly visaed. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=112.8s)]
*  So they have to return to Afghanistan, to the Taliban. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=114.88s)]
*  Having worked with the Americans during the war, you know what they face. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=118.24s)]
*  They face jail or execution. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=122.08s)]
*  So there's just so much involved here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=124.08s)]
*  And just one final example. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=127.0s)]
*  Right now there is terrible starvation and lack of fuel, lack of medical care in Gaza. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  And the State Department has been giving blanket support for this American and Israeli-supported [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=138.22s)]
*  humanitarian relief organization that's operating in four sites in southern Gaza only. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=145.1s)]
*  And there is widespread reporting, not only by the UN and by other agencies, but reporting [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=151.06s)]
*  by credible news sources as well as our own teams on the field in Gaza of horrific conditions. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=157.1s)]
*  And the State Department doesn't have the bandwidth or the will to have real facts coming [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=166.38s)]
*  from the ground. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=172.7s)]
*  They just keep saying, well, meals are being distributed when people are dying. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=173.7s)]
*  Andrea Mitchell, I know you'll keep on top of this story for us. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=178.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyWfU86RR0&t=181.01999999999998s)]
