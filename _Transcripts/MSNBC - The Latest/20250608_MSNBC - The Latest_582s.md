# Rep. Adam Smith: The President is 'doing this parade so people can kiss up to him'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8)
*  Russia is making good on its promise to retaliate against Ukraine for its daring drone assault, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=0.0s)]
*  which targeted several Russian air bases with strategic bombers last weekend. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=10.56s)]
*  Today, Moscow unleashed a barrage of drones and missiles striking Kharkiv, killing at [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  least three people and injuring more than 20 others, the city's mayor calling it the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=20.88s)]
*  most powerful attack since the war began. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=25.32s)]
*  On Friday, there was another deadly attack. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=28.4s)]
*  This one focused on the capital city of Kiev, signaling a dramatic escalation in the war. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=30.52s)]
*  While meeting with the German chancellor at the White House Thursday, President Trump [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=36.199999999999996s)]
*  compared Putin and Zelensky to two children fighting. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=40.36s)]
*  Sometimes, you see two young children fighting like crazy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  They hate each other and they're fighting in a park. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=49.92s)]
*  And you try and pull them apart. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=54.12s)]
*  They don't want to be pulled. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=55.44s)]
*  Sometimes you're better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=56.44s)]
*  And I gave that analogy to Putin yesterday. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=62.44s)]
*  I said, President, maybe you're going to have to keep fighting and suffering a lot because [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=65.52s)]
*  both sides, before you pull them apart. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=71.5s)]
*  Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Adam Smith. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=75.36s)]
*  He's the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=78.16s)]
*  Congressman, what did you make of the president's comparison that the war is like two children [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=81.92s)]
*  fighting and need to work out their differences? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, the president's ignorance of this situation is staggering. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=91.44s)]
*  It continues to astound with the way he says things and also incredibly costly because [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=96.64s)]
*  it's really very clear what's going on here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=101.28s)]
*  Putin wants control of Ukraine. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=103.64s)]
*  And he's not going to stop until one of two things happens. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=106.2s)]
*  Either A, he gets control of Ukraine, or B, it is made clear to him that he can't achieve [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=109.32s)]
*  that objective, which is why it is so important for the president to state that clearly. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  This is not some spat between two equal rivals who have just a difference of opinion. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=119.96s)]
*  This is a concerted effort by Putin to try to grab territory. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=125.28s)]
*  He basically wants to reestablish the Soviet Union. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=130.72s)]
*  And to stop him, we need to support Ukraine. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=135.24s)]
*  We need to be clear in that support. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=137.84s)]
*  The message that President Trump and J.D. Vance and others in the administration have [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  said, which basically is we're going to abandon Ukraine at some point, that is empowering Putin. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  Look, Ukraine has fought incredibly bravely. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=149.36s)]
*  We put together a great coalition to help them. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=151.56s)]
*  We can stop Putin, but not if the president keeps pulling the rug out from under Ukraine. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=153.96s)]
*  So to talk about that tactic of pulling the rug from out underneath Volodymyr Zelensky, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  every couple of days when things go sour for the way the president views Vladimir Putin, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=165.68s)]
*  he'll either tweet about it or he'll say, I'm shocked at the way Vladimir Putin is behaving. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=170.8s)]
*  And for most of us in the media and in the real world who have seen Vladimir Putin for [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  the last 20 years, it's not a surprise that Vladimir Putin is showing us who he really [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=179.84s)]
*  is. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=186.16s)]
*  Yet somehow the president of the United States always acts surprised that Vladimir Putin [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=187.16s)]
*  is turning out to be a bad guy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=191.08s)]
*  Yeah, no, you're exactly right. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=194.8s)]
*  There's nothing really terribly complicated. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=196.8s)]
*  I explained it in the answer to the first question. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=198.68s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=201.08s)]
*  I mean, we have to calculate what our interests are in that fight. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=202.08s)]
*  I think our interests are clear. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=205.4s)]
*  If Russia and Putin are able to, by military force, take territory and expand their power, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=207.96s)]
*  that's a bad thing for the world, and we should try and stop it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  But President Trump has no real interest in the background here, and it is costing us [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  dearly. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=222.0s)]
*  We have a very good coalition supporting Ukraine. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=223.04s)]
*  Ukraine is fighting incredibly well. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=227.04s)]
*  We can get to peace if we show resolve in supporting Ukraine. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=229.08s)]
*  The president—I mean, there's a whole bunch of different factors in why he's messing this [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=233.68s)]
*  up. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=236.96s)]
*  Let us not underestimate what I said up front. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=237.96s)]
*  The president is remarkably ignorant of things that don't immediately suit his ego. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=239.76s)]
*  So he may not know what's going on there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=245.84s)]
*  And then you've got the people who are sympathetic to Putin within the Republican Party. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=248.28s)]
*  And then you've got the vague notion that, well, we should try to get out of conflicts [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  all around the world, which I don't disagree with. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  But we're not actually in this conflict. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  We're trying to prevent a situation where more countries get drawn into it by supporting [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=260.47999999999996s)]
*  Ukraine and defending themselves. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=265.92s)]
*  So yeah, the president's national security approach is incredibly dangerous for the world [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=267.52s)]
*  and for our country. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=272.44s)]
*  Congressman, you alluded to a lot of Republicans in Congress being sympathetic to Putin. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  There have also been a number of aides within the White House who have been hostile, outwardly [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=279.36s)]
*  hostile to Zelensky. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=284.48s)]
*  Could you talk a little bit more about how much influence that support may be having [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=287.0s)]
*  or not having on President Trump? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=293.4s)]
*  And if you have any theories about why there is this strange set of bedfellows right now? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  First of all, let me make clear. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=303.44s)]
*  There is a substantial number of Republicans in the House and the Senate who support Ukraine, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  and they are strong on that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=312.16s)]
*  Mike Rogers, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, my counterpart, a very strong supporter [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  of Ukraine, a number of others as well. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=318.76s)]
*  But then you've got this weird strain within the Republican Party that is sympathetic to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=321.12s)]
*  Putin as sort of a white Christian nationalist, as he's portrayed himself. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=326.76s)]
*  Putin, he does a lot of bizarre propaganda about being anti-woke. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=333.32s)]
*  And then you have people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who are sympathetic to that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=339.72s)]
*  How large is that in the Republican Party? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=343.8s)]
*  I don't know, but it's obviously present. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=346.28s)]
*  Liz Cheney put it best as the pro-Putin wing of the Republican Party. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=348.56s)]
*  And I will say this, however large it is, they have a disproportionate level of influence [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=353.6s)]
*  within Trump's MAGA movement. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=358.72s)]
*  And that is hurting our ability to get to the right policy, even while you have national [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  security Republican, national security leaders in the House and the Senate who agree with [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=366.04s)]
*  everything that we're saying here. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=370.68s)]
*  They're just not the ones driving the ship at the White House right now, and that's a [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=372.84000000000003s)]
*  big problem. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  Congressman, next weekend on Saturday, Donald Trump is going to host a real boondoggle of [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=379.08000000000004s)]
*  a parade that cost about $40 million celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  Army, which I think we can all agree that's reason to celebrate. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=391.44s)]
*  But is there any talk of also doing this for the Marine Corps or for the Navy, who also [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=395.04s)]
*  have their 250th anniversary coming up? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=401.04s)]
*  Or is the cost, you know, and is the cost just not an issue or consideration for this [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=404.64000000000004s)]
*  administration? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, it's the Marine Corps' fault for not sharing a birthday with Donald Trump. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, I think that's the reason the Army is getting more of the celebration here. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=417.67999999999995s)]
*  And I don't think it's any particular insight on my part to point that out. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=421.52s)]
*  Look, Trump can dress this up any way he wants. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  And I know Republican colleagues of mine in the House are defending it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, the military does parades all the time, and it's not a big deal. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=431.12s)]
*  They don't do parades that cost—and by the way, the figure I heard was $45 million—they [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=434.96s)]
*  don't do parades that cost $45 million are going to tear up the streets in downtown [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=439.04s)]
*  D.C. and just happen to coincide with President Trump's birthday. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=443.76000000000005s)]
*  While President Trump has actively said he admires leaders like Kim Jong-un and Putin [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=447.76000000000005s)]
*  because they get these big, huge parades celebrating them. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  This is a bad look for our government. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=457.6s)]
*  It is about Trump. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=460.24s)]
*  It is about moving towards a more autocratic approach to governing. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=461.36s)]
*  Tip of the iceberg, by the way, the parade. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=465.20000000000005s)]
*  You guys have documented the disappearing of people off the streets, the way he has [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=467.12s)]
*  weaponized the Justice Department, gone after law firms, gone after the media, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=471.92s)]
*  all in an autocratic way that is completely against the values of this country. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=476.0s)]
*  I'm not going to pretend that a parade is somehow the worst thing going on here, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=480.16s)]
*  but it fits the theme. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=484.88s)]
*  We are supposed to praise the dear leader as opposed to upholding the law, the Constitution, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=486.72s)]
*  and recognizing that that's what this nation is about, not about a cult of personality. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=492.24s)]
*  Make no mistake about it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=497.68s)]
*  He's doing this parade so that people can kiss up to him. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=498.96000000000004s)]
*  ARI I'm reluctant to ever ask a politician to comment on what the media should do, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  but what do you think journalists and media organizations should do next Saturday? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  Should they cover this parade that this president, as you describe, is cloaking himself in to make [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=514.48s)]
*  it about him and to have a dear leader moment and give him that imagery that he wants? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=519.36s)]
*  Or what do you think the media should do? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  TREVOR I don't think they should do that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=525.6s)]
*  I think they should make the points that I've made and point out exactly what this is about. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=528.4s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=533.92s)]
*  I can't dictate to the media how to cover things. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=534.8000000000001s)]
*  But look, Trump's going after the media, too. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=537.6s)]
*  This is all part of the effort, that the point, whether you're talking about Harvard, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=540.16s)]
*  whether you're talking about the media, whether you're talking about the law firms, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=544.72s)]
*  just acquiescing to Trump's demands just walks us down the road of the autocracy that he wants [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=548.16s)]
*  to create. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=554.24s)]
*  I think if you believe in representative democracy and freedom, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  you should fight back against that, whoever you are. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N01yw8oq7p8&t=558.88s)]
