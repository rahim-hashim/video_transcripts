# BREAKING: Minnesota lawmaker killed and another injured in 'politically motivated' shootings
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI)
*  My good friend and colleague, Speaker Melissa Ohnen and her husband Mark, were shot and killed early this morning in what appears to be a politically motivated assassination. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=0.0s)]
*  Our state lost a great leader, and I lost a dearest of friends. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=9.0s)]
*  Speaker Hortman was someone who served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, humor, and a sense of service. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=14.0s)]
*  She was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=22.0s)]
*  She woke up every day determined to make this state a better place. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=28.0s)]
*  She is irreplaceable and we've been missed by so many. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=33.0s)]
*  Minnesota's thoughts and prayers are with her family, her loved ones, her children, and her parents. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=37.0s)]
*  My prayers also go out to State Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, who were each shot multiple times. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=43.0s)]
*  The Hoffmans are out of surgery at this time and receiving care, and we are cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=52.0s)]
*  This was an act of targeted political violence. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=61.0s)]
*  Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=65.0s)]
*  We don't settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=71.0s)]
*  In the state of Minnesota, and as recently as last week, in the most closely divided state legislature in the country, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=76.0s)]
*  we sat down, we worked things out, we debated, we shook hands and compromised, and we served the state of Minnesota together. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=83.0s)]
*  We proved that it's possible, even in these politically charged times, to find compromise and adhere to the principles of democracy and civil discourse. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=93.0s)]
*  We must all, Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=103.0s)]
*  At this precipice moment we're on, this tragic act here in Minnesota should serve as a reminder to all of us. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=110.0s)]
*  The democracy and the debates in the halls of Congress, in state houses, in school boards, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=120.0s)]
*  is a way to settle our differences peacefully and move society to a better place. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=128.0s)]
*  We're collaborating with all local, state and federal agencies on a full investigation. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=134.0s)]
*  We're committed to keeping Minnesotans informed as the situation continues. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=141.0s)]
*  I assure you that those held, those responsible for this will be held accountable, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=146.0s)]
*  and each and every one of us are committed to making sure that a tragedy like this never repeats itself in Minnesota or across this country. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=153.0s)]
*  There was an original call in the city of Champlain where there was an individual that had shot Senator Hoffman and his wife. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=161.0s)]
*  Police responded to that location, they were dealing with that and working through that process overnight. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=168.0s)]
*  And then later on, at approximately 3.35, another call came in when it was officers proactively checking [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=174.0s)]
*  because they knew of the incident that occurred and they were going to check on Speaker Hoffman at that time, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=181.0s)]
*  at which time Brooklyn Park police officers encountered an individual who immediately fired at them and they exchanged gunfire [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=190.0s)]
*  and then the individual was able to escape during that exchange of gunfire. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=199.0s)]
*  The circumstances unfolded in Brooklyn Park this morning is that we assisted the Champlain Police Department on a shooting. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=203.0s)]
*  That shooting was made aware by one of our sergeants that it was at Senator Hoffman's home. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=209.0s)]
*  In hearing that, that very intuitive sergeant asked our officers to go check on Melissa Hortman's home, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=214.0s)]
*  a representative that lives in our community, just proactively as due diligence to swing by. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=221.0s)]
*  That police officer and his partner pulled down the street when they arrived at Melissa's house. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=226.0s)]
*  They noticed that there was a police vehicle in the driveway with the lights, emergency lights on, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=231.0s)]
*  and what appeared to be a police officer at the door coming out of the house. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=235.0s)]
*  When our officers confronted them, the individual immediately fired upon the officers who exchanged gunfire [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=239.0s)]
*  and the suspect retreated back into the home. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=246.0s)]
*  Yes, the question is, was it a real person or impersonating an impersonating a police officer? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=249.0s)]
*  It was not a real police officer. This is somebody that clearly had been impersonating a police officer, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=254.0s)]
*  again, using the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=259.0s)]
*  Yes, the question is what kind of vehicle and how were they dressed? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=280.0s)]
*  They did drive a vehicle that looked exactly like an SUV squad car. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=286.0s)]
*  It was equipped with lights, emergency lights that looked exactly like a police vehicle. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=290.0s)]
*  And yes, they were wearing a vest with taser, other equipment that would, a badge very similar to mine, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=296.0s)]
*  that no question if they were in this room, you would assume that they are a police officer. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=304.0s)]
*  Yes, the question is, was it a real person or impersonating an impersonating a police officer? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=309.0s)]
*  Yes, the question is, was it a real person or impersonating a police officer? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPILW1J3XvI&t=314.0s)]
