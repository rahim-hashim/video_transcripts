# Trump 'clearly angry' at Amazon for move to display tariff cost next to products
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A)
*  Garrett, key White House officials were pressed about these tariffs and this new Amazon move [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=0.0s)]
*  just last hour. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=5.36s)]
*  What did they say? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=6.36s)]
*  Yeah, on the tariffs more broadly, you heard some optimism that there could be trade deals [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=7.36s)]
*  struck in the not too distant future from Treasury Secretary Scott Besson, who talked [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=11.76s)]
*  about the use of what he called, euphemistically, the president's strategic uncertainty in his [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=15.96s)]
*  negotiating position over time here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=21.12s)]
*  On Amazon, this report that Amazon might start listing the additional cost on specific items [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=23.84s)]
*  put in place by the tariffs, the president is clearly angry. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=29.8s)]
*  White House press secretary Caroline Levitt said she had spoken to him about it this morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=33.72s)]
*  And the question, the idea that this shows factually that it is American consumers who [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=37.88s)]
*  pay the cost of tariffs, not the Chinese or any other foreign government, seem to be the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=42.58s)]
*  thing that set off the president's anger. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=46.88s)]
*  Listen to how the White House press secretary addressed this issue. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=49.24s)]
*  I just got off the phone with the president about Amazon's announcement. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=52.56s)]
*  This is a hostile and political act by Amazon. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=57.52s)]
*  Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=61.92s)]
*  years? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  And I would also add that it's not a surprise because as Reuters recently wrote, Amazon [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  has partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=74.48s)]
*  So this is another reason why Americans should buy American. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=77.84s)]
*  So just to clarify, not an announcement from Amazon, just a report at this juncture and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=83.44s)]
*  something we should definitely watch closely given the White House's response to it and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  how much attention we've all been paying to the relationship between President Trump and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=92.0s)]
*  Amazon's multi-billionaire owner Jeff Bezos, now at least a bit rockier than it was this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=96.36s)]
*  time yesterday. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=101.16s)]
*  Yeah, Christine, before we go bigger picture on Trump's first 100 days, talk about Amazon [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=102.16s)]
*  and the potential price difference they could be highlighting if they indeed show what tariffs [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=107.25999999999999s)]
*  cost. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=113.16s)]
*  Well, if you have a 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods, any Chinese goods sold by Amazon [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=114.16s)]
*  then would have a higher cost. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=118.52s)]
*  I mean, you think of it this way. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=120.12s)]
*  You know, a $10,000 container of goods coming over would have a $14,500 tariff on it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=122.16s)]
*  We have I mean, that's more than the cost of the goods is the cost of the tariff. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=128.48s)]
*  That will clearly, clearly be a big cost difference for these sellers that are selling on Amazon. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=131.96s)]
*  What's interesting to me is you've already seen Temu and Shin raise their prices. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=137.4s)]
*  One of those low cost retailers actually putting right in the cart the cost of the import charge. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=142.72s)]
*  A lot of people had noticed that over the past couple of days. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=147.1s)]
*  So sort of breaking out the import charge. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=150.62s)]
*  So we may see more retailers start to do that, although you can see from the White House, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=152.6s)]
*  they're taking that if that were to happen at Amazon as a political move. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  It would be a sticker shock for consumers, though. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  Garrett, you also have reporting on tariff walkbacks, at least when it comes to the auto [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=162.66s)]
*  industry. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=168.45999999999998s)]
*  It's going to help the auto industry. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=169.45999999999998s)]
*  What do we know? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=170.45999999999998s)]
*  Well, on a that's the way the White House and the Commerce Department is framing this new [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=171.66s)]
*  decision today, which is to basically say that the president's 25 percent tariffs on [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=175.16s)]
*  automobiles and auto parts are the only tariffs that will apply to those businesses. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=179.66s)]
*  They won't be stacked, if you will, on top of tariffs on steel and aluminum, which are [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=184.62s)]
*  obviously key components in cars or added to tariffs that affect just Canada or just [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=189.10000000000002s)]
*  Mexico or just Germany, for example, places where we might import cars or parts. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=194.54000000000002s)]
*  The idea is to make it a little bit simpler, a little bit easier for these auto companies [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=200.42s)]
*  to invest in the United States, so says the White House. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=203.57999999999998s)]
*  But the price of cars is still going to go up. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=207.02s)]
*  And many of the companies, the big three, the domestic auto manufacturers and parts [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  manufacturers have responded tepidly, let's say, to this announcement. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=213.94s)]
*  It will help them. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=219.1s)]
*  But it's not the same as getting out from under these more burdensome tariffs on the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=220.22s)]
*  industry more broadly. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=223.84s)]
*  And Christine, the president has faced backlash on the economy, largely driven by the tariffs, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=225.54s)]
*  which continue to be a moving target, ruckus through the president's economic actions and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=230.7s)]
*  the impact in these first 100 days of his administration. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=234.94s)]
*  Well, it's really the rollout and the strategy and what people who are business people who [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  are going to be at the other end of his tariffs see as a haphazard kind of implementation [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=243.14s)]
*  of his tariffs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=247.54s)]
*  I mean, here's the recipe of what we have, our 145 percent of imports from China. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=248.54s)]
*  That is essentially grinding trade between the world's two biggest economies to a halt. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=252.7s)]
*  And that's where we'll be watching to see the goods that are still coming in. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=257.7s)]
*  At what point will you begin to see those import surcharges on your bills? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=260.58s)]
*  But the steel and aluminum, the USMCA, there already was a trade deal with Canada and Mexico [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=265.34s)]
*  that the president ripped up himself. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=271.26s)]
*  So that begs the question, you know, what kind of reliable trading partner is the U.S.? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=273.32s)]
*  So this is what's all on the table right now. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=278.46s)]
*  And then you look at what the stock market makes of that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=280.82s)]
*  As you pointed out in your intro, this is the worst performance for a first 100 days [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=283.52s)]
*  of a president since Richard Nixon, an almost 8 percent decline in the S&P 500 and royaled [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=287.61999999999995s)]
*  markets from the dollar and to the bond market as well. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=293.09999999999997s)]
*  So just an awful lot of uncertainty. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=296.46s)]
*  I will say there was a bank note this morning that said the first 100 days of dot, dot, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=298.97999999999996s)]
*  dot uncertainty. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=303.65999999999997s)]
*  So we'll see if there's more clarity from the president tonight about the next 100 days [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=304.65999999999997s)]
*  and what business and consumers can expect from that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=308.12s)]
*  And Shaq is joining us from the state where we'll see President Trump head later today, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=311.24s)]
*  the White House framing this first 100 days as a smashing economic success. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=316.4s)]
*  Shaq, the polls show otherwise. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=320.76s)]
*  You've spoken to Trump voters there in Michigan. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  Where do they land? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, Ana, in my conversations with Trump's biggest supporters here, they acknowledge [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  the reality that you guys are talking about. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=331.52s)]
*  They see and feel the impacts of the tariffs. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=334.04s)]
*  They see the softening market, the looming price increases because of the tariffs. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=337.0s)]
*  But they say they are sticking with him for multiple reasons. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=341.32s)]
*  One, they say this is what he promised on the campaign trail. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=344.52s)]
*  It came as no surprise to them, even with the impacts that we're talking about. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=347.28s)]
*  And two, they say that this is something that they believe in. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=351.84s)]
*  It's a mission they ultimately believe in and a goal of bringing back manufacturing [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=355.04s)]
*  to the United States. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=359.64s)]
*  Listen to how his supporters explained it to me. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=361.04s)]
*  Nobody likes to pay more for anything I don't. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=366.56s)]
*  But in the long run, I think it's going to be good. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=368.76s)]
*  The tariffs, they don't scare me at all. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=372.08s)]
*  My money went down just like everybody else's. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=374.72s)]
*  My investments in there coming right back up doesn't faze me a bit. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=376.62s)]
*  I know that as a country, we are, we owe a lot. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=380.56s)]
*  You know, we're in a lot of debt. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=384.72s)]
*  And if those tariffs are going to help bring back more to our economy, I'm all for it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=387.08s)]
*  ANNA, in some cases, you heard some of his supporters essentially repeating the analogy [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=393.84s)]
*  that he uses sometimes when he talks about a sick patient and that you might have some [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=398.48s)]
*  tough moments in the beginning, but this is ultimately going to lead to a country that [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=403.2s)]
*  is stronger and healthier. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  It's clear that his base is sticking with him, even as when you look at polling among [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=410.04s)]
*  the general population, this is an issue that shows to be pretty risky for his presidency. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=413.84s)]
*  Jack Brewster, I always appreciate your reporting there. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=420.4s)]
*  Thank you, John. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=422.96s)]
*  You write about this really seismic unilateral approach in terms of the actions President [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=423.96s)]
*  Trump has taken so far. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=431.23999999999995s)]
*  You write, in times of war and economic crisis, past presidents from Lincoln to Roosevelt [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=432.64s)]
*  have tested the constitutional limits of their office. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=437.71999999999997s)]
*  None have tried to exercise so much power across such a broad range of issues and with [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=440.59999999999997s)]
*  such disregard for Congress and the courts as Trump has in a time of relative peace [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=445.44s)]
*  and economic stability. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=451.32s)]
*  John, it strikes me that this is a Republican president who has a GOP majority in both chambers [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=452.92s)]
*  of Congress, yet he has signed fewer bills into law than his predecessors, going back [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=460.52s)]
*  to Eisenhower. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=465.36s)]
*  Is that by design? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=466.36s)]
*  I think it largely is, Anna. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=467.36s)]
*  The president had the ability, if you wanted to, to come in and work with Congress and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=471.28s)]
*  do some major things, and he's absolutely ignored Congress. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=474.44s)]
*  His aides say, I talked to Caroline Levitt, the White House press secretary, last week, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=477.84s)]
*  that he will be focused on getting a deal on the budget reconciliation bill. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=482.36s)]
*  Of course, the White House uses the term deal all the time, even when there's—even [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=486.2s)]
*  when they're only negotiating with their own side, which is basically what's happening [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=490.8s)]
*  here. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=494.04s)]
*  But she says that they'll be focused on that in the next hundred days. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=495.04s)]
*  I think Trump wanted to hit the ground running. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=500.24s)]
*  I think he promised to hit the ground running. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=502.76000000000005s)]
*  And this has been breathtaking, whether you are a fan of his or a critic of his, whether [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  you see what he's doing as necessary, regardless of the law, if you see it as both unnecessary [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=509.36s)]
*  and potentially breaking some of the laws. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=516.32s)]
*  We've seen courts push back on him. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=519.16s)]
*  Whether—however you see it, this is breathtaking. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=520.76s)]
*  We haven't seen anything like this in terms of the size and scope of change in such a [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=524.46s)]
*  short period of time. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=529.08s)]
*  Yeah, no doubt. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=530.08s)]
*  And, Christine, we heard there with Shaq that there are Trump supporters who say they'll [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=531.5600000000001s)]
*  be patient. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=534.84s)]
*  Sure. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=535.84s)]
*  They're really buying the line. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=536.84s)]
*  Just wait, you know, give me time to let these policies take effect while we have some new [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=537.84s)]
*  reporting, new warnings about when these tariffs will be felt and how severe an impact. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=542.44s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=550.48s)]
*  If consumers have to pay more for a set of sheets, that is not the end of the world, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=551.48s)]
*  right? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=554.48s)]
*  I mean, the consumers are so used to very, very cheap goods. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=555.48s)]
*  That's not what the issue here is. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=558.12s)]
*  The issue is the way that trade has been just thrown off a cliff. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=559.48s)]
*  You're going to have longshoremen. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=565.4s)]
*  You're going to have truckers. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=566.88s)]
*  You're going to have—the people who handle all these goods will be seeing layoffs. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=567.88s)]
*  We've seen from the big West Coast longshoremen and warehouse union, they say that this is [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  a war on the working people and that the first Trump tariffs didn't result in companies [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=576.64s)]
*  moving wholesale their operations back to the U.S. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=582.48s)]
*  bigger burden on the people who pay for it, the people who work in these industries. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=586.08s)]
*  So a big concern from this big union that this is going to be a problem. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=590.72s)]
*  And we've been checking sort of our channels with freight and logistics, and already you're [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=594.64s)]
*  seeing trucker layoffs, our sources are telling us. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=598.24s)]
*  So these are working people who may have voted for Donald Trump, who instead of just the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=600.58s)]
*  pain of maybe paying more for your everyday goods, we're talking about a reordering of [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=605.32s)]
*  working class, working class parts of the American economy. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=610.24s)]
*  And if you have a recession, so many economists tell me the first jobs to go in a recession [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=613.72s)]
*  are manufacturing jobs. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=618.0400000000001s)]
*  So in a policy that's meant to restore manufacturing, the first fallout will be in manufacturing [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=619.38s)]
*  if you don't pull this off exactly right. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s30MqvTUK_A&t=626.36s)]
