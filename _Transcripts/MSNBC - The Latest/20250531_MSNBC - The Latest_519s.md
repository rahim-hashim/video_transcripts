# ‘No question’ Democrats will seek to bring Musk in to testify on DOGE: Rep. Wasserman Schultz
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo)
*  I think that, unfortunately, we're going to have to wait until the Democrats are in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=0.0s)]
*  majority, which will hopefully be in the midterms. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=4.8s)]
*  And then we can absolutely bring Elon Musk in, and we can have him under oath, and we [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  can have him tell us about everything that he did. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=12.66s)]
*  New reaction today to the departure of Elon Musk from the White House as a special government [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=17.56s)]
*  employee. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=22.0s)]
*  And joining me now, we have our friend, Florida congressman and former DNC chair Debbie Wasserman [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=23.0s)]
*  Schultz. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=26.92s)]
*  She is on the committee on appropriations. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=27.92s)]
*  Congresswoman, welcome back to the show. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=30.64s)]
*  So Musk said he's disappointed in the massive spending in the Republicans' big, beautiful [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=32.24s)]
*  bill because it undermines Dozier's work, even though Musk missed his target of slashing [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=37.88s)]
*  federal spending by two trillion bucks and cut only about 150 billion. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=43.36s)]
*  Experts believe the real number is potentially even lower. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=47.84s)]
*  Musk said yesterday he hopes to continue as a friend and advisor to the president. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=51.56s)]
*  What concerns you about his call for Dozier's mission to become a, quote, way of life throughout [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=56.88s)]
*  the government? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=62.88s)]
*  I mean, if Democrats take over the House in the midterms, should bringing in Musk to testify [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=63.88s)]
*  be a priority? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  Oh, well, first of all, thanks for having me, Alex, once again. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  And there's no question that when Democrats take over the House of Representatives and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=74.0s)]
*  are in the majority, and Hakeem Jeffries is the speaker of the House of Representatives, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=78.84s)]
*  that we'll need to engage in in terms of oversight over the lawless Trump administration will [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=84.32s)]
*  be to bring in Elon Musk to testify about his illegal, unlawful rummaging around in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  people's private personal tax information and invading the Social Security data illegally [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=96.24s)]
*  and his invasion of private personal data in IRS records. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=103.52s)]
*  But what he did this week, Alex, is he set the quiet part out loud about the Republicans' [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=110.28s)]
*  big ugly bill, where it blows a massive multi-trillion-dollar hole in the deficit, at the same time cutting [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=114.6s)]
*  hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars, yanking health care away from almost 14 million [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=122.76s)]
*  people, making the largest cuts in nutrition assistance in American history, devastating [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=128.28s)]
*  of billions of dollars in cuts to health care and cancer research, which is, I'll tell you, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=136.28s)]
*  as a breast cancer survivor who was able to benefit from the results of research that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=142.76s)]
*  showed I was much more at risk, I carry a genetic mutation that made me much higher [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=148.12s)]
*  risk of getting cancer and getting it again in the future, without that, I probably would [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=152.84s)]
*  not be sitting here talking to you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=158.04s)]
*  The mega-extremists, they don't care. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=160.44s)]
*  They are much more focused on transferring that wealth to millionaires and billionaires [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=163.16000000000003s)]
*  and wealthy corporations. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=168.52s)]
*  On Thursday, you made an unannounced visit to an immigrant detention facility in Miami-Dade [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=171.4s)]
*  County, the Crohm Center Detention Center. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=175.88000000000002s)]
*  It made some recent headlines after an investigation found two inmates died due to questionable [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=179.0s)]
*  medical care after authorities had said it was from natural causes. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=183.96s)]
*  What were the conditions you saw and what your visit revealed about the administration's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=188.92s)]
*  immigration policy? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=192.83999999999997s)]
*  Alex, I made an unannounced visit as a result of changing the law in an amendment that I [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=195.56s)]
*  passed through the Appropriations Bill in 2020 that has carried through local administrations [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=202.2s)]
*  that allows members to make unannounced visits. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  They did, thankfully, let me in to make that inspection. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=209.72s)]
*  I was there for about three and a half hours, saw just about every aspect of the Crohm Detention [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=212.11999999999998s)]
*  Center. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=217.96s)]
*  It's the oldest detention center in the country and it shows. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  I'll tell you, as these detainees are being brought in, they are in a massive pile of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=223.88s)]
*  people crammed in small rooms, forced to eat, sleep, and defecate and urinate in that room, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=229.72s)]
*  in a toilet in the corner. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=237.8s)]
*  It is a pile of humanity in multiple rooms. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  You have a facility built for 882 people that has 1111 there right now. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=243.88s)]
*  Two people died earlier. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=250.04s)]
*  I asked questions about the details that caused those deaths and, of course, I really got [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=251.24s)]
*  vague answers. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=257.0s)]
*  One of the deaths was a Ukrainian man who had a stroke and the reports from workers in the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=258.92s)]
*  facility said that they didn't call 911 for 41 minutes. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=265.32s)]
*  If you know anything about stroke, time is of the essence. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  The conditions in there, Alex, are nothing that you would want anyone you cared about [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=273.08s)]
*  to be subjected to. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=278.52s)]
*  More deeply concerning, Donald Trump is obviously not doing anything like what he said. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=279.88s)]
*  60% are criminals in that detention, but a lot of them are low-level crimes. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  40% are people who were yanked off the streets, who committed no crime at all, because all [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump is doing is trying to bleach out the United States and deport as many people [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=296.36s)]
*  as he can, particularly in spite of them being from countries like Haiti, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=301.48s)]
*  Nicaragua, Venezuela and Cuba, brutal dictatorships that they couldn't possibly [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  avoid being harmed if they were taken back to their country of origin. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=313.88s)]
*  This week, as you know, Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=319.16s)]
*  opened an investigation into the private dinner the president held for the 220 top [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=323.24s)]
*  holders of the Trump meme coin. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=327.32s)]
*  Ethics experts call Trump's crypto ventures the starkest example to date of Trump seeking [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=329.72s)]
*  to profit off the presidency. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=334.68s)]
*  Do you support these investigations, even though congressional Democrats lack the authority to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=337.16s)]
*  hold the president accountable in any meaningful way at this point? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=341.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, what do you expect the findings might reveal to Americans? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=345.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  I served for several years on both the Judiciary and the Oversight Committee. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=351.88000000000005s)]
*  Jamie Raskin has the expertise as the ranking member and the staff and members to support [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=356.12s)]
*  conducting the absolutely critical investigations that are necessary even while we're in the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=361.72s)]
*  minority. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=366.2s)]
*  Not only is he selling pardons, I mean, one of the attendees at his meme coin dinner gave [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=367.32s)]
*  it was a million dollar table, and then all of a sudden, you know, her son is granted a pardon. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=375.8s)]
*  He took a jumbo, he's in the process of taking a luxury jumbo jet, total violation of the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=382.76000000000005s)]
*  Constitution from Qatar, a state sponsor of terror, and wheeling and dealing on hotel deals has [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  never divested any of his assets and is profiting off the presidency. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=396.6s)]
*  So no question, we can't afford one minute to avoid shining a white hot spotlight on the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=401.24s)]
*  on the unethical profiteering that Donald Trump is using the White House and not that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=408.76000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump is using the White House to benefit from. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=416.12s)]
*  Let me ask you quickly, because now you held a briefing with FEMA. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=418.76000000000005s)]
*  Tomorrow starts the hurricane season. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=421.56s)]
*  What are your concerns about what may lie ahead and its ability to handle it? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  FEMA hasn't released. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=429.0s)]
*  In fact, they pulled back and still haven't released their strategic plan for this hurricane [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=430.04s)]
*  season, which is slated to be above average, according to NOAA. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  I do an annual hurricane briefing every year. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=438.35999999999996s)]
*  And you know, what the concerns that were expressed, it's a request I asked, were that, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=441.15999999999997s)]
*  look, if you go through the kinds of cuts that the Trump administration is planning, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=446.59999999999997s)]
*  they're even talking about completely shutting down FEMA and not doing the kind of reimbursement [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=452.84s)]
*  and recovery assistance that states like mine in Hurricane Alley desperately need. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=459.15999999999997s)]
*  If you're taking away the millions of dollars that have been able to advance [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=463.72s)]
*  these technology and the expertise necessary to make people more aware of storms coming towards [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=467.96000000000004s)]
*  them and more accurate predictions of who's in which in their path, the NOAA experts were very [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=474.92s)]
*  clear that it would be less likely they would not be able to make the kind of progress we've made as [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=481.88000000000005s)]
*  a result of those investments and people would be less clear and less certain about what danger [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=487.40000000000003s)]
*  approached them. Okay, that is a sobering thought. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=492.44s)]
*  Congressman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, good to see you. See you again. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq4wSAk3eRo&t=495.4s)]
