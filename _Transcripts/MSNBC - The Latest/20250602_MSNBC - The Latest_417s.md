# ‘Living in a new Gilded Age’: Why the rich keep getting richer in the U.S.
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4)
*  The uber rich are only getting richer the Wall Street Journal's analysis [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=0.0s)]
*  They do it every year shows that America's CEO salaries have set yet another record at the top of the list the head of Exxon [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=4.32s)]
*  Enterprise a company that makes tasers stun guns. He was paid. Are you ready? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=12.96s)]
*  165 million dollars last year [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=19.12s)]
*  But a new CNN poll finds that Americans on the whole are far less [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=21.48s)]
*  Optimistic about their own ability to get ahead only [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=26.0s)]
*  54% now believe that the American dream is achievable through hard work [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=30.68s)]
*  The lowest that number has been in CNN polling since at least the 90s [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=34.64s)]
*  Joining me here is Evan Osnos staff writer at the New Yorker and author of the haves and have yachts [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=39.92s)]
*  Dispatches on the ultra rich this Evan is a very clever book title. I have to say that you actually traveled to Via Reggio [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=46.4s)]
*  It's a little town in in the tusk in Tuscany. They build what a fifth of the world's super yachts [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=54.56s)]
*  house business and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  Is it that we're now in a Vanderbilt and Rockefeller era? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=63.56s)]
*  Business is booming in the super yacht world. I mean, I think it's easy for a lot of regular folks not to know it [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=68.36s)]
*  You know, we don't come in contact with it all that much [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=73.72s)]
*  But there has really never been a better time over the last few years to be building these giant boats. Let's remind ourselves [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=76.04s)]
*  Pleasure boats that are the length of a football field in some cases they cost more than half a billion dollars [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=82.8s)]
*  These are the most expensive [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=88.92s)]
*  Yeah, literally. I mean nobody we've never actually built things that are more expensive than that more than works of art more than houses [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=91.4s)]
*  Look, yeah in some ways we're actually we're now living in a new Gilded Age Chris [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=98.56s)]
*  This is even more than the Gilded Age and I'm not making an abstract point today [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  America's wealthiest people have a larger share of the nation's overall wealth than the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  Vanderbilts and the Carnegie's did at the heyday of their power a century ago [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, the consolidation of wealth has also led to the consolidation of political power, right? Give us a sense of how much power [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=116.84s)]
*  Billionaires have right now and have been able to consolidate and how much of that is related to having a billionaire in the White House [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's been an amazing thing to watch [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=131.64s)]
*  You know, we sort of know this in the abstract around us, but the numbers are astonishing in 2004 [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=133.76s)]
*  Billionaires contributed a total of 13 million dollars to the presidential race at the time [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=139.39999999999998s)]
*  It seemed like a lot in the 2024 election 20 years later. They contributed 200 times as much [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  That was the top hundred or so families in this country [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=150.76s)]
*  So we have gone through the roof part of that was the Citizens United decision [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  But it's also the fact that there is simply so much more money out there [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=158.0s)]
*  You know between Donald Trump's first inauguration and his second inauguration there was tax cuts along the way [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=161.96s)]
*  The net worth of America's billionaires more than doubled and he has surrounded himself [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=167.8s)]
*  He has celebrated that culture you see it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=172.16s)]
*  He named 13 billionaires to the top ranks of his administration and in many ways [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=174.4s)]
*  He is practicing a kind of I guess you'd call it an open marriage between politics and profit [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=178.36s)]
*  When you start looking at that and you start looking at the number of billionaires [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  for example in this administration many of whom gave a lot of money to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=186.28s)]
*  Donald Trump's campaign to his inauguration [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  Joining the club that he's starting in Washington DC or his son is starting in Washington DC [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  It's the amount of money sounds incredible for example to join a club [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=200.8s)]
*  but for them it's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=205.88s)]
*  They can't spend as fast as they're making money would that be fair to say yeah [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  Look Warren Buffett has talked about this fact in his life. He's somebody who gives a lot of money away [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=213.76s)]
*  He has described his own fortune as an almost incomprehensible sum [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=218.60000000000002s)]
*  He's given away 60 billion dollars, but by the fact that he has so much of it it continues to grow by a kind of arithmetic [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=223.08s)]
*  Momentum he's just a successful investor and when you have that much as he will be the first to tell you it compounds [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=229.44s)]
*  He still has 160 billion left. Look. I think that this is also a presidency [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=234.58s)]
*  Which has decided to be quite open about the way that money affects policy even you know [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=239.16000000000003s)]
*  We talked a moment ago about the Gilded Age and the Vanderbilts in the carnegays [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=246.2s)]
*  None of them had an office like Elon Musk in the White House complex none of them were given a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=249.32s)]
*  Government department with which they could fire tens of thousands of workers [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean this is a level of control for the world's richest man in our politics that we've never seen and I think that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=259.2s)]
*  In many ways Musk's exit from politics under tremendous public pressure is a sign that it tripped a wire in our collective [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=265.88s)]
*  American national sense of what's okay? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=273.44s)]
*  I think people just said this doesn't feel right to us does it look like that this divide is going to have a political [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=276.28s)]
*  Impact and we know for example during the Gilded Age the result of that was a progressive era, right? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=282.2s)]
*  Or are these numbers just so big people can't even wrap their heads around them [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  I think we are at a fork in the road [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=292.52s)]
*  You know I think we are at a point now where if we do business as usual [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=294.35999999999996s)]
*  If we look around and turn our heads back in 30 40 years [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=298.56s)]
*  We're going to say how is it that a tiny group of Americans ended up with such a large portion of our national assets? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=301.9s)]
*  But there is another path we've been down this road the good news and we know the history [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=308.73999999999995s)]
*  We know how to do this it took Teddy Roosevelt and ultimately Franklin Roosevelt to say look if we want to protect American democracy [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=312.7s)]
*  We want to protect capitalism [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=318.62s)]
*  That means figuring out a way to make sure that the gains the winnings are distributed a little bit more fairly when we talk about [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=320.5s)]
*  Someone who is working day in and day out to try to feed their family and the person at the top making literally [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  thousands of times more money [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=336.82s)]
*  Someone who makes more in a week or a month than some people will make in their entire lives [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=339.02s)]
*  Is that what ultimately fuels it it really does I? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=344.9s)]
*  Remember a conversation reporting in West Virginia when I was talking to a coal miner a few years ago [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=349.22s)]
*  And he said to me he'd heard that his CEO of his company was making [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=354.58s)]
*  400 or 500 times what a frontline coal worker coal miner was making and he said honestly [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=359.58s)]
*  Do you know anybody any man who is worth really worth four or five hundred times another man? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=364.98s)]
*  I think there is a way in which this idea is just viscerally [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  It it offends people and we've been down this road in our history [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=373.86s)]
*  We've had moments when the gap and inequality has grown and moments when it's shrunk at the high point of the 20th century our [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=377.2s)]
*  Inequality was actually narrow and there are steps we can take it's not hard [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=383.02s)]
*  It's about taxes and wages and we can get there and it's outlined in the halves and have yachts [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=387.14s)]
*  Dispatches on the ultra rich Evan Osnos. Thank you my pleasure good talking to you [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=391.65999999999997s)]
*  You [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkIMlSPqX4&t=412.78s)]
