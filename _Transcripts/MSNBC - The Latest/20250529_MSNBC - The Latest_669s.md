# Officially OUT! Musk exits WH, losing on spending, with lessons for fighting 47
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA)
*  Elon Musk donated a lot of money. He claimed he would cut a lot of money. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=0.0s)]
*  And now, pretty quickly, his time as a big cabinet-advising special government employee is over. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=4.0s)]
*  Musk has made an official departure, posting about it online, thanking Trump, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=10.8s)]
*  referencing something we have long been tracking, which is how, even with all the loopholes and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=16.64s)]
*  boundary testing, he had a 130-day limit in government. At Politico, they say Musk came [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=21.04s)]
*  in with a chainsaw and went out with a tweet, a nonpartisan publication knocking him. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=27.28s)]
*  From the beginning, Musk sowed much confusion in his efforts to impact the Trump agenda, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=32.56s)]
*  and his so-called efficiency group was not efficient even in the way it made cuts. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  It has been quite a trip. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=47.28s)]
*  I think this is going to be the most transformative presidency, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=50.96s)]
*  perhaps since the founding of the country. It's going to be a revolution. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=61.12s)]
*  I think we can do at least $2 trillion. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=64.48s)]
*  We can actually find a trillion dollars in savings. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=67.52s)]
*  We anticipate savings in FY26 from reduction of waste and fraud by $150 billion. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=70.88s)]
*  What do you think of my hat? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=76.24s)]
*  I haven't asked the president for anything ever. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=78.24s)]
*  And if it comes up, how will you handle it? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=80.96s)]
*  You won't be involved. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'll recuse myself. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=85.28s)]
*  I love Tesla. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=87.12s)]
*  Many false claims there. He did not recuse. They tried to hawk Tesla's at the White House, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=91.12s)]
*  even as the car company, for a range of reasons, saw its stock crash during the same 100-plus days [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  while Musk was doing double duty. He said he would save trillions. Musk's agency, though, was caught [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=102.64s)]
*  misleading the public. He eventually had to downgrade the goals. Musk is from tech. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=108.56s)]
*  There's a big motto about disruption. And while that might work in a business setting to some [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=115.12s)]
*  degree, especially if you don't care about firing people or well-being, something the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  government's supposed to care about, but it didn't work very well here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  Regulations basically should be default gone. Default gone. Not default there. Default gone. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  And if it turns out that we missed a mark on a regulation, we always add it back in. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=134.96s)]
*  Missing a mark on a regulation doesn't work well if you get a financial crisis or [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=142.8s)]
*  deadly emergencies. And the problem for Musk was that the type of cutting he was doing of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=148.56s)]
*  government programs didn't work. I can show you some examples right here. We'll put this up on [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  the screen. He was, of course, blocked in court, like other Trump efforts, exceeding authority. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=159.28s)]
*  When people learned over time what he was up to, it was very unpopular. And then Musk, who, of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  course, is unelected, found that Republican lawmakers and people working alongside the MAGA [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  agenda were now facing pretty strong protests, partly because of the way he was leading. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=176.96s)]
*  Here's the hit that Tesla took. Musk's unpopular politics were part of toxifying that brand. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=184.24s)]
*  SpaceX continued to have its own problems. And while that's part of running a business, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  there were real questions of multiple companies over whether his sort of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  part-time government job was distracting him. Most CEOs couldn't get away with that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=201.28s)]
*  if other companies in the first place. There's the self-dealing we've told you about, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=204.72s)]
*  efforts to leverage power to make money. And yet this is a key irony. If this were a movie, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=209.12s)]
*  it might be unbelievable. Despite having the inside track and all the power and overseeing [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=215.68s)]
*  the cabinet meetings, this has been a period where Musk has lost more money than usual, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=220.56s)]
*  his net worth down by a staggering $50-plus billion since the inauguration alone. He has [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=224.96s)]
*  complained about what he has faced. Some accountability, some criticism. He's upset [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=231.04s)]
*  that in politics, people will respond to what you do. There's also the issue of scientific [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=238.72s)]
*  advancements and how NASA will work or education will work or rural support networks will work [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=243.6s)]
*  when you cut this fast, this indiscriminately. And in response to what is here a provable record, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=250.08s)]
*  what some call a failed record, Musk says he's some kind of victim. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=257.36s)]
*  You've talked about $4 billion a day being saved. If you add that up, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=264.0s)]
*  it's not going to get to $2 trillion over the lifetime of Doge. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=268.48s)]
*  I'm sorry. I feel you're somewhat trapped in the NPC dialogue tree of a traditional [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=271.68s)]
*  journalist. We do not make the laws, nor do we control the judiciary, nor do we control the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=281.28s)]
*  executive branch. Doge is an advisory group. We are doing the best we can as an advisory group. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=288.88s)]
*  His best that he can is a matter of, I guess, debate or opinion. But the other claims there [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=296.32s)]
*  were false. Fact check, false. They do write the laws. They control the Republican House and Senate, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=306.24s)]
*  which has proved very pliant for President Trump. If they wanted to do the harder, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=314.48s)]
*  longer work of writing laws to change funding in the future, they could have done that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=318.0s)]
*  Might take more than the 130 days he was allotted, but again, we're getting into the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=322.0s)]
*  competence zone and whether they really wanted to do the hard, longer work. Meanwhile, millions of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=325.92s)]
*  Americans are facing setbacks from some of the cuts they did rush. Worried about the power that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=331.36s)]
*  Elon Musk has been given without any kind of election. My concern right now, and I think [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=337.04s)]
*  that speaks for a lot of Americans, is Elon Musk. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=342.88s)]
*  Elon Musk pushed. The people pushed back and now he's out. That brings us to a special day [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  around here on The Beat. It is time for J-Day. You know the man. You see the cartoon. You see the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=357.36s)]
*  embattled flags of some of our nation's universities that you've attended. Welcome back, J. Col. Maduri. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=366.08s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Ari. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  Having you on J-Day is fitting, I think. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=375.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, considering it's named after me, you know, what other J could there possibly be [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=378.88s)]
*  that you could have on J-Day? I mean, I happen to know that sometimes people call you Chai. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=384.64s)]
*  If it were a lighter news day, maybe we could just have a Chai latte there that, you know, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  but it's not the same, Chai. Thanks for being here. I meant what I said in our setup. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=394.72s)]
*  It's quite remarkable that Musk is out this quickly. He has been bemoaning [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  his setbacks or failures in public, which means he's not spinning them as winds. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=408.24s)]
*  I mean, you have a theory about this, so go ahead. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, money can't buy you love, as The Beatle said. Money also can't buy you the respect [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  of voters. It can't buy you the respect of MAGA, and it appears at this point not to be able to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=421.6s)]
*  buy you the respect of Donald Trump. I mean, it's very interesting that this has all happened [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=427.68s)]
*  over the course of three months. Over those months, we have seen Musk lose billions, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  and we have seen Donald Trump gain billions. So his utility has declined for Donald Trump. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=440.0s)]
*  Donald Trump now feels probably he doesn't need Musk's money anymore. And Musk believed he was [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=445.92s)]
*  invincible. You know, it's turned out he was disposable. And his usefulness to Trump is now [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=452.0s)]
*  is no longer the case, and he has been shown the door. You know, sometimes we talk about this, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=458.88s)]
*  and in my notes here, I know that one other point you raised was that you're arguing today [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=466.88s)]
*  that Musk basically served his purpose, and whatever claims they were about helping the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=472.32s)]
*  budget or the government, he's a smart guy who thought he could excel in this universe. But you [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=477.76s)]
*  argue that Trump used him, benefited from the Twitter purchase during the campaign, benefited [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=482.96s)]
*  by being heat shield the last few months, and Musk ends up the loser in the equation. Explain. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=491.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, to paraphrase Donald Trump, Musk thought it was going to be so easy, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=496.8s)]
*  that he was the world's richest man. He had gone from success to success. Obviously, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=503.68s)]
*  he'd be able to do this. He'd be able to take over the government. He'd be able to do what he wanted, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=509.44s)]
*  and it would just be so easy. After all, he was a real billionaire, and Donald Trump merely played [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=514.24s)]
*  one on television. The problem for Musk is that Trump's skill set has proven more useful than [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=520.24s)]
*  Musk's skill set. Trump is a very good TV talker. Musk is not. Musk has absolutely no charisma. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=526.7199999999999s)]
*  And one other thing was that Democrats went early and pounced on Musk. You saw it with the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=533.76s)]
*  Fighting Oligarchy Tour that AOC and Bernie did. It's very similar to what Jonathan Chey talked [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=540.24s)]
*  about with Biff Tanner, where you punch the bully in the mouth, and the bully collapses and falls. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=545.52s)]
*  That's exactly what happened this time. Yeah, and I'm curious how that connects to the pushback, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=551.28s)]
*  because on the one hand, there's skepticism of the what we might call traditional Democratic or [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=558.88s)]
*  liberal frame of get out there and fight and get organized, and it matters. We talked to a lot of [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=564.96s)]
*  people around here, and there are people who feel disillusioned with that for reasons I think [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=571.52s)]
*  everyone knows. And yet, some of what looked organic, we heard from someone who organized [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=575.1999999999999s)]
*  a Tesla protest, and they said they put it up online. They'd never done a protest before. They [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=582.0s)]
*  went in Michigan, which is the swing state that went Trump. And then they found, they said to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=586.4s)]
*  their shock, over 100 people there. And then that pattern repeated. And so the direct action on this [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=591.28s)]
*  specific thing, did it work? Yeah, I think it worked very well. There's a famous Woody Allen [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=595.68s)]
*  line, 80% of life is just showing up. The people who protested Musk showed up, and that actually [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=602.9599999999999s)]
*  really ended up making a difference. It really helped shape the narrative about Elon Musk. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=609.92s)]
*  I know we compared him to Tony Stark before I compared him to Lex Luthor. We should remember, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=615.5999999999999s)]
*  in Superman comics, Lex Luthor always loses. What Musk is now is much closer to Thurston Howell, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=621.84s)]
*  the third, the millionaire on Gilligan's Island, where he's got all that money, and it's of [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=628.5600000000001s)]
*  absolutely no use to him. Everything that he has, everything he's earned, none of it seems to matter [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=633.2s)]
*  in this arena that he thought he would conquer so easily. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=639.44s)]
*  you [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyV6sjLlPMA&t=651.84s)]
