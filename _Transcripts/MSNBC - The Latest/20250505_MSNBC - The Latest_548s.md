# Massive 'No Kings' protest expected to rain on Donald Trump's (military) parade
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw)
*  Since the first year of his first term in office, he has wanted a parade. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=0.0s)]
*  And not just a normal parade, he wants a military parade. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=5.32s)]
*  After Trump in his first term saw a military parade in France for Bastille Day, he said [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=9.38s)]
*  he wanted to top that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=14.0s)]
*  He said he wanted something bigger than that, something more like the gigantic Death Star [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  military parades held by countries like China and Russia and North Korea. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=20.78s)]
*  Specifically, Trump wanted tanks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  He wanted tanks upon tanks rolling down the boulevards of Washington, D.C. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=29.28s)]
*  The issue with tanks, though, is that they weigh a ton. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=34.28s)]
*  To be more exact, American tanks weigh like 30 to 70 tons, more or less, depending on [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=37.84s)]
*  the model, which is way too heavy to roll down the streets of Washington, D.C. without [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=43.0s)]
*  destroying the streets of Washington, D.C. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=48.92s)]
*  So in his first term, Donald Trump did not get his military parade with tanks. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  But he did get a consolation prize. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=57.46s)]
*  Halfway through his first term, on the 4th of July in 2019, he held what he called a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  salute to America in front of the Lincoln Memorial. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=64.38s)]
*  Basically, he gave a speech, a stationary speech, and he did have tanks, but they were [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=68.38s)]
*  not tanks rolling by. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=73.26s)]
*  They were also stationary tanks. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=74.84s)]
*  In fact, the closest thing to a parade that day was the convoy that was required to get [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=77.62s)]
*  into position because the tanks had to be carried toward the memorial on semi trucks [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=83.28s)]
*  and then carefully rolled off the trucks onto a series of strategically placed wooden planks [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=88.76s)]
*  where they put them on little platforms so they wouldn't break anything. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=95.28s)]
*  That was it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=99.56s)]
*  Tanks on semi trucks and then on little plinths. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=100.72s)]
*  That was it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=104.64s)]
*  His whole first term, Trump never got the big military parade he wanted. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=105.64s)]
*  Now, of course, he's trying again. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=111.55999999999999s)]
*  The Army now says it is planning a military parade complete with more than 6,000 soldiers [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=113.36s)]
*  and, you guessed it, tanks. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=119.36s)]
*  It is still unclear if those tanks will be rolling or stationary or on the back of semi [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=122.64s)]
*  trucks maybe, but the whole spectacle is set for the 250th anniversary of the founding [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  of the U.S. Army, which also happens to be the president's own birthday, June 14th. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=131.82s)]
*  And if that news makes you want to be somewhere anywhere else, take heart. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=137.24s)]
*  Something else is happening that day. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=143.12s)]
*  At more than 100 locations around the country thus far, I have a feeling there's going [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=145.16s)]
*  to be more than that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=149.12s)]
*  A coalition of groups including Indivisible and Social Security Works and 5051, they are [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=151.32000000000002s)]
*  all organizing a nationwide day of protest for June 14th. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  They're calling it No King's Day. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=162.72s)]
*  As they put it on their website, quote, Donald Trump wants tanks in the street and a made-for-TV [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=165.4s)]
*  display of dominance for his birthday, a spectacle meant to look like strength. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=170.28s)]
*  But real power isn't staged in Washington. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  It rises up everywhere else. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=179.32s)]
*  Joining us now is Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of Indivisible. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  Ezra, it's nice to see you this evening. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=185.0s)]
*  Thanks very much for making time. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=187.28s)]
*  Great to see you, Rachel. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=189.0s)]
*  So we've spent a lot of time covering sort of the character and the effect of protests [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  of all kinds around the country. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=196.28s)]
*  A lot of those organized through Indivisible, a lot of them organized through 5051 and other [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=197.76s)]
*  groups. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=202.6s)]
*  What is the basic idea, the specific idea, I guess, around June 14th? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=203.6s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump wants to spend tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to throw himself [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=209.0s)]
*  a big fancy parade with tanks in the streets. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=214.64s)]
*  On one level, this is ridiculous, right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=219.16s)]
*  But he is doing this for a reason. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  This is straight out of the authoritarian playbook. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=224.12s)]
*  He wants to project strength. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  He wants everybody to think that he is all-powerful, that he rules the world. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=229.0s)]
*  He doesn't. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  He doesn't. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=235.42000000000002s)]
*  As we said on that website, look, real power is not in D.C. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  It's distributed all across the country. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=240.88s)]
*  And what we're looking to do on No King's Day is to say, look, Donald Trump does not [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=244.48s)]
*  own the flag. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  He does not own patriotism. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  In fact, we can all show up in opposition to a king in this country. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=252.72s)]
*  And this isn't about any individual organization. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  This is about all of us, whether you are from the faith community, whether you're a veteran, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=262.44s)]
*  whether you're an activist, whether you're a teacher, you can be part of this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=266.84s)]
*  As you mentioned, there are a hundred events so far. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=272.0s)]
*  This has been up for the weekend, available to register events. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=274.2s)]
*  I would expect over a thousand. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=277.32s)]
*  We saw 1,100 for May Day protests. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=278.96s)]
*  We saw over 1,300 events all across the world for April 5th, hands off. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=281.0s)]
*  If you are watching this right now and you are thinking, well, I don't want a king in [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=286.2s)]
*  this country, good news, neither do we. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=289.76s)]
*  And you can be part of this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=292.64s)]
*  Look up. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=294.46s)]
*  See if you've got an event near you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=295.46s)]
*  If you don't, congratulations. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=296.46s)]
*  You are going to be the organizer for an event in your community. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=298.53999999999996s)]
*  We need them in rural communities. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=301.52s)]
*  We need them in urban communities. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=303.4s)]
*  We need them in red states and purple states and blue states. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=304.4s)]
*  Ultimately, this comes down to all of us. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=307.04s)]
*  We have got to do the work to show that, yes, this is a constitutional republic and a constitutional [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=309.56s)]
*  republic has no kings. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=314.8s)]
*  As we're over the course of the first 100 days of Trump in office, I feel like what [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=317.08s)]
*  I saw as the effect of protests were sort of two things. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=322.2s)]
*  First of all, because the protests weren't just one big protest one day in Washington [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=328.14s)]
*  or one big day in New York or something like that, but because the protests were constant [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  and happening so frequently and happening in literally every state in the country and, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  I'd say, over time in almost every town of any size and some towns of no size. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=341.76s)]
*  Because they happen in so many places, one of the effects was that a lot of Republican [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=347.36s)]
*  members of Congress and senators found themselves confronted by their own constituents about [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=352.2s)]
*  stuff that Trump was doing that they themselves as elected Republicans couldn't defend and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=356.96s)]
*  couldn't explain and felt like they had to ultimately say, OK, I side with my constituents [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  on this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=368.32s)]
*  And that drove a lot of caving in Washington in terms of what Trump was trying to do. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=369.32s)]
*  But then the other thing that I saw happen is that I think that large numbers of protests [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=373.32s)]
*  over time happening all over the place created a sort of culture in which it was shameful [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=378.72s)]
*  to capitulate. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=385.24s)]
*  And the groups, whether they're law firms or billionaires or business interests or anybody [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=387.88s)]
*  else or Republican electeds or anybody else or even Democratic electeds who were thinking [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=393.6s)]
*  about sort of cozying up to Trump, looked at this footage and looked at what was going [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=397.6s)]
*  on in these communities and looked at these large protests and felt like, you know what, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=402.2s)]
*  what those people are asking for is probably the right side of history. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=405.68s)]
*  And I don't feel comfortable staying on the other side of that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=409.76s)]
*  I felt like it created a cultural dynamic in which it was embarrassing to be siding [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=411.76s)]
*  with Trump. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=417.36s)]
*  That's what I've been seeing. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=418.8s)]
*  Just covering this stuff in order to tell people about the news over these past hundred [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=420.28s)]
*  days. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=423.96s)]
*  I wanted to ask for your reaction to those observations and ask as somebody who's been [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=424.96s)]
*  involved really right in the middle of this, if you feel like the impact has been something [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=428.32s)]
*  other than that. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=432.0s)]
*  Look, you are exactly right. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=433.0s)]
*  What we are doing with mass protests, mass peaceful protests in communities, red, blue [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=435.48s)]
*  and purple around the country is not is not just showing up for the sake of showing up. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=441.04s)]
*  We're showing up to send a message to everybody else who is looking to their left and looking [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=445.32s)]
*  to the right and trying to decide what do I do. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=449.48s)]
*  And as you said, this is law firms. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=451.88s)]
*  This is universities. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=453.8s)]
*  This is businesses. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=454.94s)]
*  People are trying to understand. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=456.88s)]
*  Is this guy for real? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=458.0s)]
*  Is he in power forever? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=459.24s)]
*  Do I have to adjust to this new reality permanently or will there be a new day, a new day of accountability [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=460.78000000000003s)]
*  that follows the Trump administration? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=467.64s)]
*  By showing up in mass repeatedly month after month, week after week, day after day in many [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=470.32s)]
*  cases, what we are doing is sending a very strong signal to those businesses, those universities, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=476.68s)]
*  those law firms that, oh, I can't actually just cover myself today or next week because [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=482.68s)]
*  this guy is going to be out soon. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=488.48s)]
*  He's an unpopular lame duck president and there is going to be a future post Trump era. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=490.24s)]
*  And I'm still going to be a law firm. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=495.72s)]
*  I'm still going to be a business. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=497.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm still going to be a university. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=498.8s)]
*  I'm going to have to contend with my actions today. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=500.28s)]
*  So the smart move stops being I'm going to cover myself today and it becomes I've got [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=503.52s)]
*  to think about what comes next. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=508.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=510.8s)]
*  We all should be thinking about that all the time in terms of it, you know, explaining [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=511.8s)]
*  ourselves to ourselves in the mirror and to our future generations about what we did in [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=514.76s)]
*  this moment. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=520.48s)]
*  Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of Indivisible. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=521.48s)]
*  Mr. Levin, thank you for your time tonight. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  I appreciate you being here. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=525.6s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwhKYDuOsw&t=526.6s)]
