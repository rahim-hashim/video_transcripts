# Warnock: Trump using military to convince us 'we are at war with one another'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q)
*  Joining me now is Georgia Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock. He's also the senior pastor of Atlanta's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Once led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Senator. We've got a lot to talk about including the legislation [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=6.86s)]
*  That's before you and your colleagues in the Senate. I want to start with this remarkable sort of inversion [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=12.76s)]
*  We've seen the federalization of National Guard troops over the objection of a governor [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=17.78s)]
*  4000 set to be deployed throughout the California active-duty military [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=23.26s)]
*  Marines in California [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=27.54s)]
*  What do you think about the president's actions? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=30.0s)]
*  Well, listen [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=33.28s)]
*  I come from the civil rights tradition as you point out and pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church where Dr. King served [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=35.28s)]
*  But those guards that in that case the National Guard was sent in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=43.0s)]
*  And summoned in a sense by a campaign that was trying to bring us together [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump is focused on trying to tear us apart and it's no mistake that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=54.04s)]
*  He is using and really abusing on on this week in which we celebrate the anniversary of the army [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=59.6s)]
*  He's using if you will the the symbolism and the uniforms of our [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=67.88s)]
*  Service members in a campaign to do what he's been doing for ten years and that is to convince us [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=74.72s)]
*  That we are at war with one another [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=80.76s)]
*  That's really his project. He's trying to divide us because people who have no vision traffic and division [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=83.44s)]
*  He's trying to divide us in order to to rule over us. That's the way dictators and and autocrats [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=90.88s)]
*  That that is their modus operandi [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=98.16s)]
*  We can't be distracted because right now he's trying to pass his so-called big beautiful bill that will [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=100.4s)]
*  literally create a context in which as many as [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=108.44s)]
*  16 million Americans could lose their health care and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=111.56s)]
*  And almost everybody in America is gonna see their health care costs go up [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=116.56s)]
*  Even if you buy private insurance, that's what we're not saying enough [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=121.16s)]
*  But we were focused on this back in 2017 by the way [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=124.68s)]
*  I was here in 2017 as an activist pastor in the tradition of of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=128.16s)]
*  Peaceful protests and protests must always remain peaceful. I was engaged in acts of civil disobedience [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  I was arrested in the very building that I now work in as a senator representing Georgia [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=139.56s)]
*  Fighting for health care and all of these years later. I intend to continue that fight [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  Several years ago. It was as an agitator now [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm blessed to be a legislator to translate my protests in the public policy to stand up for health care, which is a human right [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=153.52s)]
*  One thing I heard and what you were saying there and I've read numerous political analysts say this and reporting on the White House [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  That they relish this fight over [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=167.68s)]
*  Immigration law and order and I think they may be wrong on this. I want to be clear [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=171.8s)]
*  I don't think they have some magical rhetorical trump card [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=175.44s)]
*  But they would choose that over talking about a bill that's going to cut taxes for people that inherit 20 million dollars homes [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=178.84s)]
*  from from their relatives and kick 14 million people off Medicaid [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=185.84s)]
*  Because that's a hard thing for them to kind of message around. Oh [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=191.44s)]
*  It's very unpopular and and they know it they and here's what they also know [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=195.76s)]
*  They they claim that they were looking for waste fraud and abuse [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=201.12s)]
*  There's not enough waste fraud and abuse to justify [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=204.88s)]
*  800 billion dollars worth of cuts [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=209.36s)]
*  out of Medicaid and here's why I I certainly know this is the case because [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=212.96s)]
*  On the night of the Voter Rama when when they were putting forth this project the initial steps [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=217.28s)]
*  I put forward an amendment that simply said [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=223.6s)]
*  Will you affirm that you will not cut anybody off of coverage that you will not be cutting coverage? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=227.76s)]
*  And of course that amendment was voted down because they know that the math doesn't work [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=233.68s)]
*  They they it's clear what they're trying to do they with these work [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=238.16s)]
*  Reporting requirements they are using the Georgia model and I know something about that model because I live in the state of Georgia [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=242.64s)]
*  I represent Georgia and Georgia is the only state right now [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=249.52s)]
*  That has these onerous work reporting requirements and let me be clear. It's not work requirements. It's work reporting requirements [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  And and the goal there is is not to incentivize work [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=262.16s)]
*  It's to kick people off of their health care if you've got a certified not annually, but every six months [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=266.16s)]
*  Imagine that that you deserve or need this health care every [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=272.08s)]
*  Six months you you've got to go through all of this red tape. We've seen what that does in Georgia [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=275.76s)]
*  It does not incentivize work [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=280.88s)]
*  It kicks working people off of health care, which is why we we the governor's is signed up [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  7 000 or so people [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  On in the Medicaid program in Georgia through his pathways to coverage which he ought to call roadblock [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  roadblocks to coverage [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=300.8s)]
*  They are now trying to take this failed Georgia model [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=302.88s)]
*  And then spread it throughout the entire country and what you ought to ask yourselves is why are they doing that? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=306.32s)]
*  It's because they want to kick people off of health care [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=311.68s)]
*  They want to make it hard for states that might want to expand to expand and what and why are they doing all of this? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=315.12s)]
*  In service to a tax cut to billionaires the wealthiest people in the country while at the same time adding three [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  Trillion dollars to the national debt. It is morally wrong. It is fiscally irresponsible [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=329.04s)]
*  It will be a drag on our economy [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=335.44s)]
*  I think it has the potential of pulling us into a recession with all of these other awful policies [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=337.68s)]
*  This 10 tax on everything, uh through the tariffs and donald trump would rather put on a show [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=343.36s)]
*  In los angeles than do what people in georgia who voted him for him? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  Hired him to do and that is to take their costs down [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=355.2s)]
*  Every single day he's driving up costs driving up the temperature in our nation trying to divide us [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=358.4s)]
*  Because he has no vision for the country [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=365.44s)]
*  You [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgz7mjAx7Q&t=385.12s)]
