# 'F---ing polygraph' him: Hegseth erratic, insecure and yelling at Pentagon officials
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M)
*  Welcome back. We're back with more on our top story this hour. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=0.0s)]
*  under growing scrutiny for erratic behavior at the Pentagon, including officials describing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=5.44s)]
*  screaming matches and threats to force top military leaders to take polygraph tests after [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=10.0s)]
*  a series of leaks. There's also brand new reporting that Hegseth had a special internet line set up in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  his office to use the Signal app in defiance of Defense Department policy. That's according to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=21.68s)]
*  officials familiar with the matter. Joining us now is Sabrina Singh, former Deputy Press Secretary [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=27.6s)]
*  for the Pentagon. Sabrina, if this was anyone else in any other administration, would they still [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  have their job at this point? I think if this was anyone else, the answer would be no. I think there [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=40.32s)]
*  would be no question not only would they have been hauled in front of Congress right away, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=46.96s)]
*  probably multiple hearings on the Hill, but they probably would have been removed from office pretty [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=51.2s)]
*  quickly and probably at the direction of the president. So what we're seeing here is sort of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=56.88s)]
*  unprecedented behavior, but also nothing new from this administration. We know that Donald Trump [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  does like the way Pete Hegseth goes out there and defends him every single day. So while in any other [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  administration, I think Democrat or Republican, things would be different. Unfortunately, that's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=73.92s)]
*  not the case here. When it comes specifically to this special internet line that Secretary Hegseth [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=79.04s)]
*  had installed, can you walk us through what would and wouldn't be allowed under DOD policy [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=84.4s)]
*  when it comes to that? Well, that completely flies in the face of DOD policy. And basically what Pete [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=89.68s)]
*  Hegseth did was choose convenience over cybersecurity. Working in the Pentagon, you do sit in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=95.2s)]
*  secure office spaces, rooms that can handle classified information. These are called skiffs. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=103.28s)]
*  That's what the Secretary of Defense's office is. It is a skiff. It allows them to access [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=109.44s)]
*  classified information at the highest levels. And you are not allowed to bring your personal [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=113.84s)]
*  phones into these rooms because it's not safe. And so when you bring a personal device or install, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=119.44s)]
*  in this case, a private internet line so he can access signal on a personal desktop, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=126.4s)]
*  that widens the aperture for adversaries and cyber hacking groups to try and hack into the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=134.4s)]
*  Secretary's personal devices. This is a device or a desktop that's not going to have the same [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=140.48s)]
*  security protocols as a work computer or classified systems. And so basically what the Secretary has [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=145.76s)]
*  done yet again is put at risk our national security. And most damaging and most importantly here that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=153.2s)]
*  should be highlighted is that he's putting at risk our military, our men and women in uniform, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  by the fact that he has a personal line like this installed in his office, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=166.0s)]
*  which he does not need for any reason at all. And counterintel people have said that he would be [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=169.84s)]
*  probably in the top five of folks who would be targeted for espionage by Ford adversaries. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=177.28s)]
*  Sabrina, there's also just a culture issue that we're reporting on today that he's creating at [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=183.84s)]
*  the Pentagon acting erratic, yelling. Here's just one example. When he learned about the leak of the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=189.44s)]
*  second signal chat, Hegseth screamed at the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying he [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=195.2s)]
*  will effing polygraph him to find out if he leaked the information about the meeting, according to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=201.28s)]
*  three U.S. officials familiar with the meeting. Plus, Politico has this reporting today writing [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=206.48s)]
*  that the staff is now focused on building an aura around Hegseth by pushing out videos of his [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  memo signings and early morning workouts, causing fears from current and former defense officials [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=218.32s)]
*  that some of the less photo worthy events could face delays. What does all of this mean for just [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=223.76s)]
*  day to day operations? You know, I greatly appreciate that he likes to engage with the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  troops and work out with them, but I really like it as if he focused on his job. The secretary of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=236.16s)]
*  defense, that job is very complex. It is very intense. There's a lot that goes into it. And [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=242.0s)]
*  the priority should always be protecting our men and women in uniform and our civilian workforce [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=250.0s)]
*  that are there. And you have the absolute utmost professionals working on the joint staff, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=256.0s)]
*  supporting the secretary. And that's what they're there to do, to help the secretary in this role. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  And what I'd like to see is him actually rely on these people around him, use their trust, use their [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=266.88s)]
*  strength and their long history of working in the military, some serving over 30 years, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=274.32s)]
*  and really focus on the job at hand. Sabrina Singh, appreciate your insights. Thank you very much [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=279.76s)]
*  for being with us. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=286.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6os6a_-07M&t=304.32s)]
