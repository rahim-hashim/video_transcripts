# New research shows benefits of a four-day work week
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk)
*  Welcome back. New data shows adopting a four-day workweek could have outstanding results for both employees and employers alike. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=0.0s)]
*  A new study of businesses and nonprofits who adopted a four-day workweek shows nearly 70 percent of workers experienced reduced burnout, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=10.0s)]
*  while 42 percent reported better mental health. Employers saw positive results in revenue, along with fewer absences and resignations. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=18.0s)]
*  Joining us now, economist and professor of sociology at Boston College, Juliet Shor. She's the author of the new book, Four Days a Week, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=26.0s)]
*  which shares her analysis of the benefits of a shorter workweek. That book is out today, so happy Pub Day, Juliet, and thank you for joining us to talk about this work, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=33.0s)]
*  because what's the case for the four-day workweek? And keep in mind, all of my bosses are listening right now. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=41.0s)]
*  Well, first, one thing I want to make clear, these companies are giving their employees for eight-hour days, so a 32-hour workweek with no reduction in pay. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=48.0s)]
*  And the case is that both employees and their employers are really thriving with it. So the well-being effects for employees may be, you know, expected. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=58.0s)]
*  We have 20 different measures of well-being, and they're going up, all of them, significantly over these six-month trials and then over longer periods of time as well. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=71.0s)]
*  I think the surprising thing is how much the businesses are thriving, and there are multiple reasons for that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=83.0s)]
*  For some of them, it's that they sort of tighten up, they take control of their meetings culture, they eliminate wasted time, and so they're able to be as productive in four days as five. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=91.0s)]
*  For others, it's a lot of fewer resignations. People stay. So there are different paths to success for the organizations. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=101.0s)]
*  I think it's going to perk a lot of people's ears up when you hear less meetings, less phone calls. I think that's something that a lot of people might strive for. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=113.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, not every workplace is the same. So how does this model work when you're talking about white-collar organizations versus construction industries or health care sectors, health care specifically, 24-7, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=122.0s)]
*  Absolutely. So we have companies in our studies, which have been going on since 2022, across all of those industries, and part of it is that they all do it differently. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=134.0s)]
*  So, for example, M2 Cheese, which is a restaurant chain in the southwest, just gives people their most overworked employees a day off. They don't ask them to be more productive. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=147.0s)]
*  Whereas some of the white-collar workers, where they do have a lot of sort of low productivity time, they tighten up. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=160.0s)]
*  Health care, it's more like the restaurant scene, where people are leaving in droves because they're burning out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=170.0s)]
*  And so keeping them healthy, keeping them on the job, that's really key to the success of those organizations. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=177.0s)]
*  Can you talk about the role that COVID played in this, if any? Because you've got companies now that are still trying to even just get their workforce back in the office for a few of the days of the week, not even all five. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=185.0s)]
*  But the idea of a four-day work week and the burnout that comes from employees that are working all of these hours, talk about the correlation, if there is any, between COVID and the moment that we're in right now in 2025. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=196.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question, Ollie. I always say that the pandemic turbocharged the four-day week movement because it was sort of kicking around before COVID. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=208.0s)]
*  But two things happened on the employee side, of course, those stress and burnout levels, disengagement, and then the great resignation. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=220.0s)]
*  All of those things just skyrocketed, putting employers in a tough spot. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=228.0s)]
*  But the other side of it is that the pandemic also opened up employers' minds. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=233.0s)]
*  It kind of, as one of them said to me, COVID taught us that we could trust our employees about where they work. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=241.0s)]
*  Now we're also realizing we can trust them about how much time they spend on the job. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=249.0s)]
*  So I think it just sort of scrambled things and made possible this old idea in a way that wasn't happening before. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=254.0s)]
*  And yet even you write that this four-day work week movement is probably pretty implausible in the world of conventional economics. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=264.0s)]
*  And yet companies are seeing upside in revenue and otherwise. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=271.0s)]
*  So what do you think? Do people do think that we're going to see more places adopting this kind of a four-day method? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=275.0s)]
*  And how would you even go about doing that in a writ large fashion? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=281.0s)]
*  Absolutely. I think we're on a sort of evolution toward it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=285.0s)]
*  If you look at on the one hand, the popularity among employees, but then also studies showing that 30 percent of employers are considering it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=289.0s)]
*  Also, the whole phenomenon of AI. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=299.0s)]
*  And one of the things we're seeing is that four-day week businesses are much more proficient and seem to be adopting AI at higher levels. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=304.0s)]
*  I heard yesterday from a New York legislator who's put two bills into the legislature this session for pilots like the ones that we've been doing. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=312.0s)]
*  So we're we're seeing more and more activity at the state level for for trying to push this new schedule. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=327.0s)]
*  It's a really fascinating trend. The work that you're doing to study it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=336.0s)]
*  Also so interesting in the new book called Four Days a Week, the life changing solution for reducing employee stress, improving well-being and working smarter is on sale today. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=340.0s)]
*  Again, happy publication day. Juliet Shore. Thank you for joining us. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=349.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciPv0KTOUk&t=357.0s)]
