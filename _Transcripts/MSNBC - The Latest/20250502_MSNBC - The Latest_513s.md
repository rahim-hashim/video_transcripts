# Will Mike Waltz be confirmed as UN Ambassador? Ex-CIA official slams ‘dangerous’ behavior
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA)
*  It's the nomination thrusting the signal app back into the spotlight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike Waltz's ouster as national security adviser is now expected to set up an explosive Senate [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=5.08s)]
*  confirmation hearing now that President Trump has nominated him to be U.S. ambassador to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=9.96s)]
*  the U.N. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=14.68s)]
*  Joining us now, Gabe Gutierrez reporting from Washington, D.C. and Ned Price, former senior [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  State Department and CIA official Brendan Buck is back with us. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=21.06s)]
*  Gabe, Waltz did not have to go through Senate confirmation to be NSA. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=25.52s)]
*  So what's the White House preparing for now? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=29.92s)]
*  Hi there, Chris. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=32.32s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=33.32s)]
*  Well, Democrats are chomping at the bit here to be able to question Mike Waltz under oath, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=34.32s)]
*  as you suggested during the Senate confirmation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=38.24s)]
*  But it's not just Democrats. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=40.8s)]
*  He could also face some opposition, it's possible, from some more conservative members of the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Republican Party, those that perhaps did not like his views on Ukraine. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=47.16s)]
*  Also, he's seen by that wing of the party, the MAGA group, as being more conservative, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=50.8s)]
*  a neoconservative viewed by some. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  He was an aide at one point to Dick Cheney. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=60.36s)]
*  And what the White House is doing right now is they're trying to spin this as a sort of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=63.68s)]
*  promotion for Mike Waltz. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=67.88s)]
*  Vice President J.D. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=69.4s)]
*  Vance yesterday in an interview suggesting as much, saying that the national security [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=70.4s)]
*  adviser did not need Senate confirmation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=75.12s)]
*  This position does, the UN ambassador and Vice President J.D. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=77.28s)]
*  Vance suggesting that if President Trump had wanted to fire Mike Waltz earlier, he would [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=81.48s)]
*  have done so. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=86.68s)]
*  But certainly, it appears that he definitely had his opponents within the administration. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=87.68s)]
*  And he looks to be set up for another bruising, for a bruising confirmation battle in the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=93.0s)]
*  Senate when that does happen, Chris. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=96.76s)]
*  That's certainly what Democrats are saying, Ned. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=99.2s)]
*  And those lawmakers are gearing up for this hearing already. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=101.44s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=104.84s)]
*  What kind of information might they have the potential of uncovering? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=105.84s)]
*  Well, Chris, the fact that he was nominated for this role almost begs the question as [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=109.24s)]
*  to whether Donald Trump did this to someone he clearly does not like to see him squirm [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  and to actually see him on the hot seat. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=120.88s)]
*  But as Chris Coons and other senators have said, they are rightly going to hold him to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=123.4s)]
*  account for his behavior during his time as national security adviser. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=127.96s)]
*  And even this week during the Cabinet meeting, we have another exhibit of his reckless and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  dangerous behavior in that now former role. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's leave aside the fact that he was texting during a Cabinet meeting. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=141.32s)]
*  Let's even leave aside the fact that he was using signals, something for which he's been [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=144.6s)]
*  on the hot seat for weeks during a Cabinet meeting. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=148.72s)]
*  The fact that we saw photographic evidence that he had recent signal text with the vice [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=151.76s)]
*  president of the United States, with Steve Witkoff, with other senior officials, and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=157.64s)]
*  most alarmingly to me with Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=162.4s)]
*  something that Democrats will need to get into during his confirmation hearing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  There is literally nothing that the national security adviser or then national security [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  adviser, I should say, and the serving director of national intelligence could be discussing [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  over the phone. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  This was an incoming voice call from Tulsi Gabbard that would not be of interest to foreign [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=182.68s)]
*  intelligence agencies, even if it was purely social, which, by the way, I doubt because [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=187.12s)]
*  the incoming call from Tulsi Gabbard came at something like six in the morning or six [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=191.72s)]
*  forty five in the morning to Mike Waltz. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=195.44s)]
*  So Democrats will have not only the obligation but the need to find out the extent to which [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=198.52s)]
*  Mike Waltz and some of his colleagues throughout the administration were being reckless in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=205.56s)]
*  this use of private private sector communications platforms like Signal during their [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=209.8s)]
*  time in office. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=216.4s)]
*  Brendan, do you think that President considered how nominating Waltz would reignite the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=217.88s)]
*  Signalgate scandal? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=223.84s)]
*  I mean, what? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=225.8s)]
*  Obviously, I'm asking you to speculate, but there are questions to be raised because it [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=228.44s)]
*  was obvious to I was on the air when it was breaking. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=234.0s)]
*  The first thing everybody said is, OK, now there's a confirmation hearing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=236.96s)]
*  It was the first thing that went through my mind. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=242.04s)]
*  Is he actually going to get confirmed? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=243.84s)]
*  And I think he will. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  And it's certainly a distraction. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=247.28s)]
*  But I think this all gets back to Donald Trump's psyche that you sort of you never really fire [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=250.44s)]
*  anybody. Maybe you demote people. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=255.88s)]
*  You don't really ever admit error. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  So you had to find somewhere to stash him. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=261.16s)]
*  And this was a convenient place to stash him after Elise Stefanik had stepped back from or [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=262.52s)]
*  been forced to step back from from her nomination. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=267.36s)]
*  I think he's going to be confirmed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=271.44s)]
*  I think it's going to be an uncomfortable hearing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=273.76s)]
*  Obviously, Democrats have a lot to work with. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=276.0s)]
*  But this isn't a situation where you have a Tulsi Gabbard, where it's a person completely out of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=279.32s)]
*  step with long held GOP foreign policy views. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=283.12s)]
*  You know, you have people like Mitch McConnell before who didn't like Tulsi, didn't like [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=287.64s)]
*  Pete Hegseth and was willing to vote against them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=293.28s)]
*  One of the reasons I think Mike was was removed was because he holds traditional GOP more [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=297.08s)]
*  hawkish views. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=301.2s)]
*  And so I think be fine on the substance with with GOP senators. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  And Mike was, I think, capable of getting through a hearing like that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=307.24s)]
*  It's just very unfortunate that they had to find themselves in here. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=312.0s)]
*  I think the bigger problem for me is who are you going to be replacing him with and are they [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=315.16s)]
*  going to resort back to that more isolationist, Trumpy worldview where the United States [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=319.56s)]
*  doesn't have a strong role in the world? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=325.36s)]
*  I think that's ultimately what his downfall was. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and as you well know, Ned, right now, Marco Rubio has taken over as interim a national [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=329.44s)]
*  security adviser, which means he holds four jobs, Secretary of State, of course, but he's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=334.4s)]
*  also the acting head of USAID and the acting archivist of the National Archives. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=339.44s)]
*  Here's what former national security adviser Jake Sullivan told Morning Joe about all that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=344.96s)]
*  I spent four years as national security adviser and not one of those days that I say, hey, I've [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=351.52s)]
*  got some spare time to be secretary of state as well. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=356.68s)]
*  So I think trying to do both jobs at once, maybe that worked back in Kissinger's era 50 [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=359.0s)]
*  years ago. But we have a competitive world. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=363.47999999999996s)]
*  By the way, Henry Kissinger was the only person who said it worked even 50 years ago. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=366.08s)]
*  Yeah, a big emphasis on maybe. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  Maybe it worked. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=372.84s)]
*  OK, right. We have a very competitive world out there and we need a full team on the field. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  So, Ned, what does it say? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  What that very decision to have Rubio do for full time jobs? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  Tell us. Yeah, Chris, to Jake's point, I [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  can attest to having received emails from Jake at two and three in the morning. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=388.8s)]
*  So it is certainly true that he did not have time to take on another cabinet role. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  Look, when it comes to Rubio, I think it's fair to call him probably the most titled, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=396.0s)]
*  but in some ways the least empowered man in Washington. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=401.64s)]
*  And I say that precisely because he does hold these four August titles. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=404.6s)]
*  But when you go through them one by one, you see that in some ways they mean much less [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  than they actually should. In terms of secretary of state, he has been forced to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=414.76s)]
*  cede so much of the most important diplomacy to people like Steve Witkoff, who is leading [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=418.64s)]
*  diplomacy with Iran, between Israel and Hamas, who is working between Russia and Ukraine, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=422.84s)]
*  people like Rick Brunel, who have engaged with Venezuela and other special missions. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=430.08s)]
*  And really, Rubio's marquee achievement, what he calls his achievement, the fact that [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=434.96s)]
*  he's revoked so many student visas, even that has been at least partially undone by this [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=439.15999999999997s)]
*  administration. Clearly, he's not doing a whole lot with the National Archives. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=444.32s)]
*  He was placed there only because Trump wanted the previous archivist fired because that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=447.56s)]
*  person had the temerity to say it was wrong of him to take classified documents to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=452.8s)]
*  USAID is completely dismantled, so he's not doing anything there. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=458.84s)]
*  And when it comes to the national security adviser, that should be more than a 24-7 job. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=463.6s)]
*  I say should be because this administration has no regard for the process and so much of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=468.56s)]
*  that role is overseeing the process, litigating debates and discussion between the Defense [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=473.24s)]
*  Department and the intelligence community and the State Department and so on. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=479.2s)]
*  Clearly, that is not happening because everything is decided by Donald Trump and Stephen [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=482.08s)]
*  Miller. There is no need for process in this administration, which I think works to the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=487.24s)]
*  detriment of our national security in the end. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIgHvOyNvA&t=490.88s)]
