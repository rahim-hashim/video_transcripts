# Attorney General Pam Bondi speaks after Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been charged by federal grand jury
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q)
*  Hi, everybody. It's 4 o'clock in New York. We come on the air with breaking news. A federal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=0.0s)]
*  grand jury has indicted Kilmar Abrego-Garcia. He is the Maryland man and Salvadoran national [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=5.72s)]
*  who was deported by the Trump administration in violation of a court order. He is now being [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  charged with two counts, conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gains [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=18.02s)]
*  and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gains. That is according to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=24.92s)]
*  a copy of the indictment obtained by NBC News. Other news organizations are also reporting [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  that Abrego-Garcia is returning home to the United States to face those two charges. We [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=35.74s)]
*  should note NBC News has not confirmed that piece of the report. An attorney for Kilmar [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia is reacting to the reporting by saying this, quote, The government disappeared [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Kilmar to a foreign prison in violation of a court order. Now, after months of delay [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=51.52s)]
*  and secrecy, they are bringing him back not to correct their error, but to prosecute him. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=56.52s)]
*  This shows that they were playing games at the court all along. Due process means the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=62.56s)]
*  chance to defend yourself before you are punished, not after. This is an abuse of power, not [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=67.0s)]
*  justice. The government should put him on trial, yes, but in front of the same immigration [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=73.36s)]
*  judge who heard his case in 2019, which is the ordinary manner of doing things to ensure [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=78.68s)]
*  that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  Salvador as the Supreme Court ordered. Any moment now, Attorney General Pam Bondi will [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  hold a press conference. He has, we actually can confirm now that he has landed in the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  United States. So knowing that we are going to listen in to Pam Bondi for a minute. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=101.2s)]
*  Alien smuggling in violation of title eight USC 1324. We want to thank President Buckeye [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=106.64s)]
*  for agreeing to return a brego Garcia to the United States. Our government presented El [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=114.6s)]
*  Salvador with an arrest warrant and they agreed to return him to our country. We're grateful [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  to President Buckeye for agreeing to return him to our country to face these very serious [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=127.56s)]
*  charges. This is what American justice looks like. Upon completion of a sentence, we anticipate [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=133.76s)]
*  he will be returned to his home country of El Salvador. The grand jury found that over [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=140.52s)]
*  the past nine years of rego Garcia has played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=147.52s)]
*  They found this was his full time job, not a contractor. He was a smuggler of humans [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=157.56s)]
*  and children and women. He made over 100 trips. The grand jury found smuggling people throughout [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=165.2s)]
*  our country. MS 13 members, violent gang terrorist organization members throughout our country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=176.54s)]
*  Thousands of illegal aliens were smuggled. This is especially disturbing because a break [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=187.8s)]
*  of Garcia is also alleged with transporting minor children. The defendant traded the innocence [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=196.8s)]
*  of minor children for profit. There are even more disturbing facts that the grand jury [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  uncovered. It is alleged this defendant is part of the same smuggling ring responsible [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=212.52s)]
*  for the death of more than 50 migrants in 2021 after the tractor trailer overturned [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=218.24s)]
*  in Mexico. This is part of that same ring. The defendant abused undocumented alien females, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=225.36s)]
*  according to co conspirators who were under his control while transporting them throughout [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  our country. This defendant trafficked firearms and narcotics throughout our country on multiple [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=241.16s)]
*  occasions. They were using vehicles, SUVs with added seats in the back floors that had [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=250.16s)]
*  been ripped out guns, narcotics, Children, women, MS 13 members. That is what the grand [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=257.76s)]
*  jury found. A co conspirator alleged that the defendant solicited nude photographs and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=267.48s)]
*  videos of a minor. A co conspirator also alleges the defendant played a role in the murder [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=275.6s)]
*  of a rival gang members mother. These facts demonstrate a break of Garcia is a danger [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=281.38s)]
*  to our community. We want to thank the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, our state and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=289.0s)]
*  local partners are acting U. S. Attorney Robert Maguire and prosecutors from the Joint [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=297.4s)]
*  Task Force Vulcan. Questions. Attorney General, the traffic stop that we've seen video of [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=303.76s)]
*  from Tennessee where a bird Garcia was was first identified by the local authorities [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=316.4s)]
*  at the time, the Homeland Security Department declined to take custody of him. What has [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=322.96s)]
*  happened in between that time and in between the time that the government has been arguing [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=327.47999999999996s)]
*  that he was not returnable from El Salvador? What has happened since in this investigation [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=332.52s)]
*  that brought you here? Yes, the question was in 2021, there was the traffic stop and what [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=338.46s)]
*  has changed since then? What has changed is Donald Trump is now president of the United [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  States and our borders are again secure. And thanks to the bright light that has been shined [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=349.34s)]
*  on a break of Garcia, this investigation continued with actually amazing police work and we were [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=356.09999999999997s)]
*  able to track this case and stop this international smuggling ring from continuing recently found [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=363.58s)]
*  Yes, recently found facts. Can you just explain when this investigation was opened? The investigation [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=375.54s)]
*  in Tennessee, can you say when that investigation was opened? Well, the grand jury indicted [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=382.46000000000004s)]
*  on May 21st. This investigation has been ongoing. In your mind, does this resolve that issue [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=386.42s)]
*  in terms of his deportation? And should this be seen in any way as compliant with the judge's [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=398.08000000000004s)]
*  order to return him to the US and the Supreme Court ruling that the US government should [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=403.1s)]
*  facilitate his return? There's a big difference between what the state of play was before [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=407.38s)]
*  the indictment and after the indictment. And so the reason why he is back and was returned [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=416.62s)]
*  was because there's an arrest warrant, which was presented to the government in El Salvador. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=423.66s)]
*  So there's a big difference there. As far as whether it makes the ongoing litigation [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=428.62s)]
*  in Maryland moot, I would think so. But we don't know about this. He just landed today. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=434.1s)]
*  Jake, somebody else? I just want to confirm what you said earlier, that you're intending [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=440.02s)]
*  to prosecute him and keep him in an American prison if he's found guilty and then would [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=447.02s)]
*  remove him after his sentence is over. Correct. Yes, he will be prosecuted in our country, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=450.98s)]
*  in our country if convicted and then returned after completion of his sentence. Last one, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=457.5s)]
*  Sadie, Infantry Journal. Okay. I have two. One's on top of one's off top of. Maybe I [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=464.5s)]
*  misunderstood you, but you were mentioning that he had some involvement in a murder or [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=472.02s)]
*  was connected to groups that had involved with this other smuggling ring. But to be [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=477.54s)]
*  clear, the only charges he's facing right now are the human smuggling charges. That's [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=483.18s)]
*  the one offense. But the other things that you have talked about are not actually in [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=491.42s)]
*  the indictment? No, co-conspirators allege that. And we were clear to say that he is [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=495.14s)]
*  charged with not only very serious charges of alien smuggling. And again, there were [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=501.22s)]
*  children involved in that. You know, human trafficking, not only in our country but in [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=508.02000000000004s)]
*  our world, is very, very real. It's very dangerous. And as you saw recently in Virginia, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=512.4200000000001s)]
*  the arrest we made of the MS-13 member unrelated to this, we learned at that press conference [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=520.88s)]
*  that's where they bring young children into our country and they start grooming them at [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=527.34s)]
*  middle school age to become MS-13 full-fledged members commit violent crimes throughout our [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=531.86s)]
*  country. It is highly organized. It is very dangerous. And they are living throughout [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=540.0600000000001s)]
*  our country, but no more because they are being arrested, they are being prosecuted [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=547.62s)]
*  and being convicted and deported when appropriate. That's all for today. Thank you. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zCeiyJ07Q&t=553.98s)]
