# Which party fights for people like you? Many Americans think ‘neither’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc)
*  A new NBC News stay-tuned poll asked Americans a simple question. Which party fights for people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=0.0s)]
*  like you? The answer from pretty much everyone? None of them. Let's just take a look at these [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=5.76s)]
*  numbers. 38% of respondents said neither party. 24% said the Republican Party and 23% said only [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=10.48s)]
*  the Democratic Party. It's something Illinois governor and potential 2028 Democratic candidate [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=18.32s)]
*  J.B. Pritzker says has got to change. In a speech just last night, he called on Democrats to fight, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=23.2s)]
*  everywhere and all at once. Fellow Democrats, for far too long we've been guilty of listening [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  to a bunch of do-nothing political types who would tell you that America's house is not on fire, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=36.24s)]
*  even as the flames were licking their faces. All right, we want to bring in NBC News senior [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=43.12s)]
*  national political reporter Natasha Karecki and also here with us host of the Bullwark podcast [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  and MSNBC political analyst Tim Miller. Tim, those are low numbers for any party, but for [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=53.28s)]
*  Democrats who are aspirationally trying to take back some power in 2026, what do those numbers tell [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  them? Well, look, I think it tells them that the Democrats have essentially a core base about a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=64.8s)]
*  quarter of the country. There's some college-educated suburban voters, black voters, particularly black [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=72.08s)]
*  women, some young voters, but not all anymore that losing ground with young voters. But all of these [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=78.72s)]
*  folks, the thing that most of them have in common is that it's folks that are really engaged in the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  news and they know what the Democrats are up to and they're happy about it and they're Democrats. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=88.72s)]
*  The next group of people, people that Democrats did quite well with during the Obama era, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=94.0s)]
*  are people that don't pay attention to the news that closely, probably aren't watching cable news [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=98.48s)]
*  in the middle of the day right now, right? Like aren't reading the newspaper every day or reading [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=102.32s)]
*  it online every day. And Democrats got to figure out how to signal to those folks that they care [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=105.92s)]
*  about them. And I think that's how you get the number up from a quarter of the electorate to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=111.04s)]
*  closer to half of the electorate where they need it to be to be successful. And I think that's where [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=114.56s)]
*  the challenge comes in, where a lot of times the Democrat solutions is to continue talking in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  in their echo chamber when you really got to broaden it out and get to people who are busy, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=122.88s)]
*  who have kids, who are working, you know, who have jobs, who are maybe getting bad information from [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=127.28s)]
*  social media, from TikTok, you know, from Twitter, from Elon Musk's platform. And so it's a real big [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=131.76s)]
*  challenge, but it's something that they've got to keep in front of mind, I think, entirely between [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=137.12s)]
*  now and the next midterm. So what do you mean they're not watching us here in the middle of the day? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=141.04s)]
*  I'm just kidding. Natasha, Governor Pritzker put out this. So hopefully some of them are. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=145.12s)]
*  Look, Governor Pritzker put out this strong rallying cry for Democrats. Natasha, what was the impetus [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=151.28s)]
*  behind that? And do we think it landed and had whatever the intended effect was? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=156.72s)]
*  Yeah, so I take a couple takeaways from last night. I mean, one, I think since really November, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=162.8s)]
*  Pritzker has been trying to position himself or president positioning himself as someone who's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=168.32s)]
*  not just afraid to, you know, assail Donald Trump, even even in the very beginning when some Democrats [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=172.88s)]
*  were tiptoeing around it because they saw the winnings, they saw the battlegrounds, the blue [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=178.0s)]
*  states, the blue wall go down. He wasn't afraid of those days and second guessing himself. So he [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=182.64s)]
*  was kind of trying to remind Democrats that he was there doing that from the beginning. What he's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=189.76s)]
*  calling for now is this aggressive posture, you know, taking to the streets, protesting, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=195.2s)]
*  you know, but he went a little further even in an interview with me. He said, you know, Trump's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=201.04s)]
*  cabinet needs to be investigated and held responsible if they're violent in the Constitution, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=206.32s)]
*  and that is, you know, of course, if Democrats regained a majority in Congress. I would also say [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=212.16s)]
*  Pritzker has been interesting because he's completely unabashedly liberal. He is not, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=218.56s)]
*  you know, afraid to talk about trends. He's not afraid to talk about diversity in the workplace. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=223.44s)]
*  He's saying stop blaming those things for the reason that Democrats lost. He doesn't think [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=227.76s)]
*  that's why they lost, that those are things that Democrats should be defending and embracing. He's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=232.8s)]
*  saying that the loss is because Democrats and a lot of the, you know, and other voters and kind [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=238.64s)]
*  of voters think that Democrats aren't fighting for them because what they've seen year after year [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=244.55999999999997s)]
*  and time after time again is this incrementalism, this like not getting things done. And he said, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  that is the posture that people need to change. And my final takeaway, I would say, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=254.88s)]
*  just the reaction there. I mean, this is one room on one night, right? But, you know, 800 people [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  showed up. That's the biggest crowd that the New Hampshire Democrats have gotten for that annual [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=266.88s)]
*  dinner since 2020. And they couldn't get enough of it. They were eating up every bit of it. Does [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=271.2s)]
*  that mean they love Pritzker? You know, who knows? But he was hitting the message right at that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=277.2s)]
*  moment. They wanted a fighter. They wanted to hear somebody who was going to push back. And they [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=281.84s)]
*  wanted, you know, they wanted some movement against this administration. And Tim, I mean, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=285.76s)]
*  Pritzker is encouraging people to fight back. I mean, Politico puts his message to Democrats [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=291.68s)]
*  like this, drop the decorum and fight. So, you know, what happened to if they go low, we go high? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=296.96s)]
*  Is that over? Is it put up your fists and get in there? And is that something Democrats are [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=303.44s)]
*  looking for in a leader? I think it's pretty much over. And I do think the Democratic voters are [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=307.68s)]
*  looking for somebody that's going to fight and fight aggressively. It's very reminiscent. It's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  been a long time now. It's been about a decade since I was a Republican in good standing, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=316.56s)]
*  but it's very reminiscent of what we were hearing from Republican voters back in 2015, though I [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=319.84s)]
*  think the Democrats will be able to put up a fighter that maybe is more of a constructive fighter [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  is maybe a big understatement than what the Republicans did at that time. I'd say this, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=328.64s)]
*  though. The fighting isn't just enough. I think it's necessary, but not sufficient for somebody [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=333.12s)]
*  like Pritzker, because I think that being a fighter, being very aggressive, getting out [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=337.84s)]
*  in the streets is going to appeal to those 24 percent that we showed in the polls of people [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=342.0s)]
*  that are happy with the Democrats and want the Democrats to do more. But look, in the state of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=345.92s)]
*  Illinois, there were a lot of voters that went from Biden to Trump this time. There was a huge [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=350.48s)]
*  drop in the number at the top of the ticket from Democrats in his home state of Illinois. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=357.92s)]
*  I think that Pritzker can't just do the fighting. You've also got to talk to the voters who have [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=362.56s)]
*  been pretty unhappy with the governance in that state, working class voters in Chicago, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=366.24s)]
*  white working class voters outside of the cities. I think ignoring the fact that those folks [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=371.92s)]
*  turned on the Democrats in 2024 would be a big mistake. And so you've got to do both. You've [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=376.88s)]
*  got to fight, but also you've got to show that you're responsive to the concerns that those [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=382.16s)]
*  voters have from a governing standpoint. All right. Tim Miller, Natasha Karecki, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=386.0s)]
*  thank you both for joining us. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=390.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHekbyEvPc&t=401.92s)]
