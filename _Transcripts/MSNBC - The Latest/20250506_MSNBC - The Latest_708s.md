# 'Defining moment in history': Why Trump's trade war is 'taking chainsaw' to U.S.
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE)
*  Joining us now, NBC News White House correspondent Vaughn Hilliard, NBC News senior business [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=0.0s)]
*  correspondent Christine Romance, former Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer from California, and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=4.88s)]
*  Susan Del Percio, Republican strategist and MSNBC political analyst. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=9.8s)]
*  Vaughn, set the scene for us ahead of this meeting, set to get underway in moments. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=14.0s)]
*  What's the plan for the White House today? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=18.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=20.16s)]
*  This is going to be a defining moment here when we look back in history at what has effectively [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=21.16s)]
*  amounted to nearly two centuries of relations between the United States and Canada as not [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=27.0s)]
*  only free trade partners, but also allies in war. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=32.96s)]
*  This for the United States comes months after Justin Trudeau, then the prime minister, flew [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=36.84s)]
*  down over Thanksgiving weekend in November to meet directly with then incoming President [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=41.84s)]
*  Trump to try to steady relations between the two countries. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=48.36s)]
*  Ultimately, that did not come to fruition. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=52.52s)]
*  Instead, the president goaded him into the idea that he'd be the 51st governor of the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=54.96s)]
*  United States and that Canada would be incorporated into America. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=60.4s)]
*  Ultimately, Justin Trudeau left his post. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=64.72s)]
*  But then, in a dramatic fashion, Mark Carney of the Liberal Party rose to ascension, winning [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=67.88s)]
*  the vote and becoming the prime minister now here just days later, coming to the United [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  States to meet directly in the White House with the president. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=79.56s)]
*  We expect him to enter those West Wing doors in less than 30 minutes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=83.2s)]
*  The two men will then meet in the Oval Office for a bilateral meeting. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=88.16s)]
*  We anticipate our cameras going inside to see the initial interaction and words between [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  these two men. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=98.24s)]
*  Mark Carney had suggested after his victory that no longer would Canada not stand up to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=99.56s)]
*  the, quote, betrayal of President Trump and the United States. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  After that, the two men will then, in the Roosevelt Room, have lunch. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=110.1s)]
*  Of course, after that, it'll be really telling about the future of these two countries' [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=113.61999999999999s)]
*  relations in the words that both men speak once Mark Carney leaves the White House. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=117.5s)]
*  Yeah, they both have been kind of downplaying the expectations game going into this meeting [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=121.61999999999999s)]
*  with Mark Carney saying, don't expect white smoke, kind of referencing the pope election [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=125.86s)]
*  coming up. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=131.06s)]
*  But, Christine, as we're watching and waiting, what are businesses, what are investors going [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=132.06s)]
*  to be watching for coming out of today's meeting? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=137.94s)]
*  I mean, in a perfect world, as a reset of this relationship, it's an incredibly important [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=140.98s)]
*  relationship. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=145.02s)]
*  And when you look at what each side exports to the other side, the president says the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=146.02s)]
*  United States is subsidizing Canada, but, oh, the United States depends on a lot of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=149.54s)]
*  stuff coming from Canada. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=153.82s)]
*  Lumber, car parts, car parts cross the border multiple times. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=155.46s)]
*  You can see those are the biggest exports from both countries, reminding us that both [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=159.04s)]
*  The North American auto industry is successful on a global stage because of these two countries [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=164.06s)]
*  working together along with Mexico, so incredibly important here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=169.5s)]
*  And I think the reset, you know, Mark Carney is known as somebody who is a former central [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=174.18s)]
*  banker, of course, but he's a politician too, so he understands the global system, how it [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=178.74s)]
*  works, how everyone can win. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump sees winners and losers only. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=187.66000000000003s)]
*  Mark Carney is somebody who's made a career making sure everyone can win in the end, and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=190.3s)]
*  that's the skill he's got to bring to the table today. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=193.54000000000002s)]
*  Senator Boxer, Carney just won Canada's election last week, driven largely by Canadian backlash [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=195.66000000000003s)]
*  to Trump's trade war and the provocative rhetoric we've heard about Canada's sovereignty. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=200.82000000000002s)]
*  What do you see is on the line for President Trump politically today? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=207.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think President Trump is losing all over the world every time he gets involved [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  in one of these races, the liberals win. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=219.06s)]
*  So I think that, of course, the prime minister is taking a risk, but, you know, politics [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=223.06s)]
*  is taking risks. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=231.42s)]
*  And if it goes south, he could always say, Mr. President, we don't agree on this, I just [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=233.1s)]
*  want to really thank you for getting me elected. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=238.06s)]
*  But I think standing up to bullies is also very good politics. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=241.22s)]
*  I've done it in my life, and I think the way you do it when it's the president of the United [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=244.94000000000003s)]
*  States, Donald Trump, is to keep your cool, to tell the truth. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  And I think this guy knows how to do it, so I'm very interested in it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=256.98s)]
*  I admire the fact that he's coming here. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=260.58000000000004s)]
*  I agree with what has been said. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=262.90000000000003s)]
*  This is a crucial relationship. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=265.54s)]
*  It's so important. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=268.98s)]
*  We live in California. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=270.1s)]
*  We have so many Canadians who have part-time homes here. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=271.1s)]
*  They're shocked at what has happened. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=276.26s)]
*  So I like the fact that the two are going to be together. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=277.86s)]
*  I think, Susan, one of the reasons there's so much anticipation going into this meeting [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=281.18s)]
*  isn't just because of the impact of the tariffs that are being felt and what could come, but [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=286.38s)]
*  also because we think about that Zelensky meeting that happened in the Oval Office a few months [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=291.46000000000004s)]
*  back and the big blow up. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=296.42s)]
*  Will President Trump go there with Mark Carney? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=298.7s)]
*  And if he does, what should Carney do? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=301.3s)]
*  Well, I think first, Carney should go in not with the conception of, I think, unfortunately, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=303.3s)]
*  a lot of world leaders have gone on to meet Trump with this idea, I could get him if I'm [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=309.82s)]
*  nice to him or I should play this card or I should do this, based on the persona of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=314.3s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=320.7s)]
*  I kind of think more about the Bill Maher meeting with Trump. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=321.7s)]
*  Go in who you are. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=325.02s)]
*  Who Carney is is someone Donald Trump can really relate to. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=326.86s)]
*  He wasn't a politician before he was prime minister. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=330.98s)]
*  He's a businessman. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=334.3s)]
*  Like Kristen said, he's used to dealing in a global sense. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=335.82s)]
*  He will be respectful, I have no doubt. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=339.2s)]
*  And I think Trump would be more likely to lean in and be respectful to him. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=341.76s)]
*  And they could have a very good dialogue. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, what happens publicly after when they meet the president, that could be a little [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=349.14s)]
*  different. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=353.38s)]
*  I suspect that Carney is going to have a very positive meeting with Donald Trump if he doesn't [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=354.38s)]
*  go in trying to play Donald Trump. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=358.94s)]
*  I mean, if there is to be a deal that comes out of this, Christine, what does a win look [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=361.26s)]
*  like for the U.S.? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=364.46s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's Donald Trump does not think that trade deficits are or trade between [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=365.46s)]
*  two countries benefit both people. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=371.7s)]
*  He sees winners and losers and he thinks the U.S. is being ripped off. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=374.02s)]
*  So it's a very difficult position to start from in terms of a negotiating position. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=376.58s)]
*  And the biggest issue here really is the auto industry. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=381.78s)]
*  These are incredibly important industries with millions of workers on both sides of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=384.61999999999995s)]
*  the border. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=390.09999999999997s)]
*  And that's really got to get hammered out here so that both sides can have a win here. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=391.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, if you could pause some tariffs, boy, that would be amazing. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=396.58s)]
*  But this president doesn't seem to want to pause tariffs against Canada or Mexico. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=399.97999999999996s)]
*  Vaughn, we heard Commerce Secretary Lutnick using some really fiery words last night calling [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=403.61999999999995s)]
*  Canada a socialist regime. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=408.46s)]
*  So if that's setting the tone for this meeting, that's what that means. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=410.5s)]
*  But is there any concern the White House is going to end up leaving this meeting empty [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=414.14s)]
*  handed? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=418.38s)]
*  It seems to be that the Trump administration, to Christine's point, doesn't seem to be too [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=420.46s)]
*  concerned about insulting the neighbors to the north and the fact that the U.S. relies [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=425.32s)]
*  so heavily on Canadian goods that are imported into the United States. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=432.02s)]
*  Yet there has been no indication over the last six months since the president's election [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  to the White House that he or his cabinet officials have paid much deference to the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=440.90000000000003s)]
*  products that U.S. producers rely on and consumers rely on. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=447.54s)]
*  And we heard from Howard Lutnick last night suggesting, why are we relying on Canada for [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=453.38s)]
*  cars or car parts? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=459.3s)]
*  He used the term feed off of the United States to describe Canada's relation and need on [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=461.16s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=468.8s)]
*  And so there's little fanfare about this Oval Office visit, we should be clear, especially [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=469.8s)]
*  compared to others from Bibi Netanyahu to Salvador President Bukele's visit here to [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=475.20000000000005s)]
*  the White House. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=481.96000000000004s)]
*  Comparatively, there is much less fanfare. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  We know that Mark Carney is staying just about a block away at the Blair House. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=486.16s)]
*  But there is little reception, I guess, comparatively, just one week after his ascension to being [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=489.56s)]
*  the new prime minister. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=497.2s)]
*  I don't know if there's little fanfare given, just the broad impact that these tariffs are [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=498.2s)]
*  having on all Americans and all Canadians, presumably. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=502.88s)]
*  Senator Boxer, we've seen this White House target other allies with these tariffs, so [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=507.28s)]
*  Canada is not alone. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=511.08s)]
*  The New York Times reports European consumers are now starting to shift away from buying [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=513.08s)]
*  American products, that this could be long term. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=517.72s)]
*  For instance, they report in Germany and in Italy, developers are now creating apps that [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=520.0s)]
*  scan grocery and clothing items for people who want to make sure they're not buying [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=524.64s)]
*  American. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=529.28s)]
*  So, Senator, even if the administration does change course on its tariff policy, how much [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=530.28s)]
*  damage is already done? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=536.08s)]
*  Huge amount of damage done worldwide. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=539.52s)]
*  I told you about the Canadians, the real people who are here in California who are stunned [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=542.0s)]
*  and shocked and angry. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=547.0s)]
*  And this is happening all over the world. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=549.4799999999999s)]
*  You know, what Trump did with his minions is take a chainsaw to America all over the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=551.4s)]
*  place. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=559.4s)]
*  We know that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=560.4s)]
*  We don't have time to go into everything he's done. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=561.4s)]
*  But imagine taking a chainsaw to Social Security, to cancer research. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=562.8s)]
*  We could go on. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=568.88s)]
*  I won't. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=569.88s)]
*  But the fact is he took a chainsaw to our trade policy. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=570.88s)]
*  And that is the worst thing you could possibly do. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=575.76s)]
*  In the olden days, I was a stockbroker. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=578.36s)]
*  And one of the things we said was we need certainty. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=581.42s)]
*  This has thrown uncertainty into our economy in the worst possible way. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=585.68s)]
*  And it has terrible ramifications. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=592.1s)]
*  And the last point I'll make is Trump seems to forget we also export billions of dollars [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=595.3199999999999s)]
*  to Canada. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=601.06s)]
*  Billions. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=602.06s)]
*  Yes, we buy more from them. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=603.06s)]
*  That's what fair trade is. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=606.3599999999999s)]
*  And that's what we've had in this country for a long time. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=607.9599999999999s)]
*  But what about our people who need to export our products? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=611.0s)]
*  The last I looked, it was $28 billion to Canada, one of our largest trading partners. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=616.16s)]
*  So they're taking a chainsaw to everything. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=622.3599999999999s)]
*  It's horrific. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=625.3599999999999s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=626.3599999999999s)]
*  I hope today goes well. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=627.3599999999999s)]
*  You know, I do agree with Susan. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=628.92s)]
*  I think that this could be a very good meeting if the prime minister doesn't get played and [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=630.68s)]
*  just is very strong and calm and sincere. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=637.88s)]
*  Christine, what about those exports we just heard Senator Boxer mention? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=641.68s)]
*  They're already down. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=646.4799999999999s)]
*  And I look at farm exports, beef, soybeans, corn. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=647.4799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm the granddaughter of corn farmers. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=650.76s)]
*  You know, like, I look at these numbers and it's really, it's heartbreaking that there [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=652.56s)]
*  will be real trouble in the Plains states because of these exports are down. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=656.52s)]
*  So we've got imports down because companies here are canceling their China orders. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=661.72s)]
*  At the same time, even before the bite, the numbers I'm looking at, or even before the bite [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=666.52s)]
*  of the biggest parts of the tariffs, already other countries have been importing less from us as well. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=670.72s)]
*  So the president, the trade policy is meant to wean us off of imports at the same time. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=677.52s)]
*  It's hurting what we make and what we export to. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=683.1999999999999s)]
*  And that's what a trade war is. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=685.76s)]
*  That's why everybody loses. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXTEKCj1PE&t=686.76s)]
