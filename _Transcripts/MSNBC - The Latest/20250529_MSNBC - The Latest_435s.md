# ‘Baloney rhetoric’: Michael Steele on WH slamming the judges who ruled against Trump
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY)
*  One could argue that the court is actually saving Donald Trump from himself, given that we have not felt the full inflationary pressures of these tariffs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=0.0s)]
*  People are, you know, we're going to see the difference in our shelves soon. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=8.16s)]
*  But I wonder what it tells you, one, that it required the courts to actually stop this. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=12.88s)]
*  And if you could assess for us the damage that has already been done by these tariffs and what it will require to undo that damage. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=19.2s)]
*  I was just trying to think back on all of the steps that have happened so far and imagine myself as a business person trying to make investment decisions in this environment. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=28.72s)]
*  Donald Trump campaigned on a 10 percent tariff. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=36.72s)]
*  Then he came in in April and decided to do the Liberation Day tariffs, which are much higher. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=39.599999999999994s)]
*  Then there was a negotiation down, but then a push up of the China tariffs. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=43.839999999999996s)]
*  And then there was a 90 day pause. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=47.7s)]
*  And that just imagine trying to make these decisions. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=49.04s)]
*  And now you're facing the uncertainty of these tariffs being blocked by a court but allowed to continue for some period of time until the Supreme Court likely has to weigh in on it, which could take several months from now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=51.6s)]
*  So this is going to have a chilling effect on investment. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=61.84s)]
*  It already has had a chilling effect on investment. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=64.76s)]
*  And that's going to trickle down into job growth, into economic growth, into wage gains, all the things that affect Americans in their everyday lives. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=67.4s)]
*  I want to make one other important point here, which is that if these tariffs are in fact found to be illegal, then by law, the tariffs have to be rescinded. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  In other words, the government has collected all of this money. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=82.68s)]
*  It has to give it back to the businesses that paid them. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  And it's about 20 billion dollars so far. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  But note, who gets the money back? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=90.84s)]
*  The businesses, not the consumers who've had to pay higher prices because businesses were facing tariffs. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  So if you actually look at that and the pass through rate in terms of higher prices, Americans already, the average American household is facing about one hundred and fifteen dollars of extra costs because of these tariffs for no gain because of all the back and forth so far. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=97.48s)]
*  I just want to know who to enforce it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=110.16s)]
*  Right. And is there an incentive then to lower those prices when they get that 20 billion dollars back? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=111.48s)]
*  Maybe. But if you in economic theory, there's a thing called sticky prices, which is once prices go up, it's awfully hard for them to start coming back down. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=118.0s)]
*  And again, if I'm a business person in this environment, given the uncertainty about when tariffs could come back. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=125.0s)]
*  And the other thing is that there are all sorts of other legal authorities available for Trump to impose tariffs. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  There's something called Section 301. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  There's something called Section 232. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=136.32s)]
*  He could use those authorities to take a different legal angle on imposing tariffs. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  So if I was a business person, I would say we're not out of the woods yet. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  Even the Supreme Court strikes this down. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=145.32s)]
*  There's still a good chance that some tariffs are going to be levied on me. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=147.24s)]
*  I'm not in a position to start dropping prices right away. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=149.88s)]
*  So, I mean, OK, I'm coming back to you because the consumers would like a word. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=155.28s)]
*  We're like, what's happening? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=159.6s)]
*  The business owners want to know what's going on. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  But so do the people who are buying things, who are trying to plan out, you know, their their monthly at this point biweekly budgets. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=162.56s)]
*  Ankush, I don't I don't really understand what's going on here with the courts. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=170.32s)]
*  I just I don't understand it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  Why let the tariffs stay in place? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  Oh, you know, I understand it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's a little counterintuitive. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=181.72s)]
*  It seems to be at odds with correct. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  Like if we don't know, why are you going to let them stand? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=185.32s)]
*  I think that there's it's actually kind of defensible from a legal standpoint. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=187.68s)]
*  This is the federal circuit that issued this day. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=190.84s)]
*  This is a court many people probably never even heard of. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  They are not usually in sort of the national spotlight. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=195.84s)]
*  I would note they're in this they were in the International Trade Court because the Trump administration thought it would be more favorable to them. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=198.88s)]
*  They wanted this court to write. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=205.16s)]
*  And, you know, in terms of like if you're if you're in their position and you're weighing like what is the effect of a stay versus no stay? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=206.76s)]
*  Well, no, stay means the administration is going to keep claiming that there's foreign policy, you know, whatever disruption or whatever. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=213.68s)]
*  But stay theoretically, it's just you're just adding on to more of the collection that you'll end up refunding if the tariffs are who enforces the refund? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=220.48s)]
*  Well, who will enforce the refund? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=230.32s)]
*  Like, technically, the government. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=232.28s)]
*  OK, technically, one of the common refrains that we have heard over and over again from Republicans is that federal judges are out of control, that they have too much authority. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=234.56s)]
*  And we heard a strain of that again this week in relation to this ruling. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  Take a listen. Three judges of the U.S. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=249.64s)]
*  Court of International Trade disagreed and brazenly abused their judicial power to usurp the authority of President Trump to stop him from carrying out the mandate that the American people [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=254.28s)]
*  gave him. The courts should have no role here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=263.64s)]
*  There is a troubling and dangerous trend of unelected judges inserting themselves into the presidential decision making process. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=266.32s)]
*  These judges are threatening to undermine the credibility of the United States on the world stage. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  I just want to follow the logic of the argument you're making, which is if the Supreme Court, which is now stacked with judges that Donald Trump himself appointed and chose, if they defy him on this, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=277.96s)]
*  how do they then make the argument to the American people, which is a ridiculous argument to begin with? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  But how do they continue to make the argument that this is just judges gone rogue? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  It will be difficult. But look, as I just mentioned, the panel yesterday included two Republicans, including a Trump appointee. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=299.88s)]
*  She surely knows that. Right. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=305.08s)]
*  And yet she's still going on air saying, well, OK, to be fair, maybe that information did not make its way to her. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=307.0s)]
*  But she should know that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=312.16s)]
*  And the other part of that sort of statement that I find kind of bizarre, to be honest, is the will of the American people. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=314.96s)]
*  I mean, these tariffs are wildly unpopular. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  Every poll that I have seen and there have been a bunch of them that come out in the last three, four or five weeks, it's like two thirds. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=324.2s)]
*  It's consistently two thirds of Americans disapprove of the tariff policy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=329.88s)]
*  So we're talking about the will of the people on an issue like this. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=333.2s)]
*  They are probably in line with the court for the most part. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=335.56s)]
*  Can I just real quick on this stupid from Caroline Levitt, I really don't I don't want us to gloss over this because this goes to the heart of the problem we have right now in the country. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  That's what I was going to say. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=351.0s)]
*  That rhetoric is baloney and she knows it and she knows it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=353.24s)]
*  I'm not even going to say what she should know. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=359.0s)]
*  She knows it, but she's performing for the guy behind the Resolute Desk who wants to hear this. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=360.59999999999997s)]
*  He needs that justification for the action he's taken. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  And when he gets pushed back, his response is, oh, you're the bad actor. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=371.56s)]
*  You're the one who's undermining this system. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=377.72s)]
*  He's the one who's undermining the system. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=380.6s)]
*  And I think we need to be clear about that and stop playing this game and taking the crap that comes out of this administration behind that podium every day, undermining our judicial system. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=382.68s)]
*  It is the last front we have against what they're doing. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=394.2s)]
*  And I think we just need to be clear about that and not sit back as we do in Washington and pity pat around the crazy because she's got the White House podium in front of her and the and the logo behind her. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=399.08s)]
*  That doesn't justify anything that we see happening right now. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU3Ysl4fZJY&t=411.64s)]
