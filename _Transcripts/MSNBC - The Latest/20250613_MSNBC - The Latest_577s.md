# Netanyahu to the Iranian people: We are clearing the path for your freedom
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg)
*  Joining us now we have former Israeli ambassador to the US Michael Aron [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=0.0s)]
*  Ambassador we just got a security alert coming out of the US embassy in Jordan saying the US embassy has indications [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=4.44s)]
*  There may be missiles drones or rockets flying over Jordanian airspace is urging American citizens to exercise [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=10.6s)]
*  Caution due to high tensions in the region, but I want to ask you about those high tensions in the region [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=16.56s)]
*  We saw the US State Department [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=22.66s)]
*  Quietly move a lot of people out of those the consulate in Erbil in Iraq and Baghdad because they knew this was coming and feared [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=24.56s)]
*  They risk to American personnel and forces if you were a diplomat in this region [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=32.72s)]
*  Would you be concerned and would you think about evacuating your embassy or would you wait? I? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=37.9s)]
*  Was certainly back with my family Christina not the embassy keep my I don't think Iran is targeting Jordan [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  I don't think Iran is gonna think many times before targeting Iraq certainly Saudi Arabia or other Gulf countries [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=49.4s)]
*  Because President Trump has made it abundantly clear [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=54.3s)]
*  That should Iran target any of its any of America's Arab allies in the region the United States will respond very robustly [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=57.14s)]
*  And what was happening in Jordan was there are rockets passing over Jordan from Iran on route to Israel and Jordan is saying it's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=64.74s)]
*  Intercepted some of those rockets not in defense of Israel, but in defense of its own airspace, which is fine by us [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=71.62s)]
*  Israel will continue to defend itself [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=78.25999999999999s)]
*  We have a the world's most advanced multi-layered air defense system, you know the Iron Dome system [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  That's for a rather low-flying local [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=84.9s)]
*  Rocket, but we also have David sling which is a medium-range rocket that can take down a cruise missile [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=87.98s)]
*  I think those are the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=92.7s)]
*  Interceptions you showed recently on your broadcast and we also have a suborbital and orbital [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=93.82000000000001s)]
*  Rockets developed with the United States called arrow 2 and arrow 3 because some of these rockets we run go actually go into outer space [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=99.38s)]
*  Before coming down and trying to hit Israel and no [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=105.42s)]
*  System no antiblastic system is perfect. No matter how multifaceted and advanced these systems are about 90 to 95 percent [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=109.06s)]
*  Effective in which is why you saw a hundred rockets being fired by Iran at Israel and apparently five to seven got through [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=116.38s)]
*  Which would be keeping with the with the usual percentage [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=122.86s)]
*  The last time Iran and Israel had this kind of exchange of fire [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=128.34s)]
*  It was tit-for-tat and then it kind of settled down [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=132.74s)]
*  Interlocutors from the US and regional allies were able to kind of put a lid on it because each side [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=135.9s)]
*  Felt like they had done enough for the optics of their own domestic populations to look like they had pushed back [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  I'm wondering if you think this will be a sufficient response from Iran or given how important the nuclear facility is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=146.66s)]
*  To the national identity to the Khamenei regime if you think they will have to do more than this and Israel should be expecting [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=153.54000000000002s)]
*  more retaliation from Tehran [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  I think we're entering into a very complex geo strategic [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=162.16s)]
*  Situation think of it multi-tiered chess [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=166.64s)]
*  The Trump administration has told the Iranians that that unless they come back to negotiating table and are willing to make significant concessions in those [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=169.88s)]
*  Negotiations then the United States will basically let Israel continue to hit Iran and hit Iran in a quote-unquote brutal way [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=177.48s)]
*  Israel will continue his battle and can do basically a rolling thunder type of strikes at Iran and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=184.88s)]
*  Iran then will retaliate now the first retaliation tonight of a hundred rockets fell short of the 300 rockets that were fired [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=190.84s)]
*  twice in in October and April of 2024 [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=198.68s)]
*  But Iran can engage Israel in a prolonged battle of attrition keeping our airport closed keeping us indoors [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=203.08s)]
*  My family's now in a bomb shelter [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=209.84s)]
*  We had bombs falling not so far from here not too long ago and sirens going off and that's a that's a war of attrition [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=211.56s)]
*  At the end of the day [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=218.72s)]
*  I think there's a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=219.92s)]
*  understanding among its early policymakers that this round this this fighting will not end in the battlefield but we're in the round of negotiating table and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=221.32s)]
*  Iran is the is now maneuvering by firing at Israel to try to improve its position in a negotiating table to renew negotiations with the United [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=229.32s)]
*  States [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=237.24s)]
*  And Israel will try to strengthen America's position [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  for example [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=241.56s)]
*  The United States has said that it wants to see the dismantling of Iranian nuclear facilities not just capping their enrichment potential [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=242.44s)]
*  Well, hopefully at the end of this round of fighting that Iran will be negotiating for the demand dismantlement of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=249.8s)]
*  Facilities that are already dismantled by the Israeli military, but I'm confident. I don't know what the price is [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=257.0s)]
*  I don't know how long this is going to take. I I'm pretty confident. It's not going to end tonight [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=262.24s)]
*  But it will end somewhere along the line around a negotiating table [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=266.32s)]
*  Ambassador I want to follow up with something you mentioned because you were talking about the circumstances under which you said quote the US will continue [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  to allow Israel to hit Iran [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm wondering if you think the US still has control over what? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=278.52000000000004s)]
*  Netanyahu what Israel does in the region because all the information we have is that the Trump administration didn't want this to go forward right now [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=283.8s)]
*  They wanted everybody at the table at Oman on Sunday [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=291.44s)]
*  This is counter to what the Trump White House really wanted in the region [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you think Trump has the power to hold Netanyahu back or have any influence on what he does? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=297.72s)]
*  What's important point? I want to make very clear [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=303.96s)]
*  I didn't say that the United States can control Israel, but Trump said the United States can control Israel [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=305.88s)]
*  In fact Israel acts in accordance to its own interest and the interests here were existential [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=310.12s)]
*  Israeli leaders believe that Iran was on the verge of creating a nuclear weapon that would have endangered Israel's future existence [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=315.2s)]
*  And I think a great number of Israelis would agree with that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=321.92s)]
*  And in the past going back to 1981 when Menachem Begin [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  defied the Ronald Reagan by attacking the Baghdad the Iraqi nuclear reactor and then in 2007 when [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=328.64000000000004s)]
*  Ehud Olmert the Israeli Prime Minister defied George Bush in attacking the Syrian nuclear reactor [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=334.76000000000005s)]
*  There have been several precedents that showed that when Israel has to act in its defense it will act [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=340.12s)]
*  independently of the United States or even in defiance of the United States [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=346.56s)]
*  But the end of the day the United States remains Israel's ultimate ally and as this war of attrition will grind on Israel will need [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  Read supply of munitions perhaps of jet fuel and so to a large extent is what we'll try to remain on the same page [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=356.56s)]
*  With the United States the big question tonight is the degree to which the United States will act to help defend Israel's skies now in those previous [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=363.24s)]
*  two [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  Incidents of firing in 2024 and as Courtney mentioned the United States was very active in taking down rockets [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=371.24s)]
*  The US Air Force was taking down drones [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  But also some missiles and the United States has three major systems in this area the Aegis system the Patriot system in the THAAD system [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=379.92s)]
*  Which joins our multi-level? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  Anti-malistic systems and they could be very effective again. Nothing. No system is [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=390.12s)]
*  Impenetrable is that is not is not full stuff is foolproof and rockets will get through but as Israel continues to pound [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=394.52000000000004s)]
*  Iranian positions including Iran the Iranian arsenals and missile launchers [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=402.68s)]
*  Iran's ability to strike Israel, I think will be impaired. Yeah, it reminds me of that old IRA saying you have to be lucky [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=407.36s)]
*  Every time I only have to be lucky once we do have a new statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=414.48s)]
*  He says he's addressing the Iranian people directly. I'm gonna read a little bit of it to you [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=421.44s)]
*  He says the Islamic regime which has oppressed you for almost 50 years [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=426.52000000000004s)]
*  Threatens to destroy our country the state of Israel the objective of Israel's operation is to thwart the Islamic regime's nuclear and ballistic [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=429.96s)]
*  Missile threat to us as we achieve our objective [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=437.34s)]
*  We are also clearing a path for you to achieve your freedom and he goes on to say as I said yesterday and many times before [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=440.32s)]
*  Israel's fight is not against the Iranian people [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=447.47999999999996s)]
*  It seems to be a call for the Iranian people to stand up and at the end of it [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=449.91999999999996s)]
*  He says the time has come for standing up for your freedom from the evil and oppressive regime [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=455.18s)]
*  Do you think this is likely to get any traction inside Iran? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=460.5s)]
*  I mean often when countries are hit even if they have internal political tensions [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=464.53999999999996s)]
*  It sends to force people together towards solidarity towards nationalism not necessarily towards regime change [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=469.46s)]
*  But what's your take here? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=476.14s)]
*  Well, this is not the first time the Prime Minister has made the statements like this. It's going back several years [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=478.46s)]
*  He's called the sense of the Iranian people months and months ago that your your freedom is coming. Hold on and [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=482.18s)]
*  Israel is aware as I think the Iranian regime is aware that it has a tremendous amount of internal opposition. There have been large-scale [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=489.06s)]
*  Demonstrations against the regime most recently by Iranian women that was brutally suppressed [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=496.46000000000004s)]
*  And it's not a popular government at all. It's extremely unpopular government [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=501.22s)]
*  So this figures into that geo strategic situation that was talking about earlier [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=505.02s)]
*  The Iranians may want to continue to fight but the longer they continue to fight longer Israel continues to battle Iran then [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=508.98s)]
*  Domestic opposition to the regime could mount and there has been a debate and I've been part of that debate [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=514.62s)]
*  Whether a military strike against Iran would as you mentioned [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=520.46s)]
*  Cause Iranian people to rally around the regime rather than take advantage of the regime's weakness [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=524.66s)]
*  And I must say that in that debate a second school that says no the Iranian people are so fed up with this regime that they [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=529.98s)]
*  Perceive that the regime has been weakened that it's not just a paper tiger. It's a tissue tiger [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=535.66s)]
*  Then you can see large scale opposition in the streets [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=540.98s)]
*  And I think the Iranian is going to take that into account and it's calculus of how long doesn't go on before they will [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=543.9399999999999s)]
*  Signal to the United States uncle we are willing to go back to those the negotiating table. Just tell the Israelis to hold off [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=550.02s)]
*  You [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4TUzt9JOg&t=565.66s)]
