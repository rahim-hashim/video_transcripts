# 'BE PATIENT!!!': Trump downplays tariff turmoil despite U.S. economy shrinking in Q1
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ)
*  Economic alarm bells are going off this morning. The latest GDP report shows the US economy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=0.0s)]
*  shrank in the first three months of the year, contracting by 0.3 percent. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=6.16s)]
*  We haven't seen a contraction since the pandemic. Now, keep in mind, this is a snapshot of the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  economy before Trump's tariff rollout this month. And those tariffs were already causing major [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  industries to sound the alarm about a potential downturn, driving a dip in public support for the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=21.44s)]
*  president's economic agenda. And as you can see, the stock market reacting this morning already in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=27.04s)]
*  negative territory. With all this pressure mounting next hour, Trump hosts another cabinet meeting [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=32.08s)]
*  following last night's campaign-style rally in Michigan to mark his 100th day in office, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=37.36s)]
*  full of his usual barrage of grand claims and grievances. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=42.64s)]
*  I hope for the sake of our country that the Supreme Court is going to save this because [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=48.56s)]
*  we have to do something. These people are just looking to destroy our country. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=54.24s)]
*  Nothing will stop me and the mission to keep America safe again. It's very simple. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=59.28s)]
*  After a lifetime of unelected bureaucrats stealing your paychecks, attacking your values, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=65.68s)]
*  and trampling your freedoms, we are stopping their gravy train. We cannot allow a handful [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=71.12s)]
*  of communist radical-left judges to obstruct the enforcement of our laws. You're not supposed to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=76.72s)]
*  criticize the Fed. You're supposed to let him do his own thing. But I know much more than he does [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=81.68s)]
*  about interest rates. They're signing left and right because of my taxation and tariff policies, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=85.84s)]
*  which are policies of common sense and genius. We are covering every angle this morning with NBC [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  News senior White House correspondent Gabe Gutierrez, NBC News senior business correspondent [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  Christine Romans, Republican strategist and MSNBC political analyst Susan DelPercio, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=103.28s)]
*  and New York Times chief White House correspondent and MSNBC political analyst Peter Baker. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=108.16s)]
*  Christine, GDP shrank in the first quarter of this year. What is the significance of that, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  and how does that impact everyday America? It's the first time the economy didn't grow [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=119.52s)]
*  since the pandemic. That is remarkable for its timing. It was growing strongly at the end of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=123.6s)]
*  last year. This is hitting the brakes on the American economy. When you look in the formula [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=128.48s)]
*  that you use to figure out gross domestic product, all of these imports ahead of his tariffs, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=134.0s)]
*  record amounts of imports in some categories coming in here as people were stockpiling ahead [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=141.2s)]
*  of tariffs, that distorted this number. And so that's why it's so negative. You also had [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=145.28s)]
*  government spending fall because of Doge and they're cutting government spending. And remember, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=149.44s)]
*  this is a rear view mirror picture. This is the first three months of the year. So this is before [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=153.68s)]
*  the biggest of the Trump tariffs started to bite. So does that mean it could get even worse? It [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  could, or it could bounce back. We really don't know what's going to happen. I mean, this trade [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=162.56s)]
*  policy is so upsetting of the apple cart. You know, it's unclear what's going to happen next. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=166.8s)]
*  We did see a private sector payroll number today that was very, very weak. There's a government [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=173.2s)]
*  jobs number on Friday. Every one of these numbers we're going to be parsing to see just what are the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=178.48s)]
*  effects on the economy of this very big, different trade change from the president. Gabe, how is the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=183.28s)]
*  White House framing this economic news? Well, hi, there on it. Well, the Trump administration [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=189.2s)]
*  has repeatedly tried to look backwards in many ways when the stock market is not as high as they [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=194.72s)]
*  would like it to be. They've been blaming the Biden administration for leaving them with [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=201.76s)]
*  poor economic conditions, even though inflation had already started to cool. Now, just a few [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  moments ago, President Trump posting on social media that quote, this is Biden's stock market, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  not Trump's. I didn't take over until January 20th. Tariffs will soon start kicking in and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=217.28s)]
*  companies are starting to move into the U.S. And then further down, this will take a while. This [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=221.52s)]
*  has nothing to do with tariffs, only that he left us with bad numbers. Be patient, he tells his [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=225.12s)]
*  supporters. However, if you look to January of 2024, the president posted on social media that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=230.96s)]
*  this is the Trump stock market because my polls against Biden are so good. So again, that makes [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=238.08s)]
*  the point that the president has a long history of taking credit for the stock market when it is up [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=243.44s)]
*  and trying to deflect blame for it when it's lower than he'd like. OK, so Gabe just did the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=249.44s)]
*  fact check there for us. Susan, can Trump really get away with saying this isn't my economy, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=256.16s)]
*  this has nothing to do with my tariffs? Well, Trump's been very good at getting away with those [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=262.88s)]
*  statements for eight years now. But the difference is now, Anna, for four years before he took the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=268.64s)]
*  presidency back, he was able to say anything without accountability. He wasn't president. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  Now as president, people will hold him accountable. His words matter more, whether it's to CEOs [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=280.72s)]
*  or people just planning their mom and pop stores, like if they have to worry about what's coming [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  into the country and tariffs. So his words matter more and people will hold him accountable. As [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=292.0s)]
*  we've seen, frankly, in a whole spate of different polling recently. And Christine, bottom line, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=297.36s)]
*  this is his economy, no? Yeah, I mean, he says he wants to remake it and this is what happens when [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=302.48s)]
*  you want to remake it. I mean, it's remarkable, the collapse in container traffic coming from [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  China to the United States. These are the two world's biggest economies that will have ripple [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=314.16s)]
*  effects. I've been doing, you know, checks of freight companies and trucking companies and the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=318.56s)]
*  layoffs have already started to have already begun there. And you've got a lot of small companies, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=324.4s)]
*  especially small retailers, independent retailers who are not ordering for back to school and not [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  ordering for the fall season. And they don't know if they'll be in business for Christmas. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=333.28s)]
*  Those are main street jobs with all kinds of other attendant jobs that go with them. So there's a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=336.96s)]
*  lot of economic activity that we're going to see how this plays out. And the president has [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  determined that tariffs are a good thing and he is going to remake sort of this balance of global [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  trade. He was talking a lot about the tariffs last night at that rally. He's about to sit down [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=352.48s)]
*  next hour with his cabinet. This is day 101, Gabe. How does this news impact their agenda? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=357.44s)]
*  Well, look, a lot of what we'll be focusing on during this cabinet meeting in the next hour or [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=364.0s)]
*  so is whether Elon Musk will be there. Of course, Elon Musk heading up Doge, his time within the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  government is supposedly coming to an end. Chief of Staff Suzy Wiles in an interview with the New [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=376.88s)]
*  York Post that was published yesterday said that Elon Musk is no longer regularly working physically [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  inside the White House, that he's been doing some of his work from by phone. So it is unclear right [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  now whether he will be at this cabinet meeting today, but that's something we'll be watching. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=394.0s)]
*  We're also hoping to get more information on this discussion of trade deals with other countries [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=397.84s)]
*  who've been hearing different accounts of the last several days about how far along they are. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=404.0s)]
*  Several Trump administration officials saying they may be close to a deal with India, perhaps Japan. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=409.36s)]
*  So that's something that we hope to learn more about as the day progresses and as we're getting [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=415.04s)]
*  this new economic news that you just referenced. Gabe, thanks so much. Keep us posted. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=420.08s)]
*  Peter, what are you hearing about Trump's mindset as he is exiting the honeymoon phase of his [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=425.2s)]
*  final term in office? Are the economic realities starting to sink in? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=431.04s)]
*  Well, look, I think he is counseling patients, which I think is a particularly unusual advice [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  from the most impatient person we can think of, right? This is a man who lives very short term, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=442.72s)]
*  lives, as my colleague Maggie Havenman once put it, from five minutes to five minutes. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  And now he's trying to tell the country, yeah, okay, there's some short term pain here, but we're [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  going to get to this golden age that he promised in the inauguration. And the question is whether [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=455.76s)]
*  or not the country is willing to go along with that. The country, you know, elected him with the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=460.24s)]
*  idea that he was a master steward of the economy, that he was going to make prices go down. That [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=466.08s)]
*  obviously hasn't happened. I think the people thought that when he came in, the economy would [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=472.48s)]
*  get better, not worse for a while. He certainly didn't prepare the ground for this idea that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=477.04s)]
*  the transition to this non-globalized version of the economy that he has in mind would involve any [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=482.0s)]
*  kind of adjustment period. So he didn't lay that groundwork. A lot of Americans might be surprised [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=488.72s)]
*  at what's happened so far. And the question is how long this current turmoil continues. If it's [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=494.8s)]
*  sustained, it becomes, I think, a bigger problem for him. If it's short term, if he manages to kind [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=499.20000000000005s)]
*  of pull back and create some trade deals that he calls a victory and everything kind of returns [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  to some sort of stable situation, he'll probably be okay. We know in the past, at least, trade deals [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=508.8s)]
*  can take a long time. And we have seen in latest polling at least high prices are very much top of [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=514.24s)]
*  mind for voters. Here's what President Trump said on ABC when he was asked if his tariffs will raise [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=521.92s)]
*  prices and make this worse. Hard times? Hard times are ahead? I don't think so. I think great [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=528.4s)]
*  times are ahead. Look, since I came in, gasoline is down, groceries are down, egg prices are down, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  many things are down, just about everything. Quick fact check here. Since Trump took office, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=543.2s)]
*  gas prices, grocery prices, egg prices, look at this, they are all up. In fact, eggs are at a [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=550.8s)]
*  record high for the consumer. Susan, we have seen this over and over again with Trump as a candidate, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=556.72s)]
*  as president before, as president now, where he says the same thing over and over and over again [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=563.04s)]
*  repeatedly, in effect, trying to get his supporters to believe it's true that it is now their reality. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=567.12s)]
*  Do you see it working this time? I don't. And here's one reason why. Because now Americans are [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=575.2s)]
*  going to the supermarket and they're putting their groceries on credit card. They are accumulating [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=580.32s)]
*  credit card debt, which will cost them more because they can't afford the groceries at the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=585.28s)]
*  store. So people know what the prices are. They can't escape the reality. You can't escape that reality. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=591.44s)]
*  Perhaps, I'm not of this camp, but there is a camp that said that Trump's tariff plans could work out, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=597.12s)]
*  but it's a five to 10-year proposition. Now, China can hold on maybe for five to 10 years because they [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=604.32s)]
*  don't care about what they do to their public and the public can't rise up. Americans are not going [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4RIUjqLbQ&t=610.08s)]
