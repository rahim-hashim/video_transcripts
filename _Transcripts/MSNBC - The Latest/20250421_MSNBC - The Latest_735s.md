# ‘Heartbroken’: Faithful around the world mourn the death of Pope Francis
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg)
*  Good day. I'm Chris Jansing live at MSNBC headquarters in New York City and we begin [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=0.0s)]
*  with the death of Pope Francis, the 88 year old Pontiff passing away early this morning, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=8.88s)]
*  just hours after delivering a plea for peace and human kindness. That Easter message turned out to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=14.16s)]
*  be his last. These are live pictures from St. Peter's Square. It is seven o'clock at night. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=20.72s)]
*  It was just yesterday there that the pope electrified a crowd wishing the nearly 1.4 [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=27.2s)]
*  billion Catholics worldwide his quote brothers and sisters a happy Easter. Those cheers now [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  replaced by hushed tones of prayer and mourning. While he had been hospitalized for more than five [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=39.84s)]
*  weeks recently, there had also been hope, particularly after his appearance yesterday on [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=46.4s)]
*  Easter that the pope may have been on the road to recovery from a near fatal case of pneumonia, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=51.76s)]
*  but it was not to be today mourners immediately streaming into St. Peter's Square where we heard [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=57.36s)]
*  the bells toll in Pope Francis's memory. We have learned that the Vatican will lead a rosary there [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=62.56s)]
*  in St. Peter's Square just minutes from now and next hour the pope's chamberlain, Cardinal Kevin [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=77.76s)]
*  Farrell, the same man who announced the pope's death this morning, will certify his passing [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=83.36s)]
*  and oversee the placing of his body into his coffin. On Wednesday the pope's body will be [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  moved to St. Peter's Basilica where he will lie in state ahead of his funeral. Christopher White [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=93.12s)]
*  is Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter and an MSNBC contributor. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=98.48s)]
*  Deborah Luboff is an MSNBC Vatican analyst and contributor who is joining us from Vatican City. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=103.44s)]
*  I know you are on the roof Deborah overlooking St. Peter's Square, but have you been able to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=110.0s)]
*  talk to some of the faithful there and what are you hearing and what are you feeling out on the square? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=116.0s)]
*  Certainly around St. Peter's Square what we hear are many faithful who have expressed they are [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=123.84s)]
*  heartbroken because they really loved Pope Francis and they really had wished and thought [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=128.32s)]
*  that having seen various positive signs since he was discharged from the hospital that he was [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=133.84s)]
*  rebounding like he's always done. Certainly this time had been more serious in the hospital with [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  the pneumonia, but he hadn't been on his oxygen and he had been showing signs of hope with some [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=145.6s)]
*  of his public appearances yesterday in St. Peter's Square, Easter Sunday, his blessing the crowd, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=153.04s)]
*  his blessing the baby circling through the crowd, the unexpected surprise made so many just feel [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=159.84s)]
*  such a sense of delight, but today they are heartbroken. Chris, we know that this was a pope [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=166.32s)]
*  that was beloved by many. He among Catholics, they do the kind of polls we do for American [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=175.04s)]
*  presidents here. A vast majority of Catholics felt favorably about this pope. Explain the loss as [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=182.56s)]
*  you've talked to people and I know you've been on the ground over the last 24 hours or so, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=190.0s)]
*  but also what we're hearing from Vatican officials. I think it's fair to say that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=194.16s)]
*  Pope Francis had approval ratings that any American politician would kill for [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=199.2s)]
*  and that certainly felt here. Both yesterday being in St. Peter's Square, you could just [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=204.0s)]
*  sense the joy of so many people who weren't quite sure if Pope Francis was going to be able to make [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=208.56s)]
*  it to then sort of see him come out on the balcony and give the Easter blessing and then go out on [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=213.6s)]
*  the Pope mobile. I think it shocked a lot of people. At the same time, you know, it's fair to say that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=218.8s)]
*  Pope, you know, while he was making an effort to connect with young children yesterday and greet and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=222.88s)]
*  bless people, he also looked at times disoriented and really to be suffering. And last night I spoke [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=228.32s)]
*  with a senior Vatican official who said, you know, he's had good days and bad days since [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=234.64s)]
*  recovering and today was one of his worst days. I think that was a sense that, you know, he was [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=238.64s)]
*  going to push through and that he was going to ultimately recover. So I think today's death comes [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=244.16s)]
*  to the shock to even those who had been close to the pope in his final days. Yeah, and Chris, of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=249.2s)]
*  course, everyone knew that the pope was sick. His doctors reportedly told him to stay isolated in his [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=253.76s)]
*  Vatican residence to get better. He did not do that. He did greet the faithful at St. Peter's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=258.64s)]
*  Square on Palm Sunday. He visited a prison last Thursday. He was at St. Peter's Basilica on [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=263.68s)]
*  Saturday. We saw the Easter message yesterday. The New York Times put it this way, Chris. He said, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=269.44s)]
*  it said, looking back, those seem like farewell gestures. It's like he was powering through for [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=275.52s)]
*  Easter. Is that how you see it? I do. I think that's fair. I mean, if we go back to 2013 when [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=281.76s)]
*  Pope Francis was elected, I mean, he came in as a maverick who he shocked the Catholic church by, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=287.44s)]
*  you know, doing away with all the formal vestments and not living in the apostolic palace. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=293.52s)]
*  And he went out as a maverick. He bucked his doctor's orders to stay at home and rest for two [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=298.8s)]
*  months. He wanted to be close to the people. I think, I think he has, you know, to the very end, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=303.52s)]
*  he had a pastor's heart and he didn't want anyone to separate him from being with his people. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=308.08s)]
*  And so, yes, perhaps he was well aware that his time was short and he was going to go out in his [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=313.28s)]
*  own way. And Deborah, I know you wrote a couple of days ago about the Pope's recent appearances [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  in public calling him, quote, the Pope of surprises. And he did seem to surprise a lot of people just by [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=323.68s)]
*  fighting through what doctors said were two near death experiences when he was hospitalized. And [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=330.64s)]
*  here's what one woman had to say about it. It's just very sad day. It's honestly, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=336.32s)]
*  I think, impressive that he made it to Easter. I think that's almost like a miracle for Italy. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=345.28s)]
*  She used the word miracle that somehow he willed or prayed himself into making it until Easter, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=351.44s)]
*  which of course is the Christian day of resurrection and allowed him that final Easter message. Fair to [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=357.12s)]
*  say that he lived as he died as he lived, I guess, defying expectations. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=364.0s)]
*  Right. Indeed. I certainly agree with that. And I think it defied what people were expecting, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=371.92s)]
*  because if you remember this week, he also held his largest group meeting with physicians and staff [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=378.0s)]
*  and representatives associated with Rome's Jamelli Hospital, including his surgeons. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=385.84s)]
*  One of the individuals speaking had even said, Holy Father, we hope that you come back to Jamelli, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=390.64s)]
*  but not as a patient, because so many were really not just rooting for him, but objectively, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  scientifically seemed like certain things were really moving in the right direction, even though [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  his frailty was obviously rather visible. But every other time he has rebounded. And I think [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=407.76s)]
*  it was certainly a surprising for many people. If you remember with John Paul II, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=414.56s)]
*  when he had passed away, that was actually right after Easter and Holy Week as well. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=421.44s)]
*  So there does seem to be something in the universe that makes this moment in the liturgical year [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=426.32s)]
*  kind of poetic from this point of view. But regardless, it doesn't change [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=432.88s)]
*  the sadness that people feel. But at the same time, everyone, I think, has been very grateful [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  for the fact that Pope Francis has been able to defy odds so many times throughout the pandemic, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=442.24s)]
*  and not throughout the pandemic, but throughout the pontificate. After he had various bouts of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=447.52s)]
*  hospitalizations, et cetera, he bounced back and he had made appeals for the wars that would—the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=451.92s)]
*  war in Ukraine and the Holy Land. He would become the pope of the pandemic. He managed to make that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=458.56s)]
*  whirlwind papal travel to Asia and Oceania and go to Mongolia, et cetera. So he's just every single [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=462.88s)]
*  time kind of had these miracles, as you had said. But now those miracles are [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=470.08s)]
*  going to have to be happening from above. And Chris, the last active pope to die was, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=477.2s)]
*  of course, John Paul, because Benedict had long been retired when he died. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=482.56s)]
*  The outpouring back then for John Paul was extraordinary and estimated, I think, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=487.12s)]
*  four million people from all over the world poured into Rome. And in spite of lines for St. Peter's [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=491.12s)]
*  that went on for a mile or more, it was, and I was there, remarkable and remarkably well organized. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=496.24s)]
*  Are you seeing any signs or hearing of any signs of preparations for the influx of pilgrims who are [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=503.12s)]
*  certainly going to come to Rome to say their goodbyes? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=509.04s)]
*  This is a Jubilee year in Rome, which means that Rome is already expecting a surge of tourists. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=513.52s)]
*  And I think it's equipped to handle them for the Jubilee, so I think they'll be equipped to [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=518.96s)]
*  handle them for a papal funeral. And of course, we'll have high level security. I mean, we've had [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=523.76s)]
*  the likes of Viktor Orban and Putin praising Pope Francis today and also Barack Obama and Joe Biden [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  and Donald Trump. So we can expect many heads of state. I think this will be a closely watched [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=534.16s)]
*  event where the eyes of the world will really be on Rome in the coming weeks. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=539.2s)]
*  I want to bring in NBC's Erin McLaughlin at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. And Erin, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=543.12s)]
*  I know that people around the world are marking the death of Pope Francis and people have been [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=549.12s)]
*  streaming into St. Patrick's Cathedral all day long. What are you seeing and hearing in New York? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=554.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, Chris, the Archbishop of New York, Cardinal Dolan, released a statement earlier [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=562.48s)]
*  today making the point that people around the world, people of all faiths, people of no faith [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=567.36s)]
*  are mourning the loss of Pope Francis. And that's very much reflected in some of the conversations [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=572.8s)]
*  that I've been having with folks here outside St. Patrick's Cathedral. People around the world [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=577.6s)]
*  telling me that he will be remembered as a man of kindness, a man of peace. Take a listen. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=582.88s)]
*  What do you think he means to the world? The world? I think it's just this one word, kindness. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=590.08s)]
*  Good heart. Kindness and like peace, inner peace. I like his compassion. I liked what he stood for. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  Understood what he was trying to practice and what he was trying to preach. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=604.88s)]
*  And not being a religious person, it's just the fact that when you have a decent human being, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=609.28s)]
*  they deserve recognition. New Yorkers will remember his visit to New York City back in 2015. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=614.16s)]
*  Thousands lined this street as he pulled up in the Pope Mobile to St. Patrick's Cathedral behind [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=622.4799999999999s)]
*  me. You can see today the funeral bunting there over the main entrance, purple and black, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=628.4000000000001s)]
*  symbols of mourning within the Catholic faith. And then inside the cathedral prominently displayed [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=634.4000000000001s)]
*  a portrait of Pope Francis amidst the Easter flowers there on the main altar. We understand [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=640.24s)]
*  that the New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced that all flags will fly at half staff [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=645.9200000000001s)]
*  in the Pope's memory. And there'll be a special service to remember Pope Francis here at St. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=650.32s)]
*  Patrick's Cathedral tomorrow. Chris. Thank you for that. So Deborah, there are masses, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=655.44s)]
*  there are memorials being held worldwide from Bethlehem to Moscow to South America, Southeast [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=660.5600000000001s)]
*  Asia to remember the man who earned the nickname the People's Pope. There is though already debate [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ocVjVhSJWg&t=666.0s)]
