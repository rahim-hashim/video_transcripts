# Rahm Emanuel teases 2028 run, attempts to pull Democrats to the center
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g)
*  Bring in Charlie Sykes, an MSNBC contributor and columnist. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining me here in studio, Adrian Elrod, former senior advisor and senior spokesperson for the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=3.6s)]
*  Harris Walls campaign who worked for Rahm Emanuel at the DNC. Okay, so Adrian, Emanuel was on the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=8.4s)]
*  view a couple weeks ago. He was kind of teasing a presidential run. Let's play that. I think one of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  the problems for Democrats, we allow Donald Trump to get too much in our head. We got to make sure, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=21.76s)]
*  I do we have an answer to the question, what is troubling and challenging the American people? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  And we have to start focusing on those answers, not just being against Trump, but for America. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=32.64s)]
*  And they got to have somebody with the muscle and the fight ready to make that. You sound like a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=38.24s)]
*  presidential candidate. Look, well, I am in training. I don't know if I'll make the Olympics. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=42.32s)]
*  He's been in training for a while. Indeed. And you know him, as I said, from the DNC. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=48.56s)]
*  Pros and cons. He's going to be in a crowded field if he enters the presidential race. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=53.84s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think, Chris, there are a lot of pros to this. First of all, you've got to look at [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  Rahm's track record as an aide to President Clinton. He tackled some of the toughest challenges [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=61.52s)]
*  at that time and got them through passing the assault weapons ban, enacting children's health [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  insurance. Same with President Obama as his chief of staff, you know, passed the Affordable Care Act, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=71.84s)]
*  dealt with the financial crisis in a very effective way. Okay. It's a whole different world. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=77.36s)]
*  I understand that. But the point is, I think it's important when Democrats are looking, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=81.6s)]
*  and not just Democrats, but people in America are looking for their next leader. They want to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=85.36s)]
*  have somebody who has a proven track record. Rahm, of course, a lot of success as mayor of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  Chicago as well, but also somebody who has a forward-looking vision. That is incredibly [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=93.52s)]
*  important. And I think the points that Rahm has been making are points that a lot of Democrats [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  have been wanting to hear, which is we are too woke in our party. We need to get back to that sort [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=102.56s)]
*  of moderate Democratic leadership committee centrist viewpoint. If we're actually going to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=108.08s)]
*  pull in more people into our party, pull in more people into our coalition, we've got to get back [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=113.84s)]
*  to talking about the issues that really affect American families. And he's exactly right. I mean, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=118.0s)]
*  I think sometimes, and I've seen this happen a lot in the House and Senate right now too, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=121.92s)]
*  where Democrats tend to sort of chase the Trump of tail. Whatever Trump's saying and doing, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=126.0s)]
*  they chase that as opposed to really forward, looking at a forward-looking vision. And I think [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=131.2s)]
*  Rahm is somebody that a lot of us look at as someone who we'd like to see more back in action, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=136.16s)]
*  whether that means he's a presidential candidate, whether it means he's running for [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  another public office. We want to see him out there more because we need that tough talking [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=145.04s)]
*  leadership. So, Charlie, Emanuel does seem to be trying to push the Democratic party to the center [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=148.32s)]
*  when you say things like toxic, weak and woke. So in the age of Trump, might the country, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=152.64s)]
*  as Adrienne suggests, be looking for a candidate who is more centrist but also has a reputation [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=158.16s)]
*  of being blunt, outspoken and aggressive? I mean, his nickname is Rambo after all. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=163.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's safe to say that he is very, very much a dark horse when we're talking [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=170.0s)]
*  about the presidential race. But he's entering a debate that Democrats are going to be having now [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  for the next several years. What is their direction? What is their message? Why have they [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  been losing these elections? Why is their brand so underwater? And the fact that he's willing to say [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=183.76s)]
*  things like weak and woke, those are fighting words. That is a provocative entry into the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=189.36s)]
*  debate. So clearly, he is saying, we need somebody who is simply not going to engage in fan service [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=196.72000000000003s)]
*  for people on Blue Sky or viewers of MSNBC. We have to go to those voters who used to vote for [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  Democrats who aren't anymore. And so I think that it's important to mix this up. It's important to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=209.52s)]
*  hear from voices like this, whether or not he runs for president or he ends up running for [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=215.36s)]
*  governor of Illinois. That's a secondary question. But it's intriguing and it's intriguing [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  that he is so blunt at this point in the cycle. You know, Adrienne, it's occurring to me as I'm [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=228.0s)]
*  listening to Charlie that after last fall's electoral loss, a lot of Democrats wanted to see [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  the party ditch consultants. I say this to somebody who is a consultant. But one of the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=239.36s)]
*  things, there's a through line, I think, in a lot of successful presidents. Bill Clinton had great [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=245.28s)]
*  political instincts. When you talk to Bill Clinton, there was nobody else in the world, right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=250.96s)]
*  Barack Obama had a gut that he trusted and that he followed. Donald Trump trusts himself in front [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=255.36s)]
*  of an audience and knows how to deliver what his folks, his supporters, his base want to hear. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=263.36s)]
*  Is that what maybe has been missing? I wonder how, would anybody want to work for somebody who [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=272.88s)]
*  believes that he can run the campaign better than they can? But is that something that the Democrats [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=280.32s)]
*  have to look for? Whether it's Rahm or somebody else, they need somebody who can read the room [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  a little better than we've seen. Absolutely, Chris. I think what you just laid out with [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=289.76s)]
*  Clinton, Obama, even Trump to an extent. Not to an extent. This is a guy who can really- [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  People want authenticity. They don't want the talking points. They actually want someone who [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=301.2s)]
*  is going out there and speaking from their gut. And sometimes that is, you know, when you hear [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=304.88s)]
*  Donald Trump talk a lot, I don't agree with his rhetoric, but I do think that he is connected [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=309.52s)]
*  with the voters because he speaks to them in a very authentic way, especially to his base. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  And there is something to be said about doing that. You know, not going off-cand talking points [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=317.84s)]
*  and really going out there and having these direct conversations with the American people. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, one of the challenges, again, that we have as Democrats, and a lot of this has to do, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=327.11999999999995s)]
*  Chris, with the fact that we don't have a quote-unquote referee really out there right now [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=330.64s)]
*  who is, you know, definitely the leader of the party. And we haven't been in this situation a [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=334.4s)]
*  while. We don't have somebody who's really traffic-copping what the future is going to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=337.84s)]
*  look like and what we should be doing on the outside, which creates an opportunity for people [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=341.52s)]
*  who are interested in running for president, who are starting to kind of put their feelers out there. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=345.76s)]
*  But at the same time, it's a challenge in the sense that we don't know who that party leader [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=349.76s)]
*  is going to be. It's kind of where we were when Dukakis lost in 88, before Clinton became, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=353.2s)]
*  you know, the heir apparent and then led the party for eight years, and then even more so [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  afterwards because Gore lost and then John Kerry lost. So he really did sort of run the party up [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=361.28s)]
*  until Barack Obama became the president. We don't have somebody like that on the outside right now, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=366.96s)]
*  and that's one of the challenges that certainly creates a lot of opportunities for people like [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  Rahm, other people who may be exploring a run for president. Well, I would be very interested [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=375.28s)]
*  in watching a debate between Rahm Emanuel, Gretchen Whitmer, Gavin Newsom, Tim Walsh. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=380.23999999999995s)]
*  Sign me up. Charlie Sykes, Adrienne Elrod. Thank you both. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3CrNRy37g&t=385.28s)]
