# 'Forgot how to talk to normal people': Dem strategist on why party lost working class voters
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4)
*  The midterms fast approaching and the full six months after November's electoral drubbing the Democratic Party appears to still be in fact [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=0.0s)]
*  Finding mode the New York Times reports that party donors and strategists have been gathering at luxury [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=7.96s)]
*  hotels to discuss how to win back working-class voters and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=13.76s)]
*  They're spending 20 million dollars on an effort to try to figure out how to speak to young men quote [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=18.04s)]
*  It is code named Sam short for speaking with American men a strategic plan [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=23.6s)]
*  Promises investment to study the syntax language and content that gains attention and virality in these spaces. I [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=30.24s)]
*  Want to bring in Megan Hayes a former special assistant to President Biden and Basil Michael is back with whack with me. You're both smiling [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=38.16s)]
*  Donors and strategists Megan have been gathering at luxury hotels to discuss how to win back [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=46.04s)]
*  working-class voters [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=52.28s)]
*  The time says these news projects can read like anthropological studies of people from faraway places [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=55.0s)]
*  What do you see in here? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, it's great that we're being a little bit more introspective that's always helpful [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=64.52s)]
*  But I think that the Democrats have forgot that maybe we should just talk to people like people [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=68.1s)]
*  We don't need to do studies on it. We don't need to meet at hotels [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=71.92s)]
*  How about we just go to community meetings and meet people where they are on social media and their different forms and platforms that they [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=74.56s)]
*  Are but I think that we just the Democrats have forgot how to talk to normal people about things that are really important to them [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=80.22s)]
*  Like the economy [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=85.38s)]
*  So it's it's I think a really good lesson to learn but I also think we just need to get back to basics [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=86.86s)]
*  Yeah, I think Basil another very [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=92.36s)]
*  Informative little phrase and you're the academic here, but when you're trying to figure out the syntax language and content [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  Are you getting ahead? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=104.14s)]
*  Yeah, no, you're not [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=105.94s)]
*  This is not I [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=108.14s)]
*  Really have no understanding what that is because honestly if somebody needed to come talk to me just come talk to me [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=110.14s)]
*  Actually go find me and come and talk to me. Don't do it in a hotel [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=115.25999999999999s)]
*  Don't study me like this is some academic exercise [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=119.46s)]
*  That is exactly why we're not winning because we we because Democrats have been accused of looking and sounding too elitist [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=122.72s)]
*  That's a problem [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=130.38s)]
*  And the truth look the reality is yeah [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=131.98s)]
*  You know what strikes me because if you talk to some of these folks and I can just tell you anecdotally [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=134.5s)]
*  But you know, obviously there are lots of people doing focus groups on this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  But these folks don't like Donald Trump [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=144.94s)]
*  They don't want to vote for Donald Trump and most of them won't vote for Donald Trump [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=147.70000000000002s)]
*  But they don't have a darn good thing to say about the other side. Yeah, what do you do? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=152.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, when when don't you start out ahead if they really dislike the other guys? Well, you know, here's a here's a good example [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=156.9s)]
*  We spent there's been a lot of conversation about [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=163.7s)]
*  What people knew about Joe Biden and when did they know it to Megan's point if you actually go into communities and talk to voters [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=166.94s)]
*  They're not asking about Joe Biden. They're asking what do we do now? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=173.42s)]
*  Yeah, and if we don't have an if Democrats don't have an answer for that question, they're gonna continue to lose support [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=176.82s)]
*  Find answers go into communities actually amplify what? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  neighborhood organizations [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=187.7s)]
*  We talked in the last segment about violence disruptors talk to those folks because they're in these streets [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=189.22s)]
*  there are really good examples of how [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  people have [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=198.02s)]
*  Taught each other [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=199.18s)]
*  Ministered to each other clothed and fed each other because particularly in the African American community [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  We've always done that so amplify those stories [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=205.22s)]
*  But instead, you know, we're held up at hotels talking to each other [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=208.18s)]
*  Megan the Times also writes that Democrats have led indeed focus groups where voters are asked to name an [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=211.54000000000002s)]
*  Animal that best describes the Democratic Party one man said a deer in headlights [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=217.46s)]
*  You stand there and you see the car coming, but you're going to stand there and get hit with it. Anyway [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=222.26s)]
*  Changing perception obviously it's not a one-month thing. It's not even a one-year job [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=228.54s)]
*  But what can Democrats do because midterms will be here before they know it? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=232.82s)]
*  Right. I mean with the Democrats and get into this place of one election cycle. It wasn't just 2024 [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=238.5s)]
*  This has been going on for many years [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  So I think it's going to take the Democrats time [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=244.62s)]
*  But I do think that the that Congress was very aligned on their messaging with the the bill that was passed in the house [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=246.58s)]
*  And I think that they are very aligned and they're out there and talking to their communities and their constituents [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=252.42000000000002s)]
*  And I think they need to be aligned on that and continue to stay aligned on they care about the economy [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=256.14s)]
*  They care about keeping 14 million people with their health insurance and the 18 million kids keep getting food [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=259.98s)]
*  And I think that that those are the things that the Democrats are aligned on [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=265.42s)]
*  I think they need to continue to stay aligned on what's important to the American people and what's important to the moderates and that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=268.74s)]
*  Is the economy it's the cost of housing the cost of education the cost of groceries [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=273.5s)]
*  Those are the things that impact everyday people and you know, you're totally right [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=277.5s)]
*  No one is talking about Joe Biden and who knew what when they're talking about how much it is to pay for groceries and how? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=281.26s)]
*  They're gonna get their kids to school every day [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=286.3s)]
*  So it's just we need to be more aligned of with where people are who are actually voting and not what the DC bubble is [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=288.22s)]
*  You [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7S_SnW3O4&t=303.5s)]
