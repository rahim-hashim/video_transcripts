# Poll: 37% approve of Trump's handling on the economy
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM)
*  Joining us now Lance trover Republican strategist former spokesman for Doug Burgum's presidential campaign and Don Callaway [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=0.0s)]
*  Democratic strategist and host of the caucus room podcast so Lance nearly a hundred days into the second Trump administration [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=7.0600000000000005s)]
*  What do you see as his? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  successes and his failures I [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  Mean look it's it's been a busy 100 days [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=18.66s)]
*  I mean the border is effectively closed Mike Johnson is gonna have a tax cut package [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=21.34s)]
*  It's gonna go through in the next month and I suspect will have some trade deals coming forward out of the administration [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=25.5s)]
*  So I think Republicans are gonna have a lot of good stuff to talk about when it comes to the polling [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=30.86s)]
*  I mean look I expect when he's making big bold decisions like this his polling approval is gonna ebb and flow [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=34.96s)]
*  But if you look inside the polls his foundation is pretty strong [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=40.22s)]
*  If you look at some polls have come out and said hardly anybody would change their vote from November and almost every single poll [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=43.56s)]
*  That comes out voters know he's doing what he said he would do [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=49.22s)]
*  So my suspicion is that his foundation is pretty strong out there and approval ratings are a snapshot in time [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  So I think it's gonna ebb and flow but again when we see a tax cut package come through [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  We've got a border closed we get some trade deals going [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=61.72s)]
*  Republicans are going to have a pretty good summer and a lot of good stuff to talk about [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=64.16s)]
*  Those polls being a snapshot done. Let's look at some of those polls those snapshots a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=68.08s)]
*  Reuter Zips those poll found that 37% of Americans approve of Trump's handling of the economy [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=74.28s)]
*  That is a snapshot that is not good for any [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=80.8s)]
*  Republican and certainly not the person in the White House are Democrats [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=85.76s)]
*  You think doing enough to distinguish themselves from the president on the issue for example of tariffs [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=90.28s)]
*  Democrats are not doing enough to explain what their economic policy would be but I don't think that's the mission of Democrats at the moment [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=97.44s)]
*  Right now Democrats and frankly the world the business world the institutional leadership world [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=104.16s)]
*  Has done enough to show that whatever the president has done thus far specifically on the economy has resulted in broad [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=109.84s)]
*  uncertainty for not only the business community [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  But for average working class and middle-class families many of whom voted for this president [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=119.36s)]
*  And so I expect there to be something of a reduction in his approval rating of course because of the post inauguration [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=124.04s)]
*  Bump settling in but also what we're starting to see is a significant amount of uncertainty [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=130.12s)]
*  In Americans guts as the stock market whiplashes every day as we become familiar with people in our actual lives who have had their jobs [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=135.52s)]
*  Reduced and we have to realize that there is a long tail on the actions that we saw within the first 100 days [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=143.32000000000002s)]
*  Particularly as it pertains to the dozing of American government and these dramatic reductions [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=149.68s)]
*  You will see organizations that receive these funding grants be able to not retain staff into the fall [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=154.22000000000003s)]
*  You'll see further ramifications on a long end policy sales cycle and as those realities hit American people toward the summer and into the fall [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=159.4s)]
*  I expect that the approval rating will drop further as these realities settle in on Americans real pocketbooks in real lives [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  And dawn this morning senator dick Durbin joined my colleagues on morning Joe one day after he announced [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=173.8s)]
*  He won't be seeking reelection. He had a message for his fellow lawmakers take a listen [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=179.12s)]
*  This is a moment where there's a threat to the Constitution of the United States and our constitutional democracy [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=184.0s)]
*  We have to get it together. I will plead with my Republican friends stand up for the Constitution [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=189.52s)]
*  You took an oath and said you'd swear to defend this Constitution [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=195.16000000000003s)]
*  It needs defense now more than ever with the actions by President Trump and a hundred days of this administration [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=199.24s)]
*  The question is not whether Trump is sinking in a polling and he appears to be [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=205.56s)]
*  Polling and he appears to be but whether his fate is going to be shared by other Republicans and whether they have the courage to join [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=210.36s)]
*  Democrats and do the right things and stand to stand up for the Constitution [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=217.24s)]
*  Don is there a [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=222.72000000000003s)]
*  divide within the Democratic Party on how to react or how to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=225.16000000000003s)]
*  Message things that I'm thinking of the you know, Bernie Sanders and Alexandria [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  Ocasio-Cortez that are going across the country and getting thousands of people out and then there is the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=234.98000000000002s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, I guess side of it. Is there a divide there? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=241.02s)]
*  Not only is there a divide but there's a fundamental fracture of a thousand pieces with none of the factions who have an idea [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=245.82s)]
*  About how to go forward having a plurality or at least a stronghold on party leadership to be able to actually [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=251.9s)]
*  Galvanize a mass amount of people in the direction of what they would want to see so you have several [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=257.94s)]
*  Factions inside those fractures you have the AOC and the Bernie Sanders who are going around the country very effectively speaking to probably the broadest [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=262.9s)]
*  audience of progressives [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=270.58s)]
*  But then you have the institutionalist even though they might be younger and hip-hop or in minority like a Hikim Jeffries [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=271.65999999999997s)]
*  They are still [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=277.74s)]
*  institutionalists who want to try to work within the context of the House of Representatives and then you have a whole bunch of folks who [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=278.86s)]
*  Are saying you know what? I'm no longer professionally identifying as a Democrat [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=284.82s)]
*  I'm more of an independent because I really don't see my values reflected anywhere within one of the factions that has a stronghold on what's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=288.58000000000004s)]
*  Going to determine the future of the party so the party is in a thousand different pieces right now to be honest and we don't [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=295.46000000000004s)]
*  Have anybody with near the magnetism to express a democratic agenda like President Trump can express a Republican agenda [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=301.22s)]
*  Therefore a lot of his ideas even though they're really bad for people's actual lives go unchallenged [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=307.90000000000003s)]
*  And Lance there is no very little challenging to the president within the party [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=313.94s)]
*  Well look let's take a look at the Democrats Dave yeah, they agree [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=321.34s)]
*  They have a leadership vacuum [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=324.18s)]
*  But their agenda is pretty clear and it's going hard left survey USA had a poll out recently that said 50% of vote of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=325.65999999999997s)]
*  Democratic voters want the party to be more progressive and that's exactly what's going on Bernie Sanders AOC two socialists are leading the party [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=333.06s)]
*  Out there so there's no question where they're headed they may lack a leader a leader right now, but where they're headed is completely hard left [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=340.66s)]
*  Well last and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=348.1s)]
*  If by hard left we want to see the economy not whiplash every day then yes call us leftists I guess [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=351.14s)]
*  Gentlemen, thank you both so very much appreciate it [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=357.78000000000003s)]
*  You [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gJND1PoPHM&t=370.62s)]
