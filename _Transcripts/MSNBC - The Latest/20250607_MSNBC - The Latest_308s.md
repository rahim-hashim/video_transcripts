# Abrego Garcia’s criminal charges ‘reads like a bad novel’: Attorney for Abrego Garcia
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms)
*  Well, joining me now we have Brian Murray, senior partner at the law firm and part of the team representing Kilmar Abrego Garcia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks for being here, Brian. First of all, how much of a victory is this for your team, the fact that he is no longer in El Salvador and actually in Nashville, Tennessee? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=6.8s)]
*  Well, of course, we're very glad that he's home. And we're most of all really thrilled for Jennifer and the rest of Kilmar's family. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=16.4s)]
*  But it's fitting that this case began with an abuse of power and is now now the Kilmar's home, but only by an abuse of power. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=26.56s)]
*  Brian, I'm curious your reaction to the conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens charges that he is facing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=37.92s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=48.6s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm not a criminal attorney. We are not Kilmar's criminal counsel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=50.96s)]
*  But I read the indictment and honestly, it reads like a bad novel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=55.84s)]
*  And it's I think anyone who's looking to this case has been watching this play out would agree that this is a political and vindictive prosecution. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=59.92s)]
*  Brian, has anyone on your team talked with Abrego Garcia? And if so, what's he said? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=69.76s)]
*  Well, we're working on that right now. You know, we learned about Kilmar's return just like the rest of the country did. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=75.12s)]
*  And we're working on the logistics to get down there and visit with him for the very first time. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=81.56s)]
*  So here's something from The New York Times which writes, regardless of how the case turns out, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=87.56s)]
*  the return of Abrego Garcia suggests that the administration was, at least in some ways, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  feeling the heat of the three court orders it was facing to facilitate his freedom. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=97.6s)]
*  The decision could be read, in fact, as the Justice Department simultaneously caving to the orders while also flexing its muscles. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=103.24s)]
*  As Todd Blanch, the deputy AG, pointed out, the charges could render moot the lawsuit filed by Abrego Garcia's family. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  If that happens, it might get the White House off the hook entirely for the way in which it skirted due process in deporting him. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=119.24s)]
*  Brian, what do you make of that? And is that why the White House went from saying, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=126.92s)]
*  we can't bring him back to suddenly bringing him back to the U.S.? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=131.76s)]
*  Well, there's no doubt the timing is quite suspicious. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=136.88s)]
*  You know, they've admitted they began this investigation basically in the wake of the Supreme Court decision. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=139.2s)]
*  And sadly, it looks like this is a grand operation to save face. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=145.48s)]
*  All right. Let me get to the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, who is not saying when this investigation into Abrego Garcia was opened, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  but Abrego Garcia, we know, was deported in March. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  So I'm curious, Brian, what you make of the timeline and given the way the government has handled Abrego Garcia's case, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=162.72s)]
*  both in the courts and the way it's played out in the media, is that going to play into his defense, do you think? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  I can't say for sure. As I mentioned, we do not represent him on the criminal side. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=177.28s)]
*  And I can't speak to that. I'm not a criminal attorney. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=182.16s)]
*  But the timing is certainly suspect. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=185.72s)]
*  And, you know, another issue of timing, obviously, is just yesterday, the same day that this indictment is announced, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=189.68s)]
*  the chief of the criminal division, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee, resigned. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=196.36s)]
*  I think that that's telling all on its own. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  All right. Now, look, and I'm going to ask one more question. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=203.12s)]
*  And granted, I know you're not a criminal attorney, but just your sense of the law here, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  because the Washington Post points out at yesterday's conference, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  Bondi also took the unusual step of publicly accusing Abrego Garcia of other uncharged crimes, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=213.2s)]
*  including soliciting nude photos of a minor and playing a role in the murder of a rival gang member's mother. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  Asked why, if prosecutors had evidence to back up those claims, they had not pursued a case in court, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=227.84s)]
*  Bondi sidestepped the question. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=233.56s)]
*  So just big picture, what do you make of these accusations and their credibility? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=236.28s)]
*  Zero credibility. This administration has proven to have zero credibility across the board. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=242.6s)]
*  The key word in what you just read is uncharged. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=247.28s)]
*  They are throwing everything they can at Kilmar to to win the political war. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=251.28s)]
*  And that is shameful when this is a real legal matter and a real person's life. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=257.92s)]
*  Can you give me a sense of how the family is doing, though, the fact that he is back on U.S. soil? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=263.76s)]
*  Has that lifted their spirits? Yes, I think so. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  I think that they are obviously excited to just to be able to see him and to visit with him. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=272.44s)]
*  But of course, there's this new uncertainty clouding things. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=280.6s)]
*  For sure. Brian Murray, thank you for talking. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwj6pQ4-Ms&t=285.56s)]
