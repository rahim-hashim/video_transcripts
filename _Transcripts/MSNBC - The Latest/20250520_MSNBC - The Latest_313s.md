# The 'sell America' trade accelerates as global investors fret over GOP spending bill
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0)
*  Tonight in Money Power Politics, market jitters are back as investors swap their tariff concerns for deficit fears. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=0.0s)]
*  The New York Times reports that foreign investors are anxiously monitoring talks over the GOP spending mega bill. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=8.44s)]
*  This bill could add more than $3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=15.0s)]
*  Some analysts believe that the bill is accelerating the so-called sell America trade, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=21.0s)]
*  with foreign investors increasingly turning away from tried and true U.S. assets like the dollar, treasuries and bonds. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=26.48s)]
*  With me now to discuss all of this is Max Chafkin, Bloomberg Businessweek journalist and co-host of the Elon Inc. podcast. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  Also with us is Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Max, let's start with you. Are investors right to be nervous about this bill? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, this is, there's a ton of money that's potentially added to the deficit. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=51.48s)]
*  And if you go back a couple of months ago, all of these investors were talking about Doge getting very excited about the prospect of deficit reductions [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=55.48s)]
*  and sort of blinker to the fact that Trump all along has been talking about these tax increases. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=64.47999999999999s)]
*  Now you have Doge kind of, I don't know, flaming out, slowing down, however you want to put it, being somewhat de-emphasized. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  The budget cuts aren't coming. Meanwhile, you have this massive spending bill that I don't think anyone knows quite how big it's going to be. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=76.48s)]
*  And you have the economic impact of the tariffs. So lots of concerns for investors. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=83.48s)]
*  So, Justin, Max makes a great point. There's a lot of stuff going on. What's the confluence of all of these things? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=89.48s)]
*  The introduction of the tariffs, this new bill. What is all of this going to mean for the U.S. economy and the prospect of economic growth going forward? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=95.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good question, Melissa, because we could think about each of the things going on separately, but actually there's a unifying theme to all of it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=104.48s)]
*  The unifying theme is that folks on Wall Street are losing patience with the administration. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=112.48s)]
*  They've really come to question the competence of the administration. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=117.48s)]
*  I think it began with the absolutely, you know, they were very much in favor, Wall Street was very much in favor of Doge. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=121.48s)]
*  And then just the absolutely ridiculous rollout of the tariffs, which seem to suggest that there's no economic team home inside the White House. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=128.48s)]
*  And, you know, that could be OK if you're not doing anything. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=136.48s)]
*  Then you start to roll out fiscal policies that are based on extraordinarily misleading accounting and would involve the U.S. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=139.48s)]
*  going further into debt at a moment where the economy is still producing pretty well. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=149.48s)]
*  So there's if today is not the day you start to fix the debt, I don't know when you ever will. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=154.48s)]
*  You put all that together and these doubts about the competence of the administration. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=159.48s)]
*  That's behind what I think people are calling the sell America trade. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=165.48s)]
*  They're unwilling to park their money here because they no longer think this is the safest place in town. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=168.48s)]
*  And I want to add some of your more strident guests will say things like, you know, the threat to democracy and autocracy and so on. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=173.48s)]
*  I'm going to stay in my line. I'm not going to predict that's happening or not. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=181.48s)]
*  But I will tell you that the economic consequences of that are enormous. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=184.48s)]
*  And so small probabilities of catastrophic events are also weighing on people's minds. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=189.48s)]
*  I think those strident guests might be me, but I'll hold you for that for a minute. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=195.48s)]
*  I want to come back to a new report from Allianz, which says that more than half of American American companies are now saying that they're likely to raise their prices because of the tariffs. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=200.48s)]
*  How long will it be before consumers actually start to feel the pinch of all of this, Justin? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=210.48s)]
*  And what will it mean in practical terms if we have offshore investors refusing to park their money in the United States and then we have these kind of jitters here at home? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=215.48s)]
*  Yeah. So the interesting thing about that Allianz data is it says, you know, more than half expect to raise their prices. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=226.48s)]
*  Guess what? The other half are in the service sector. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=233.48s)]
*  There's no tariffs on services. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=236.48s)]
*  So basically everyone who's making stuff is planning on jacking up their prices. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=238.48s)]
*  There's a really important point here that I want the audience to understand because we've been through inflation recently with the post pandemic inflation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=243.48s)]
*  What happened then was your boss was raising their prices, which meant the stuff that you were making at work was getting sold for a higher price. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=251.48s)]
*  So it meant when prices rose later on, wages would catch up. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=260.48s)]
*  It would be painful for a year or two as we waited for wages to catch up. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=265.48s)]
*  There's something very different about a tariff caused inflation. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=270.48s)]
*  Now what happens is your boss's costs are going up and that's what drives the prices up. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=274.48s)]
*  There's no extra money to pay for your pay hike. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=280.48s)]
*  So this is an enduring cent. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=283.48s)]
*  This this is going to create a persistent lower wage for Americans. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=285.48s)]
*  It's a very, very different cost benefit analysis. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=290.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmNyM55dhU0&t=295.48s)]
