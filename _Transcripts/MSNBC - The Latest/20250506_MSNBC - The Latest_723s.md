# 'That's what Canadians wanted to hear': Canadian PM tells Trump his country is not for sale
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE)
*  America's Earth to President getting a big dose of Earth one reality this afternoon Donald Trump's delusions about Canada becoming a 51st state [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=0.0s)]
*  We're met with a hard no from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney inside the Oval Office [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=8.8s)]
*  Carney of course just won an election last week riding a wave of anti-Trump sentiment take a listen [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=14.92s)]
*  If I may [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=24.6s)]
*  As you know from real estate there are some places that are never for sale, that's true [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=26.76s)]
*  We're sitting in one right now, you know Buckingham Palace you visited as well [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  That's true and having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign last several months [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  It's not for sale won't be for sale ever but the opportunity is in the partnership and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=42.64s)]
*  It won't be for sale ever [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  And then a equivocal no delivered right to the face of the one making the threat over and over again to that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump said [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=62.32s)]
*  Never say never [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  Trump also claimed that the lack of a single any trade deals including importantly with China [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=66.04s)]
*  Is a good thing that we all have it wrong that we in the United States. We do not need trade [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  By not trading we're losing nothing so we saving a trillion dollars [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=78.94s)]
*  We also have a situation because everyone says when when when are you gonna sign deals? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=83.94s)]
*  We don't have to sign deals. We could sign [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=88.74s)]
*  25 deals right now Howard if we wanted we don't have to sign deal [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=91.78s)]
*  They have to sign deals with us. They want a piece of our market. We don't want a piece of their market [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=95.62s)]
*  We don't care about their market. They want a piece of our market [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=100.38s)]
*  Not at all how it works it turns out the idea [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=103.38s)]
*  That we do not need things from other places that we do not trade with other markets [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=107.5s)]
*  And that the world won't go on without us is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  Tragically for us another one of Donald Trump's delusions [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=116.69999999999999s)]
*  Trump's man-made economic catastrophe his [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=120.34s)]
*  Self-started trade war has led other countries to just sit around and just sit around and just sit around and just sit around [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=124.06s)]
*  His self-started trade war has led other countries to just turn away from us [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=129.17999999999998s)]
*  CNBC is reporting this quote what began as a rapid drop in US imports as shippers cut orders for [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=134.61999999999998s)]
*  Manufacturing partners around the world has now extended into a nationwide export slump with the US agricultural [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=140.57999999999998s)]
*  Sector and top farm products including soybeans corn and beef [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=147.98s)]
*  Taking the hardest hit the latest trade data shows that a slide in US [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=152.7s)]
*  Exports to the world and China in particular that began in January now extends to most US ports [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=157.06s)]
*  The new data also showed that for now Trump's tariffs were resulting in higher trade deficits [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=164.78s)]
*  Which is precisely the opposite that what even in his own world Donald Trump said he was going to accomplish on Liberation Day [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=170.54s)]
*  New York Times adding this quote the surge in imports was almost entirely due to the ingredients that pharmaceutical companies need to manufacture [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=178.78s)]
*  Drugs which Trump has been threatening to tariff one analyst tells the New York Times quote [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=186.17999999999998s)]
*  There was far less of everything else like toys furniture appliances kitchenware [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  Apparel etc imported in March than suspected meaning there was no surge in inventories of finished consumer goods [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=198.1s)]
*  What it means for us for Americans here according to the New York Times is this quote [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=205.61999999999998s)]
*  Store shelves will empty out sooner rather than later end quote [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=210.77999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump's delusions about trade and the economy meeting the harsh truth of reality is where we start today with some of our favorite [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  Reporters and friends David Gura is back. He's an anchor and correspondent for Bloomberg News [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=221.73999999999998s)]
*  Also joining us staff writer for the Atlantic co-author of the New York Times best-selling book abundance [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=226.45999999999998s)]
*  Derek Thompson is back and with me at the table New York Times investigative reporter Suzanne Craig [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=231.89999999999998s)]
*  Sue is born and raised in the great city of Calgary, Canada. So I have to start with you [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=236.98s)]
*  I am sorry that this is what Canada saw from America's president today. How did it go over? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=241.22s)]
*  You know, I think when I think what Mark Carney I think he achieved a lot today some of it was done simply in [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=249.54000000000002s)]
*  body language, however subtle [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=256.06s)]
*  You know, he raised his eye at the right moment, but not too high and and I just wish there was thought bubbles [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=258.46000000000004s)]
*  But I think for Mark Carney what he achieved is very clearly stating that Canada is not for sale [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=264.74s)]
*  And he got it in I think very graciously but firmly [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=271.18s)]
*  And and that's what Canadians wanted to hear [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=274.74s)]
*  So I thought it was effective from his point of view [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=278.06s)]
*  I saw the news alerts that went out from several papers afterwards and that was the news alert [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=280.58s)]
*  It's just amazing that at 4 o 4 p.m [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=285.26s)]
*  Today like the most news worthy thing that a world leader said to an American president is quote Canada is not for sale [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=288.9s)]
*  I know I it's really stunning when you think about just [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=295.8s)]
*  This is even we're even having this discussion and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=300.02000000000004s)]
*  You know the the discussions that have gone on between I think back to some things that Donald Trump told [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=303.62s)]
*  Foreign Prime Minister Trudeau about how the the treaty that the markets the Canadian border is up for grabs that the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=312.1s)]
*  Treaties on the Great Lakes that govern that govern the Great Lakes are are up for grabs now and all the things that they've gone [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=319.94000000000005s)]
*  Into he's not even just saying you know that that Canada is [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=327.52s)]
*  You know he's trying to buy Canada. He's looked at these treaties as people have looked at these treaties [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  It's no accident and the stakes are really high for Mark Carney. He's not only going to navigate that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=337.2s)]
*  He's got to sort out these treat these tariffs [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  In a way that doesn't crush Canada [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean Donald Trump has said that he wants to act bring bring Canada to its knees economic bite through economics [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=347.24s)]
*  David Gura [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=355.12s)]
*  That felt like one spinning plate of [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  Breaking news the other felt like the big reveal there [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=360.64s)]
*  Was Donald Trump reframing at least for the purposes of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=366.24s)]
*  His fans and supporters and for the world to see that that there are no deals coming [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean easy we don't need any deals. He kept saying [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  I [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  Was that news to people who had diligently written in their notebooks [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=380.79999999999995s)]
*  Does the people are calling the White House we have lots of deals coming I? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=386.11999999999995s)]
*  Don't think that it was news per se but it is as you're pointing out an evolution in rhetoric from this president over the last [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  Few weeks and it was at the beginning of this pause that we heard Howard Lutnick the Commerce Secretary talk about [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=396.28s)]
*  90 deals and in 90 days a kind of absurdly ambitious agenda for this administration to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  Negotiate and ink that many deals and in that time frame [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=407.48s)]
*  But there is this increasing disconnect between what we're hearing from the president and from his economic advisors Scott Besson [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=411.44000000000005s)]
*  The Treasury Secretary was on Capitol Hill today [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=416.6s)]
*  And he said there were 17 countries who were near a point where they could sign a deal with the US we heard 25 countries are [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=418.76000000000005s)]
*  Waiting for the US waiting for the White House to decide that the White House is ready to sign a deal with them [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=425.64000000000004s)]
*  So there's just a fuzziness surrounding all of it [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=430.88000000000005s)]
*  I think that that kind of extends to the conversation that took place in the Oval Office before that that meeting today there was a [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=433.12s)]
*  Very shrewd question from a reporter is there anything that Mark Carney the Prime Minister could say that would cause you to remove [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=439.24s)]
*  Tariffs that you've put in place on on Canada and President Trump was unequivocal no [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=445.64s)]
*  So it was a fascinating moment as Suzanne pointed out [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=450.08s)]
*  I mean I agree that the thought bubbles would have been incredibly useful [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=452.96s)]
*  But we saw a prime minister who has no political experience really yes [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=456.28s)]
*  Navigated this campaign and after a long career as a technocrat obviously won this very important federal election [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=460.76s)]
*  Figuring out all the right notes to hit during the course of that that conversation so [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=467.48s)]
*  Noting to the fact that he cares about fentanyl and border security all things that we know that President Trump really cares about but when [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=471.76s)]
*  It comes down to sort of the expectations of what could come out of this meeting [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=477.64s)]
*  it was really just this kind of performative aspect of [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  Friendship two leaders getting together that when I think a lot better than a lot of people would have expected going into this and that [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=484.84000000000003s)]
*  Started with kind of a wave and a handshake and a raised fist going into the White House when when Mark Carney arrived [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=490.32000000000005s)]
*  But in terms of any kind of tangible steps forward here when it comes to trade [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=497.0s)]
*  Nothing really I guess that was the expectation obviously there wouldn't be any kind of deal inked over the course of this meeting [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=501.0s)]
*  But but I think your broader point Nicole [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=506.28000000000003s)]
*  We're not any more advanced and kind of the granular trade negotiation than we were before it took place [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=508.84000000000003s)]
*  And I know David Gura uses the word friendship loosely because if I had any friends that put out social media posts like that about [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=514.32s)]
*  Me before I came over for tea. They would not be my friends at all [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=521.1800000000001s)]
*  Derek let me ask you to sort of pull out a little bit for us [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=526.0400000000001s)]
*  America just elected a felon for the first time in our history because eggs were too expensive and other stuff and [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=530.96s)]
*  Now that person who ran for office the highest office in our country's politics [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  Isn't just saying that things are gonna be more expensive. He's saying you don't need those things [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  You don't need 34 of one thing. You only need two that thing is a doll [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=549.12s)]
*  but most people spend a doll is a [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=553.12s)]
*  sort of an annual purchase a present a gift for a young child in in on Earth one where he obviously doesn't live but a [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=555.6400000000001s)]
*  whole bunch of other things are going to be out of reach or a lot more expensive and [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=563.36s)]
*  Either there aren't people around Donald Trump who have told him that or he doesn't care but either way is [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=568.72s)]
*  the slow-moving [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=576.12s)]
*  Political asteroid that's about to hit the entire Republican Party. I [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=578.02s)]
*  Have to go back to something that Trump said in the clip that you use at the top of the show [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=583.4s)]
*  He said by not trading [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=587.86s)]
*  We're not losing [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=590.44s)]
*  Anything and that statement is absolutely 100% correct except for the fact that US has totaled exports in 2024 total two trillion dollars [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=592.72s)]
*  so other than two trillion dollars of exports and [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=600.44s)]
*  3 trillion dollars of imports [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=604.9200000000001s)]
*  We're not losing anything with trading at the five trillion dollars worth of economic activity [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  That is imploded if America suddenly stops trading and when you dig into it, who's really going to be heard? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=611.84s)]
*  Here's a terrible irony [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=617.36s)]
*  You've got all this talk especially coming from people who are MAGA and say that they're for the working class [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=618.32s)]
*  They're for people who work in industry people who are farmers [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=622.6600000000001s)]
*  Guess what we import the most of to China [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=626.24s)]
*  It's billions and billions of dollars of soybeans and as you indicated right now [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=629.24s)]
*  Soybean farmers essentially cannot sell their stuff to China and as a result the port of port of Portland [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=634.2s)]
*  Oregon has found that the number of exports that are moving through it declined by 50% year-over-year [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=639.7600000000001s)]
*  Just last month we are imploding [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=644.72s)]
*  tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars of activity and for what [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=647.6s)]
*  For what there was no crisis of soybeans. There was no crisis in American industry [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=652.9200000000001s)]
*  We're doing all of this because Donald Trump fundamentally does not understand that trade is a positive some interaction [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=658.46s)]
*  Trade helps people if someone in China wants a soybean someone in France [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=665.08s)]
*  What's a soybean and some farmer in the middle of America wants to sell them a soybean? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=668.6800000000001s)]
*  Both groups work out with the exchange someone overseas gets the soybean [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=672.3s)]
*  They want a farmer in America gets the dollar that they need when you shut down international trade [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=676.4599999999999s)]
*  You take a positive some interaction and you implode it [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=681.54s)]
*  So this idea that Donald Trump said and it is verbatim. I wrote it down as I heard it by not treating [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=684.8599999999999s)]
*  We're not losing anything. This is not a small error. This is a five [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=691.4599999999999s)]
*  trillion dollar [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=696.8599999999999s)]
*  Calculation and there is a 0% chance that Americans don't feel it in the next few months [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQWl6tVrVBE&t=698.86s)]
