# ‘Every day I have been shocked and disgusted’: Judge Luttig on Trump weaponizing the Justice Dept
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8)
*  There are some really bad actors, some people that did some really bad things to the American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=0.0s)]
*  people. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=5.28s)]
*  And if they can be charged, we will charge them. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=6.28s)]
*  But if they can't be charged, we will name them. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=8.72s)]
*  And we will name them. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=11.34s)]
*  And in a culture that respects shame, they should be people that are shamed. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=12.34s)]
*  And that's a fact. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=17.94s)]
*  That's the way things work. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=18.94s)]
*  And so that's how I believe the job operates. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=19.94s)]
*  What happened on Earth 1 today, Earth 2? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=22.94s)]
*  Over on Earth 1, we are living a dramatically different reality, where prosecutors shouldn't [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=27.98s)]
*  just prosecute anyone. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=34.42s)]
*  They name and shame people they don't like. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=36.98s)]
*  That was Ed Martin talking about what they're going to do to Trump's perceived enemies. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=39.6s)]
*  He's the outgoing interim U.S. attorney for D.C., turned director of Trump's so-called [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=44.58s)]
*  DOJ weaponization working group because Republicans rebelled against his confirmation, so he couldn't [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=50.34s)]
*  be confirmed. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=56.14s)]
*  From NBC News' Ryan Reilly, quote, Ed Martin described himself at a press conference as [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=57.54s)]
*  the captain of the group that is investigating prosecutors who launched past investigations [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=62.54s)]
*  into Trump and his allies, quote, including that of former special counsel Jack Smith, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=67.66s)]
*  any federal cooperation with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and New York Attorney [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=72.74s)]
*  General Letitia James, the Justice Department's handling of cases related to the January 6 [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=77.3s)]
*  Capitol attack and criminal prosecutions of anti-abortion activists, among other issues. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=82.22s)]
*  It shows how far this administration is going to destroy norms and the rule of law in the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=88.26s)]
*  United States of America to please Donald Trump and meet his wishes to be treated like [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=93.34s)]
*  a king. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=98.52s)]
*  It's something that our next guest, former federal judge Michael Ludig, writes about [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=99.52s)]
*  in The Atlantic today. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  Judge Ludig joins us now. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=104.82s)]
*  Judge, you've spoken so powerfully about this. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=106.66s)]
*  I know it's your own peril. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=110.02s)]
*  Take us through what you've written in The Atlantic. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=113.89999999999999s)]
*  Nicole, you know, the genesis of the article is this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=118.42s)]
*  I've been watching along with all the other Americans for the past three months, the President's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=123.17999999999999s)]
*  first hundred days in office. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=130.66s)]
*  And every day I've been shocked and disgusted. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=134.42s)]
*  Not all Americans have been shocked or disgusted, but many have. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=141.7s)]
*  But many, if not most Americans, have been asking throughout these hundred days, does [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=146.86s)]
*  the President really have this power in our constitutional system to issue all of these [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=155.18s)]
*  executive orders and take all of these other actions as President of the United States? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=163.12s)]
*  And many of those people have asked that question of me. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=169.12s)]
*  And so as the hundred days closed, I decided that I would compile the various actions that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=173.44s)]
*  the President had taken, in particular his signature initiatives, and catalog them and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=183.24s)]
*  present them to the American public in this article in The Atlantic that ran today. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  The substantive conclusion of the article is that the President of the United States [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  doesn't have the power under the Constitution or laws of the United States for any single one of his [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=208.6s)]
*  signature initiatives undertaken in his first hundred days. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=219.56s)]
*  I think and I thought of myself in writing this article as little more than a scrivener or a scribe [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=226.12s)]
*  of the President's actions and their illegality. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=236.32s)]
*  And I just marshaled, frankly, all of the authority that's out there in the Constitution [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=242.44s)]
*  and the laws of the United States, together with the opinions of the federal courts that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=249.64s)]
*  have rejected virtually every single initiative that he has taken in his first hundred days, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=258.6s)]
*  at least preliminarily, if not finally. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=267.0s)]
*  And that's why I titled the article as I did, which is the end of the rule of law in America. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=271.40000000000003s)]
*  Because when the President of the United States from the Oval Office is undertaking illegal initiative after illegal initiative, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=281.96s)]
*  unconstitutional initiative after unconstitutional initiative, then we cannot say, at least for the period when he is President of the United States, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=293.4s)]
*  that we have a government of laws, not of men. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=309.64s)]
*  The president has presented himself as above the law. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=315.96s)]
*  I actually say in this article with support that he regards himself as the law. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=322.28s)]
*  And of course, that's the very antithesis of our founding, the antithesis of our Constitution, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=331.0s)]
*  and the antithesis of everything that America stands for, Nicole. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=339.32s)]
*  Judge, you have incredible reach when you're on this show. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=344.12s)]
*  I know it's like a boulder thrown in a pond. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=347.6s)]
*  It ripples for days and days. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=351.16s)]
*  I wonder what you do. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=353.16s)]
*  And I ask you this because I'm sometimes in this situation. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=355.4s)]
*  It is the most Republican thing and the most conservative thing before the time of Trump to write and say out loud everything you put in this piece. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=358.52s)]
*  But it is viewed as anti-Trump. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  You are viewed as a voice against Trump. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=369.0s)]
*  And I think that some of our work is to say for Trump against Trump, being for the rule of law shouldn't make you against anybody, certainly not against the sitting American president. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=371.24s)]
*  What Trump has done is to pervert the law. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=381.12s)]
*  We started with the story about him firing 60 years worth of nonpartisan intelligence experts. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=383.20000000000005s)]
*  They'd worked for Democrats and Republicans their whole career. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=389.8s)]
*  That was their plan for their lives. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  That no matter which political party won an American election, they would work in the intelligence community to protect America. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=394.16s)]
*  There's a whole thing that I feel like the pro-democracy movement has seeded that somehow you're for Trump or against Trump if you're simply articulating the rule of law. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=400.56s)]
*  How do you push back to the center and to get a majority of Americans to understand that being for the rule of law shouldn't make you against any American politician? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=409.0s)]
*  Good question. And first off, the word that you chose is exactly correct. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=422.32s)]
*  The president has perverted the law. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=427.76s)]
*  He has perverted the Constitution and the laws of the United States for the past 100 days. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=431.56s)]
*  Which is to say, and your viewers should understand this, for not one of his signature initiatives of 15, maybe 20, does he have support in the Constitution of the United States and the laws. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=439.0s)]
*  I was listening to your segment just before I came on. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=456.64000000000004s)]
*  One of his two signature initiatives is the deportation of illegal immigrants to this country. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=461.20000000000005s)]
*  As Ms. Lennox said, the president has no authority whatsoever under the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=471.8s)]
*  And every single federal court to address the issue to date has so held, with the exception, interestingly, Nicole, of the court in the Western District of Pennsylvania just yesterday afternoon. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=479.56s)]
*  And the opinion by that judge, it was reasoned, it was long, it was thorough, but it was tortured reasoning. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=498.84s)]
*  But in the end, Nicole, that judge relied upon Donald Trump's representation that the gang was working at the behest of the Maduro regime. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=509.28s)]
*  So your segment just before mine completely undercut the rationale of that judge yesterday, which would mean that as of this moment, there's not a federal court in America who has upheld Donald Trump's deportation of illegal immigrants. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6TErsExV8&t=525.96s)]
