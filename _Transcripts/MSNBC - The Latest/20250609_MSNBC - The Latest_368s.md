# Lawrence and Rachel Maddow discuss Trump saying in 2020 presidents can't deploy the National Guard
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8)
*  We have laws. We have to go by the laws. We can't move in the National Guard. I can call [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=0.0s)]
*  insurrection but there's no reason to ever do that, even in a Portland case. We can't [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  call in the National Guard unless we're requested by a governor. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=10.56s)]
*  Thank God it is finally time for the last word with Lawrence O'Donnell. Good evening, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=14.0s)]
*  Lawrence. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=17.64s)]
*  Rachel, go on and on. There's no hurry. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=18.64s)]
*  I have been looking forward to hearing what you have to say in your A-block tonight all [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=21.12s)]
*  weekend long. I cannot wait. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=26.96s)]
*  You know, Rachel, in 2020 when Donald Trump was in what was then his failed reelection [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=29.32s)]
*  campaign for president against Joe Biden, he very specifically, in an interview with [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=35.04s)]
*  George Stephanopoulos, he very specifically said the president cannot just send in the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=40.14s)]
*  National Guard to any state. The governor has to request it and the president cannot [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=48.0s)]
*  just send them in. And he said, I could, something like, you know, I could call an insurrection [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=53.92s)]
*  but that hasn't happened. And so he's on record, of course, saying exactly the opposite [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=60.24s)]
*  of what he's now doing, as he has been with so many things. But this one is really quite [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  striking. I think we're going to have that video ready. Actually, they're working on [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=74.2s)]
*  it right now. The longer you and I talk about it, it gives them a minute in the control [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=79.32s)]
*  room to get that piece inserted where I'm hoping it's going to be inserted when we need [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=84.08s)]
*  it. But it's right there and we'll have it by the end of the hour if we don't have it [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=89.32s)]
*  early. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=92.72s)]
*  I mean, the difference between when he was talking about that then and what he's doing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=93.72s)]
*  now is that whether or not he remembers what he once knew about how America works, he's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  decided that he's throwing it all out. You know, dictator from day one and, you know, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  he's going to terminate parts of the Constitution and he's decided that he doesn't matter what [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=108.72s)]
*  Congress does and it doesn't matter what the courts do, that he's just the strong man. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=113.44s)]
*  He's going to be, you know, in for another term in 2028. I mean, he's decided to throw [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=117.52s)]
*  out all the rules. The thing that that has done, as far as I'm concerned, is make him [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=121.64s)]
*  very boring because it's like it's all on the table. We know exactly what he's doing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=126.92s)]
*  We know exactly what his intentions are. He is blonde Berlusconi. This is just, I mean, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=131.28s)]
*  he's just trying to do the same thing all the other strong men and would-be dictators [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=135.96s)]
*  do all over the country. I think the really interesting question is what the country lets [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=139.8s)]
*  him get away with and we're seeing a really interesting test of that right now all over [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=144.24s)]
*  the country, especially this week. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=148.36s)]
*  And we're also seeing the difference between the advisors he had in the White House the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=150.68s)]
*  first time and the people he has now. He obviously had a White House counsel in his first presidency [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=154.68s)]
*  who was telling him, no, it's illegal. You cannot just send in the National Guard. The [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=160.32s)]
*  governor has to request it. And now he has people telling him whatever he wants to hear, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=166.12s)]
*  whenever he wants to hear it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=171.64s)]
*  Yeah. I think that if we can intuit what he's being told, I think based on the pattern of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=173.12s)]
*  his actions, we can probably intuit that what he's being told is, yeah, it's illegal, therefore [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=178.68s)]
*  go do it. I mean, I think that the more laws he breaks, the more blatantly unconstitutional [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=183.28s)]
*  things he both proposes and tries, I think the more they think power accrues to him because [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=189.4s)]
*  he's less constrained by things that don't actually stop him. And so ultimately, I mean, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=194.0s)]
*  the courts are pushing him back. Congress to a certain extent is pushing him back a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=198.68s)]
*  little bit, although I think a little bit more than they're giving credit for. But mostly [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=202.28s)]
*  it's the people pushing him back. He's deeply, deeply, deeply unpopular and underwater on [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=205.44000000000003s)]
*  every issue. And he is absolutely panicked by the protests against him to the point where [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=210.12s)]
*  he's already playing the biggest cards that he's got and he's not even six months into [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=215.32000000000002s)]
*  this term. I just think I think we're getting the test really early and I think that he's [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=218.84s)]
*  failing. By the way, one of the important things that Mayor Bass brought out when you [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=224.0s)]
*  were talking to her about what's happening in Los Angeles tonight, and you know this, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=229.12s)]
*  but just how isolated and tiny a spot of Los Angeles we're talking about. Downtown Los [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=233.12s)]
*  Angeles, where in the areas where these office buildings are, very few people live anywhere [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=239.84s)]
*  near that. It's not a residential area. Most people living in Los Angeles, most Los Angeles [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  local taxpayers never set foot in that part of Los Angeles. You can easily live a life there [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=251.88s)]
*  and never see it. And so it is this this really isolated little spot that doesn't in any way [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=257.56s)]
*  disrupt any protest that's being held down there outside of federal building doesn't in any way [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=265.16s)]
*  disrupt anything about the way life is lived in Los Angeles. I mean even with I mean even if [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=271.32s)]
*  these protests were 100 times the size that they are, there still wouldn't be an operational reason [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=276.76s)]
*  to bring in active duty troops or federalized national guard. I mean it's just it's not it's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=283.8s)]
*  not that sort of thing. This is obviously not operationally necessitated right in terms of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=289.0s)]
*  the security of the city. He's doing this because he's panicking and thinks that he looks weak and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=294.2s)]
*  therefore he has to do something that seems strong. And so we will have tanks destroying [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=301.0s)]
*  the streets of Washington this Saturday and we will have national guardsmen and active duty U.S. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=305.56s)]
*  Marines standing around Los Angeles wondering what their what this has to do with their military [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=311.24s)]
*  careers. And it's all because he has no freaking idea how to deal with this politically and he's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=316.6s)]
*  absolutely panicking about the I think trenchant and joyful and sustainable opposition against him. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=322.84s)]
*  Yeah it is clearly something he is has been all too eager to do. Yeah exactly. Right. Once you've [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=329.24s)]
*  done this though there's not much else to do. Sorry big guy last card. Right we will see. Thank [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=336.04s)]
*  you Rachel. Thanks Lawrence. Thanks. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=340.12s)]
*  you [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erlAzfshUJ8&t=359.24s)]
