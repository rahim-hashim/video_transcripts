# Trump shrugs off shortage fears: Kids may get 'two dolls instead of 30’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. 100 days in the Trump presidency. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=0.0s)]
*  The U.S. economy is now shrinking for the first time in years, and it's all Donald Trump's fault. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=4.16s)]
*  That may sound overly simplistic or unfair, but in this case, it's just really true, much truer [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=10.56s)]
*  than it usually is with presidents. Remember where we were before all this, right? The last [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=17.84s)]
*  administration, President Joe Biden, had to deal with this enormous set of challenges, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=22.88s)]
*  supply disruption that came out of the wake of COVID and then inflation and the war in Ukraine, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=27.76s)]
*  which spiked oil prices, and they managed to steer through the whole thing. Inflation came down as [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=33.6s)]
*  wages stayed high and unemployment neared record lows. They ended up with this kind of Goldilocks, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=39.2s)]
*  not too hot, not too cool economy, a very difficult trick to pull off. It never went into recession, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  something so many people on TV kept saying was coming right around the corner over and over and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=51.84s)]
*  over. And the upshot of all this was that Joe Biden handed Donald Trump an American economy that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=57.28s)]
*  had gone through unbelievable turmoil and had emerged as the global growth leader. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=65.04s)]
*  Donald Trump took office on January 20th with yet another sweet inheritance. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=71.36s)]
*  Honestly, you know, Trump is, he is inheriting a strong economy. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=77.6s)]
*  It's not like, you know, a President Trump comes in and has to rebuild a broken down [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=82.16s)]
*  economy in his own way. The setup's great, right? I mean, Trump is inheriting an economy, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=88.4s)]
*  both a market economy. So the Wall Street economy looks good. Obviously, I mean, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=94.88s)]
*  we're talking everything's out. The Main Street economy looks good. Stay the course, folks. We [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  have the best, we're going to have the best economy of any industrialized country. If it were a movie, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=104.32s)]
*  this Economist magazine cover from last October would have been the kind of movie poster. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=110.0s)]
*  America's economy, the envy of the world. And again, all Donald Trump had to do was just not [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=114.48s)]
*  screw it up. But he's really, really intent on screwing it up. So today, we got this big [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=122.4s)]
*  flashing warning sign, which is that the American economy contracted, meaning it shrank. The nation's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=129.52s)]
*  GDP, all the goods and services we all produce, the total value of the economy, it shrank in the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=135.04s)]
*  first quarter of this year by three tenths of a percent. Now, I should say it contracted for [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  somewhat weird reasons in terms of the technical measures of how this happens, how GDP accounting [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  works, right? A huge part of driving this contraction number was that Americans actually [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  massively increased, counterintuitively, our imports from other countries. Our trade deficits [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=159.12s)]
*  went up because why? Well, because everyone's scared of higher costs and emptier shells from [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=164.56s)]
*  the tariffs. Okay. But again, that's not some act of God. It's not a pandemic. People are behaving [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=169.52s)]
*  that way because Donald Trump has started this wildly destructive trade war, which is likely to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=176.8s)]
*  continue to cost enormous amounts of growth and jack up prices on all imported goods and possibly [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=182.32s)]
*  pitch the economy fully into recession. A new worry is that Trump's import tax will be a nightmare [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=188.0s)]
*  for Christmas. That's because supply chains take a very long time to materialize. Retailers are [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=193.68s)]
*  even ordering ahead for the Christmas season. And toy makers and retailers are now pausing orders [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=198.56s)]
*  to the winter holidays. Ninety percent of America's Christmas goods come from, yes, you guessed it, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=203.36s)]
*  China. Barbie dolls, things like that, China. And if you're waiting for jolly old St. Trump to save [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  Christmas, listen to this. When will you speak to President Xi of China? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=214.96s)]
*  Look, right now, and I told you before, they're having tremendous difficulty because their [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=224.0s)]
*  factories are not doing business. They made a trillion dollars with Biden, a trillion dollars, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=228.24s)]
*  even a trillion won with Biden selling us stuff. Much of it we don't need. You know, somebody said, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=235.44s)]
*  oh, the shelves are going to be open. Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=242.56s)]
*  dolls, you know, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=247.44s)]
*  But we're not talking about something that we have to go out of our way. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=252.24s)]
*  Oh, the golden toilet guy is now preaching minimalism. Who needs all this stuff? Really? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=257.6s)]
*  Imagine if that had been Donald Trump's 2024 campaign message. You already have too much [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  crap. You spoiled brats. You and your kids are going to have to make do with less. And the less [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=270.08s)]
*  stuff is going to be more expensive. Every economic expert and CEO has been warning him for months [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=275.44s)]
*  that this would happen, but he's not listening to them because he's listening to himself and his [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=281.04s)]
*  own experts like Peter Navarro. When you strip out inventories and the negative effects of the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=285.44s)]
*  surge in imports because of the tariffs, you have 3% growth. So we really like where we're at now. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=292.32s)]
*  Yes, it's true. If not for the tariffs, it would be great because you'd basically have the Biden [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=301.68s)]
*  economy that Trump inherited. The Wall Street Journal reports instead that the Dow is now [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=307.68s)]
*  headed for its worst April since Herbert Hoover in 1932, the height of the Great Depression. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=312.8s)]
*  That the S&P 500's performance since Inauguration Day is now the worst for any president up to this [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=317.52s)]
*  point in data going back to 1928. Of course, Trump's spin is not a new one. Blame Joe Biden. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=323.2s)]
*  I don't view the stock market as the end goal. It's an indicator. But what the stock market [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  really tells you and what you when you look at the stock market in this case is it says how bad [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=336.88s)]
*  the situation we inherited. I took the place. This is a quarter that we looked at today. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=342.64s)]
*  And I took we took all of us together. We came in on January 20th. So this is Biden. And you can [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=348.4s)]
*  even say the next quarter sort of Biden because it doesn't just happen on a daily or narrowly basis. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=356.4s)]
*  Okay, this quarter, maybe the next quarter or two, that'll be Biden. Although if there's [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  growth next quarter, I bet you won't be Biden. So strange how the stock market market under [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=365.68s)]
*  President Trump is really Joe Biden's while the stock market under Joe Biden was somehow Trump's. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=371.04s)]
*  The Biden team can say, well, if things are so bad, how can the stock markets on a roll? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=377.36s)]
*  Because they think I'm going to be elected. That you think the stock markets rally because [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=381.68s)]
*  people think you're going to be like, yeah, between inflation and the horrible economy. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=385.68s)]
*  And the only reason, by the way, the stock market goes up is I'm leading in all the polls. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=390.48s)]
*  If I weren't leading the stock market would be way down. You know, a lot of people say the only [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=395.36s)]
*  reason the stock market size everyone thinks I'm going to win the election. I believe that's true. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=399.84s)]
*  I don't want to say this is to braggadocious, but we'll say it anyway. The Trump effect. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=403.84s)]
*  It's you. You're the effect. Since the election, the stock market is surged. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=408.8s)]
*  So credit where credit is due. This is Donald Trump's economy. Now it really is his. He truly [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=415.2s)]
*  owns it. The stock market went down because of what he did. Again, this is genuinely pretty rare [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=419.28s)]
*  for presidents, right? The presidents get praise or blame for the economy, but they don't affect it [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=424.4s)]
*  in the tangible and immediate way that Donald Trump has done so. Economic growth in America is [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=429.44s)]
*  now negative because of solely what Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone did. Not even anything that [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  Congress did because he did it unilaterally. And all he had to do, all he had to do was nothing. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=440.0s)]
*  Just build on the economy he had inherited. And he chose to squander it instead. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Ete-uAifM&t=447.2s)]
