# ‘Conclave’ author reveals insider look into the ‘ultimate election’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc)
*  We are awaiting word on when the conclave to elect the next pope will begin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=0.0s)]
*  This afternoon, the Sistine Chapel closed to the public as preparations begin for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  one of the most high stakes and secretive elections. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  All this renewing interest in last year's Oscar-winning film, Conclave. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=12.88s)]
*  The pope is dead. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=19.76s)]
*  The throne is vacant. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=21.76s)]
*  The conclave begins now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=24.48s)]
*  We're about to choose the most famous man in the world. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=26.24s)]
*  And one and a quarter billion souls watching. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  It was a fabulous film and joining me now is former journalist and novelist [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=35.2s)]
*  Robert Harris. He is the author of Conclave, which is the inspiration behind the film, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=39.28s)]
*  which was by the way distributed by our sister company, Focus Features. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  Robert, thank you so much for joining me. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  I want to first begin by asking what you had in terms of an inspiration for writing your book [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=50.800000000000004s)]
*  and then to have it turned into a film that won the Oscar for best adapted screenplay. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=56.72s)]
*  That's extraordinary. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=60.96s)]
*  And we want to note that viewership for Conclave, it spiked 283% following Pope Francis' death. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=62.32s)]
*  So all of this, what's your reaction? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, first of all, I'm very sorry that the pope has died. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=74.16s)]
*  I think he was a very good man. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=78.8s)]
*  So I'm slightly embarrassed in a way to kind of profit out of this tragic event. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=81.92s)]
*  But obviously, it's very gratifying to see a book that I wrote eight years ago, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  back in the charts and rising again. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=97.12s)]
*  I put a lot into that book. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=100.8s)]
*  I'm very fond of it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=102.24s)]
*  It's one of my favorite of the novels I've written. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=103.2s)]
*  I was a political journalist before I became a novelist, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=107.28s)]
*  and the book is about the ultimate election. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  That's what drew me to it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=114.4s)]
*  I wanted to write about this incredibly secret but very, very important election. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  And you did so, so beautifully. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  So I have to ask, with all of the incredible detail you include, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  were you able to get insider access? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=126.4s)]
*  I'm curious what the whole process was like writing it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=129.12s)]
*  And was there anything, Robert, that surprised or shocked you? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=132.0s)]
*  Well, I wrote to the Vatican and said that I wanted to write a novel about the Conclave. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  And all I asked for was to visit the scenes inside the locations. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  And they very kindly agreed to that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=148.08s)]
*  So I went to the Casa Santa Marta, which is where the cardinals will be staying [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=149.68s)]
*  once the Conclave begins, with their phones taken off them, shutters sealed in all the rooms. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=155.36s)]
*  I saw the Sistine Chapel. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=163.28s)]
*  I saw the Room of Tears, as it's called, where the pope, when they've been elected, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=164.88s)]
*  goes to be dressed before their appearance on the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=170.16s)]
*  I saw the Pauline Chapel and the Vatican Gardens, all that sort of thing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=175.28s)]
*  So they were incredibly helpful. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=179.28s)]
*  And the research that I did, I suppose the thing that struck me most was just how political the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=181.84s)]
*  process is. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=187.92s)]
*  I mean, it's a series of exhaustive ballots until one candidate has a two-thirds majority. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=189.04s)]
*  So this is very political. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  The people, the men inside the Sistine Chapel, locked inside, they know who tops each ballot [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=198.0s)]
*  and who's running second and third and so on. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=204.88s)]
*  So you can see the front runner. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  You can see who's likely to win. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  And they gather, the opponents of that person, or the ones who don't think you make a good pope, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=210.88s)]
*  gather behind another candidate. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=216.0s)]
*  So it's a very dramatic process. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=218.16s)]
*  And do you have a sense of the way it was depicted in the film versus the reality [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=221.92s)]
*  of the process? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=228.48s)]
*  Do you think the film did a good job of showing that? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes, I do very much so. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=233.28s)]
*  The film was very faithful to the novel. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=234.88s)]
*  And I spent a lot of time with the screenwriter and the director, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  André Fiennes, I met and talked about that role. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  So it's a very good depiction of the novel. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=245.83999999999997s)]
*  And the novel was the best I could make as a depiction of the actual conclave process. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=248.8s)]
*  And I did talk to a cardinal about it, the British cardinal, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  Cormac Murphy O'Connor, who did like the book for its research, which he said was good. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=258.56s)]
*  And as for the ending, he says, he said, I told myself it's only a story. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=265.52s)]
*  Well, I'm sure it was gratifying, though, to get that sort of compliment on the research [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=271.68s)]
*  and how wonderful you did it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=275.6s)]
*  We know Pope Francis was the first non-European pope in over a millennium. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=278.08s)]
*  And both your novel as well as the film emphasize how there seems to be a big push for the return [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=282.08s)]
*  of Italian pope, of an Italian pope. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=286.88s)]
*  And many of these cardinals, as you know, they're coming from all over. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=289.11999999999995s)]
*  They probably don't know each other. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=292.0s)]
*  How likely is it, Robert, that there is going to be alliances forming right now? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, well, yes, there will be. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=301.52s)]
*  There will be alliances chiefly to do with doctrine and attitude to social questions. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=303.44s)]
*  And that broadly, like most politics, devolves into progressives or reformists versus traditionalists. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  But allied to that, definitely, there are these regional variations. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=320.72s)]
*  Europe still predominates. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=325.68s)]
*  And there is a feeling that the Italians haven't had a pope for nearly 50 years. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=327.36s)]
*  They had a Pole and then a German and then an Argentinian. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=333.2s)]
*  So that they would like to see an Italian. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  Now, whether they will vote as a black or white pope, that I doubt, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=339.68s)]
*  because they'll be affected by the other pressures of the pope. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=342.88s)]
*  But I think also there is a desire to be a black African pope, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  because this is where the great growth areas are for the Catholic church. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=354.48s)]
*  We'll just have to wait and see. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=359.28s)]
*  You can't possibly tell. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  The favorite almost invariably loses. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=361.76s)]
*  So, you know, it's anybody's race. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=364.64s)]
*  Which then means that it may be longer than one would expect. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  Do you have any expectation for the length of time it'll take, this conclave? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=371.12s)]
*  Well, it's very unusual for a conclave to go beyond five ballots. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=377.12s)]
*  The first ballot is on the first day. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=381.52s)]
*  We see them go into the Sistine Chapel, the doors lock behind them, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=383.67999999999995s)]
*  and then they have a vote. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=387.67999999999995s)]
*  And in that vote, you get an enormous number of candidates get one vote, maybe, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  because a lot of people, frankly, vote for themselves or they vote for a friend. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=394.8s)]
*  The next day, it starts to get more serious. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=399.76000000000005s)]
*  There are two ballots the next morning and two ballots the next afternoon. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=402.24s)]
*  And normally, by the middle of the afternoon of the second day, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=405.68s)]
*  there's a result. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=409.44000000000005s)]
*  The white smoke emerges or the final vote on the second day. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=410.32000000000005s)]
*  If it goes into a third day, i.e. to a sixth ballot, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=415.44s)]
*  that would be very unusual that I don't think has happened. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=419.68s)]
*  I don't think it's happened since the Second World War, actually. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=423.36s)]
*  I'll tell you, Robert Harris, celebrated author of Conclave, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=427.36s)]
*  it's been very lovely speaking with you. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=430.16s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=432.08s)]
*  The book is fabulous, as you know, from so many sources beyond me. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=432.88s)]
*  Appreciate you. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=436.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=437.44s)]
*  Very nice of you to have me on. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=437.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3YfdYJCwZc&t=439.52s)]
