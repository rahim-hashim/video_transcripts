*  second signal chat is just the latest in a string of controversies at the Pentagon right now there's Jeffrey Goldberg revealing that Hegseth [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=132.12s)]

*  advisors all that has happened in the last 30 days it's why the call is now coming from inside the house once loyal Hegseth aid calling for [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=163.04s)]
*  Trump to remove Hegseth former Pentagon spokesperson John Elliott writes in Politico this quote the last month has been a full blown meltdown at [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  the Pentagon it's becoming a real problem for the administration the Pentagon focus is no longer on war fighting but endless drama joining our [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=181.44s)]
*  conversation NBC News national security correspondent Courtney QB also joining us secretary Frank Kendall former secretary of the Air Force during the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=189.52s)]
*  Biden administration Mr. Secretary I start with you and just your sense of the crises roiling the Pentagon [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=198.12s)]
*  Well I think we've reached a point where the solution to this problem is getting pretty obvious now yeah there's a certain latitude with a new appointee when they come in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=205.68s)]
*  but Secretary Hegseth has pretty much demonstrated that he's really not up to the job that he has and we're talking about that right now instead of other things I'm sure the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  president would rather we be talking about and there's a point for any political appointee when you become an embarrassment to the administration and a distraction from [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  higher priorities certainly that it's time for you to go and it would appear that we're there now President Trump may not have reached that conclusion yet but it's hard to come to any other conclusion [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=233.76s)]
*  I mean Courtney I know we're so many years post irony and that irony is dead and buried but the idea that the Trump administration and the Pentagon and the national security apparatus are ensnared [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=244.72s)]
*  in an all encompassing easily understandable debacle about disclosing classified information on personal phones and personal messaging apps is unbelievable and the notion that Trump is tolerant to what feel like constant lapses in judgment from Pete Hegseth needs to be explained to me by somebody like you how are we here? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=257.28s)]
*  I have to say Nicole when you ran through all of that in the intro in the last 30 days I can now and remember why I'm so exhausted because there has been so much that's been backed in in the past month starting with the Atlantic story the first Signal Chat remember at the time the most grievous error that the administration saw was the fact that a journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was added to that chat and that sort of overshadowed the fact that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=281.44s)]
*  texted information on that chat that no matter what the Pentagon says about it not being classified was clearly information about an upcoming military operation and imminent military operation with manned aircraft manned ships people who would be in direct danger if that information got out and how potentially dangerous that was well now fast forward we now know it's the second beat to this story is the fact that Secretary Hegseth himself created another Signal Chat and that's what we're going to be talking about in a moment [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=309.2s)]
*  and I want to talk about the second part of the story that he created a Signal Chat where he also shared information of a similar dangerous nature to U.S. men and women in uniform but in this case it wasn't going the information wasn't going to cabinet officials it wasn't going to senior people in the Trump administration in fact it was going to relatives his brother who does work here in the Pentagon but he has a role that that deals with Department of Homeland Security here and Homeland Defense his wife she has no role here at the Pentagon we have asked multiple times if she has a clearance and never gotten a response [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=339.2s)]
*  and to his private attorney as you mentioned who also is now here in some capacity in the Navy reserves but again the key to this was the information that was provided here now according to the Atlantic text chat the first thing that Secretary Hegseth tweeted or excuse me texted was that the mission is a go as soon as the mission is a go the information changes to a whole new set of classification essentially it is on a need to know basis that information would go out and that is because [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=369.2s)]
*  once it's a go ships are moving aircraft are getting ready to start launching and there again men and women's lives could be at stake and only the people who would really need to know the specifics of the launch plan of the times of when the bombs would be dropping only they would have access to that and at this point Nicole it makes no sense why relatives of the Secretary of Defense would need to know it looks on its surface that he was just bragging about the operation that was about to be underway and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=399.2s)]
*  a new development also late last week it's part of this investigation that's here at the Pentagon looking into who's providing this information well three of his closest advisors now have been escorted out of the building and the only reason that we've gotten here from the Department of Defense is that it's as part of this leak investigation and today when he was Secretary Hegseth at the Easter egg roll at the White House when he was asked about why they were fired or why they were removed from their jobs he specifically [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=429.2s)]
*  called them leakers Nicole the amount of info of events that are occurring here at the Pentagon every day and the dramatic lack of information the public is getting about them is something I've never seen here before [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=459.2s)]
*  you [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO0DB2Gfxds&t=489.2s)]
