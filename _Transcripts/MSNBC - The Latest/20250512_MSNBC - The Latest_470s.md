# Rep. Brendan Boyle on Trump's Qatari jet: 'He is the greatest grifter in American history'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4)
*  House committees will begin debating President Trump's big, beautiful tax and budget bill this week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=0.0s)]
*  And on Friday night, House Republicans released a draft of their tax proposals. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=7.2s)]
*  That version is expected to cost nearly $5 trillion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=11.6s)]
*  President Trump this week told Republicans to raise taxes on some of the wealthiest Americans, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=19.0s)]
*  maybe to offset some of those costs. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=23.8s)]
*  But on Friday, in a social media post, the president seemed to backtrack and back down, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=26.599999999999998s)]
*  acknowledging there could be some political fallout. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=31.4s)]
*  Writing on Truth Social, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=34.8s)]
*  in any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I'm okay if they do. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=36.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  Whatever that means. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=43.2s)]
*  Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=44.4s)]
*  He is the ranking member of the House Budget Committee and also serves on the Ways and Means Committee, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=48.2s)]
*  which writes the tax part of this bill. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=53.4s)]
*  Congressman Boyle, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=56.4s)]
*  My first question for you is how you think these negotiations and discussions on Tuesday [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=59.4s)]
*  will likely end up affecting programs like Medicaid and food stamps, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=69.4s)]
*  particularly since a lot of Republican voters, Trump voters, depend on them too. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=74.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=80.4s)]
*  First, I always call, Trump calls it the big beautiful bill, yeah, for billionaires. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=81.4s)]
*  They are going to experience the biggest tax cut in American history [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=86.4s)]
*  and part of the way the Republicans are paying for it is by delivering the biggest Medicaid cuts in American history, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=90.4s)]
*  $880 billion worth, combined with the biggest cuts to SNAP, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=98.4s)]
*  which is nutrition assistance programs in American history. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=103.4s)]
*  That still only gets them about 25% of the way toward fully paying for the bill. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=107.4s)]
*  The other 75% will mostly come from, surprise, surprise, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=112.4s)]
*  Republicans adding more to the national debt in order to pay for their deep tax cuts that we can't afford. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=117.4s)]
*  This is one of the most fiscally irresponsible bills in American history, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=124.4s)]
*  combined with the fact they will be doing real harm to the American people, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=129.4s)]
*  especially those who get their health care from Medicaid, the majority of whom live in red states. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=133.4s)]
*  Does that mean Democrats will be withholding their votes then? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=141.4s)]
*  That's probably the easiest question to answer. I like answering easy questions. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=146.4s)]
*  Not one Democrat voted for this in the first round when the first step of reconciliation passed the House a few weeks ago. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=150.4s)]
*  I can pretty confidently predict right here and now that not one Democrat will support this Republican-only effort [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=157.4s)]
*  to deliver these dramatic tax cuts for billionaires at the expense of mostly the working poor and middle-class Americans. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=165.4s)]
*  Let me ask a slightly harder version of Antonio's question then. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=173.4s)]
*  Congressman Boyle, you released a statement, I believe it was yesterday or the day before, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=178.4s)]
*  that sounded like it was criticizing Republicans for being willing to raise the debt limit in order to potentially make this bill go through, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=184.4s)]
*  but the debt limit needs to be raised no matter what, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Besant, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=194.4s)]
*  who said that we are going to hit our so-called X state this summer. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=199.4s)]
*  Are you critical of the Republicans for potentially being willing to raise the debt limit, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=203.4s)]
*  or are you saying that Democrats will not vote for that particular piece of legislation, again, raising the debt limit so we can pay our bills? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=210.4s)]
*  I'm happy to address this and clear up any misconceptions because there are a few things here. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=217.4s)]
*  First, I would draw a pretty clear distinction between preemptively voting to raise the debt ceiling [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=222.4s)]
*  in order to provide trillions of dollars worth of tax cuts preemptively for mostly the top 1% of Americans. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=228.4s)]
*  That's very different than raising the debt ceiling in order to pay for debt that Congress has already voted to accrue, oftentimes years in the past. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=236.4s)]
*  The second thing, though, is, as you may know, I'm the author of the Debt Ceiling Reform Act. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=245.4s)]
*  I believe we need a permanent resolution to the absolute insanity that is the debt ceiling. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=250.4s)]
*  Really, I mean, aside from Switzerland, no other country on earth actually even has this concept, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=256.4s)]
*  that Congress first votes to appropriate funds and then years later has a separate vote to decide that once the credit card bill is in, whether or not we'll pay for it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=262.4s)]
*  Congressman, let me, if I can, get your thoughts on this new post from Donald Trump on True Social, and feel free to pass on it if you're not aware, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=271.4s)]
*  but he just posted a short time ago that he's going to make a major announcement about pharmaceutical prices in this country. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=280.4s)]
*  I'm going to read a part of it. He says, I am pleased to announce that tomorrow morning in the White House at 9 a.m. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=286.4s)]
*  I'll be signing one of the most consequential executive orders in our country's history. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=291.4s)]
*  Prescription, drug and pharmaceutical prices will be reduced almost immediately by 30 to 80 percent. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=296.4s)]
*  I've got a lot of thoughts about this, but I just want to get your general reaction to him making this sudden and unexpected announcement on a Sunday evening. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=302.4s)]
*  Well, let's be clear. God created the Republican Party in order to deliver tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=311.4s)]
*  So I will take with many grains of salt the idea that Donald Trump is actually going to do something on drug prices. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=318.4s)]
*  Number two, let's not forget that for the first time in American history, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=324.4s)]
*  the ability of Medicare to be able to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs was because of Democrats doing it under Joe Biden and a Democratic Congress. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=329.4s)]
*  Republicans fought us every step of the way and are still opposed to that very concept. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=338.4s)]
*  Third and finally, I would just remind us most of these executive orders that Donald Trump has signed are de facto press releases that don't actually have the force of law. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=344.4s)]
*  So if he's actually really going to do something about bringing down the cost of prescription drugs, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=355.4s)]
*  whether they're through Medicare, Medicaid or the private market, you actually have to do that in terms of an act of Congress that is signed by the president. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=361.4s)]
*  Can I ask how Democrats are planning to respond to this news that this administration is preparing to accept a jumbo luxury jet in the coming days from the Qatari government? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=369.4s)]
*  I mean, what can actually be done here? I know people have already been talking about how unconstitutional this may be. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=382.4s)]
*  But realistically, like, where will the buck stop and what will Dems do in the face of what a lot of voters are starting to see as just sort of blatant and disrespectful corruption? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=388.4s)]
*  You know, I give Donald Trump credit. He is the greatest gift grifter in American history. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=397.4s)]
*  It is remarkable, not just the level of corruption of this presidency and in particular the last four months, but the fact that it is so open and so brazen. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=403.4s)]
*  I know that many people at this point might be numb to this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=413.4s)]
*  We can never allow ourselves to get numb. And even if polls show it's not the most, you know, it's not the issue that's top of mind for most voters. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=418.4s)]
*  I'm sorry, right and wrong still matter. We have to pursue this legally in the courts. We have to raise public awareness. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=427.4s)]
*  It is absolutely remarkable the record levels of corruption that we are seeing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=434.4s)]
*  Congressman Brendan Boyle, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=440.4s)]
*  I know a lot of voters, a lot of your constituents are going to be looking to see how the party responds. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU9bE9nWH4&t=443.4s)]
