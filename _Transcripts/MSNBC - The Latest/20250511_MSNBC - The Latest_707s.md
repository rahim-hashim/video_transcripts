# Eric Holder on Trump admin. response to Newark mayor arrest: 'They're trying to intimidate people'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c)
*  is Eric Holder, former attorney general of the United States under President Barack Obama. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Holder, you just heard from the mayor of Newark, New Jersey. Let's start with his case. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  The president's former personal lawyer, who is now the acting attorney general for the district [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=11.92s)]
*  in New Jersey, Alina Haber, confirmed Barack's arrest with a social media post in all caps, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=19.12s)]
*  stating, quote, no one is above the law. The arrest of an elected official is always a sensitive [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=26.8s)]
*  matter. What's your reaction to what the Trump Justice Department has done? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=32.8s)]
*  Well, I think what we saw the Trump Justice Department do yesterday is consistent with what [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=38.64s)]
*  they have been doing around the country. The arrest of that judge in Wisconsin, the attempts [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=43.68s)]
*  to consolidate power. You know, I saw Holman in that earlier piece talk about this is all about [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=49.68s)]
*  politics. No, this is all about power. The Trump administration wants to acquire power to do the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=54.24s)]
*  kinds of radical things that they have been doing on a whole variety of fronts, and certainly with [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=60.0s)]
*  regard to immigration enforcement. You know, as best I can tell, I've looked at the tapes now, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=65.12s)]
*  and I wasn't there, but I've certainly seen a lot of tapes. The arrest certainly was affected [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=70.48s)]
*  when the mayor was outside of the premises, outside of the property. And it's hard for me [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=75.28s)]
*  to understand how there was a trespass charge there. It also strikes me that he was one of a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=81.76s)]
*  group of people there, and he was the one who was picked to be arrested. I think they're trying to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  send a message. They're trying to intimidate people, and they're trying to use this intimidation to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=92.56s)]
*  consolidate their power. And as we see the tape here, there were three members of Congress there [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=97.28s)]
*  with him. Three Congress people were there. He was the one picked out and were arrested. They were [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  all standing together outside of the perimeter. Now, the same day, this is, I waited to ask you [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=109.36s)]
*  this, the same day that Trump D.O.J. was arresting the mayor of Newark, top White House advisor [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=116.24s)]
*  Stephen Miller said the administration was looking at ways to suspend due process for migrants, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=122.32s)]
*  claiming it was up to the courts whether they would be forced to invoke emergency powers [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=129.2s)]
*  to suspend habeas corpus. Some judges handling migrant cases have expressed concern this [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=135.12s)]
*  administration is already ignoring due process. What do you make of this extraordinary statement? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, it is an extraordinary statement, and it's an extremely troubling one. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=149.44s)]
*  The right of habeas corpus is in our constitution. The founders decided that this was something that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=153.44s)]
*  needed to be expressly set out as a right that people in the United States have to invoke [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  to revoke habeas corpus, to suspend habeas corpus. You need to have proof of an invasion [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=165.68s)]
*  and also an indication that public safety is at risk. I don't think you have an indication that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=172.0s)]
*  either of those two prongs of the test have been met. Stephen Miller is many things. He's not a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=178.0s)]
*  real good lawyer. If in fact he is a lawyer, I don't think he is, but he's also not a good [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=183.44s)]
*  reader of the constitution if he thinks that there is a basis for them to suspend habeas corpus. That [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=187.12s)]
*  has only happened, I think, four times in our history, once during the Civil War, the last time [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=192.16s)]
*  during the bombing of Pearl Harbor. So we're in a fundamentally different place than those [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  two other, those four other occasions. Now getting back to the Trump Justice [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=201.44s)]
*  Department, this week Trump named Fox News host Janine Pirro to be interim U.S. Attorney for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  Washington, D.C. The Fox News host who pushed 2020 election conspiracies replaces Ed Martin, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=212.4s)]
*  who before his tenure had represented January 6th defendants. Meantime, Trump's new FBI director [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=220.24s)]
*  Cash Patel showed up for a Senate budget hearing this week without a budget plan. According to NBC [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=229.28s)]
*  News, he's receiving director's briefing just twice a week and has been traveling the country [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=236.72s)]
*  attending sporting events with celebrities. You know how the Justice Department is supposed to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=243.12s)]
*  run. You ran it. What is happening with this one? Well, it's not reassuring to hear all these [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=248.64s)]
*  indications about what the FBI director is doing. I can tell you that every FBI director that I [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  worked with showed up at 8 30 every morning for a briefing on the national intelligence estimates [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=261.12s)]
*  that we received just that day to understand what was going on with regard to the threat situation [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  around the world and domestically as well. It's my understanding that Patel does not make all those [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=273.28s)]
*  meetings unless there were health reasons or somebody was out of town. Those meetings were [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=278.16s)]
*  held, as I said, every day at 8 30 at FBI headquarters. You know, these are not serious [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=282.88000000000005s)]
*  people. They are there for reasons of loyalty to the president, not because they are planning to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  do something that's good for our justice system and for the people of this nation. I mean, Ed Martin [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=296.8s)]
*  was an absurd pick as the interim U.S. attorney. The next pick, I think, is I can't imagine that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=302.64s)]
*  she there's a good basis for her confirmation. I mean, she had a career as a Westchester [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=314.08s)]
*  DA, but for the last 20 years or so, she has been a TV personality who has really spouted some pretty [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=320.0s)]
*  bizarre things. Apparently among those, she's an election denier. Now, I was the United States [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=326.96s)]
*  attorney for the District of Columbia. That's an extremely important job. It's the largest U.S. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=333.44s)]
*  attorney's office in the country. You need somebody there who is going to be a lawyer for the people [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=338.32s)]
*  and not an arm of the president. I think that Martin, as well as his potential successor, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  are people who see themselves as representatives of Donald Trump as opposed to enforcers of the law [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=349.84s)]
*  and people who want to protect due process. Now, you're on the front lines of the fight for [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=355.84s)]
*  democracy as chair of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. This week, we got good [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=362.0s)]
*  news out of Alabama where a panel of three federal judges ruled the state must maintain a voting [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=368.23999999999995s)]
*  rights act compliant congressional map. And in Florida, where a bill to require a proof of [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=376.08s)]
*  citizenship patterned after a Trump executive order failed to advance in the legislature. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=384.48s)]
*  However, there is real fear that bills similar to the Florida measure are gaining momentum [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=393.68s)]
*  in other states and that this Trump administration will continue to do what it can do to interfere [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=400.48s)]
*  with how elections are conducted. What's your level of concern about this right now? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=406.88s)]
*  Well, I'm very concerned. I'm really concerned about what I see at the Justice Department, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=413.52s)]
*  where the voting section in the Civil Rights Division has essentially been turned from [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=417.52s)]
*  protecting people and their right to vote to trying to find election fraud, which the Brennan [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=421.68s)]
*  Center has indicated. You're more likely to be hit by lightning than to cast a fraudulent in-person [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=428.0s)]
*  ballot. And nevertheless, they shifted all the Justice Department voting rights section personnel [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=434.8s)]
*  to that focus. And I'm concerned about what that means then in terms of what the Justice Department [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=441.44s)]
*  will do to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to cast a ballot. Then you see this [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=447.68s)]
*  executive order from the president where he tries to claim that he's going to change the whole [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=453.12s)]
*  electoral process in the states as well as in with regard to the federal elections. And the president [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=457.28s)]
*  simply doesn't have that power. States govern their own electoral processes and Congress is the prime [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=462.32s)]
*  determinant as to how federal elections are run. But I think they're doing all of this again. You [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=467.92s)]
*  have to look the through line through all of this stuff. The arrest of the mayor, what we're talking [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=473.36s)]
*  about now is the acquisition of power. That's what this is all about, power, the use of power, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=478.24s)]
*  and to try to put in place a more authoritarian regime than this nation has ever seen. And so all [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=484.08000000000004s)]
*  of us, they have to be prepared to fight against that which they are trying to do. If we're [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=490.16s)]
*  complacent, they will be allowed to do it. If we're silent, that will be seen as acquiescence. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=494.88s)]
*  So people need to do all that they can in any way that they can to oppose these moves. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=499.68s)]
*  Finally, in the next segment, I'm going to share my thoughts about Tyrese Nichols. Three Memphis [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  police officers charged with beating Nichols to death after traffic stop were acquitted of state [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=512.0s)]
*  charges this week by an out of town jury. Many of us see the officers' upcoming sentencing on [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=518.16s)]
*  federal convictions as a last chance for real justice. But this is happening as Trump is gutting [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=524.8s)]
*  the Justice Department Civil Rights Division that built the case against the officers during the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=531.92s)]
*  Biden administration, turning its core mission on its head by shifting focus to alleged anti-white [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=537.92s)]
*  and anti-Christian discrimination, not anti-civil rights discrimination for all people, including [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=546.64s)]
*  blacks and gays and Jews. And it operated in a robust fashion when you were attorney general. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=554.08s)]
*  What's your reaction to what is happening now with the Justice Department Civil Rights [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=561.2800000000001s)]
*  Division being changed in terms of its focus outright being stated, as I said, where their [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=567.5200000000001s)]
*  focus is moved to other areas? And you have a situation where there would not even be [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=574.32s)]
*  federal convictions on Tyrese Nichols had it not been a Civil Rights Division that was focused, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=580.16s)]
*  that included police abuse where they was found. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=586.8s)]
*  Yeah, I've often called the Civil Rights Division the crown jewel of the Justice [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=589.36s)]
*  Department. And if one looks at the origins of the Civil Rights Division and then the history [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=594.8s)]
*  of that division under Democratic as well as Republican presidents, this administration [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=600.64s)]
*  is doing things totally inconsistent, both with that history and with the origin of the division. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=606.48s)]
*  The focuses that they are placing, the emphases that they are trying to put in place are [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=613.44s)]
*  inconsistent with the way in which that division has always operated and I fear puts at risk [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=619.04s)]
*  vulnerable populations, those populations that are subject to all kinds of discrimination, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=624.64s)]
*  hate crimes, a whole variety of things that again, Republican as well as Democratic administrations [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=631.44s)]
*  have put emphases on and put resources behind. This administration, again, it's all about power [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=638.0s)]
*  and they want to make sure that those parts of the population that they think support them will get [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=645.9200000000001s)]
*  protection and those parts of the population that they think are not going to be supportive of them [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=653.5200000000001s)]
*  do not get that kind of protection. They're making very ideological determinations about what they're [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  going to do with the Civil Rights Division and again, that is not something that we've ever seen [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=663.76s)]
*  ever seen before. Attorney General Eric Holder, many thanks for sharing your analysis of the news [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=668.72s)]
*  with us and our viewers this hour. Thank you. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=675.76s)]
*  you [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3HG-KE29c&t=688.48s)]
