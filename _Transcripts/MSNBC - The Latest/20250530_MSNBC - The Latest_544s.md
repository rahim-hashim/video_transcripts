# RFK Jr. ‘cannot remain in office’ after MAHA report cited fake studies: Doctor
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU)
*  I want to bring in New York Times political reporter Maggie Astor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=0.0s)]
*  Kevin Madden was the presidential campaign advisor for Mitt Romney. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=3.84s)]
*  And here in studio with me, Dr. Erwin Redliner, co-founder of the Children's Health Fund, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  senior research scholar at Columbia University, and clinical professor of pediatrics at the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=11.64s)]
*  Albert Einstein College of Medicine. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=16.38s)]
*  Welcome to all of you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Maggie, tell us more about this report and the so-called evidence that it's based on. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=19.68s)]
*  So this report is a or was presented as a comprehensive look at children's health and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=26.32s)]
*  the causes of chronic health conditions among children. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=34.8s)]
*  And what we found yesterday, I should also say that it was the news organization, Notice, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=39.86s)]
*  that originally broke this story. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=47.6s)]
*  So they should get credit for breaking that story. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=50.06s)]
*  So what we found yesterday was that a number of the citations in this report either were riddled [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=53.24s)]
*  with errors. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=64.0s)]
*  For example, they listed the wrong author or the wrong title or some such. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=65.0s)]
*  And some of them were just fabricated altogether. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=74.08s)]
*  They didn't exist. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=77.22s)]
*  They had the title of the paper. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=78.72s)]
*  They listed a journal name. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=81.76s)]
*  They listed a date. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=83.16s)]
*  They listed an author. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=84.16s)]
*  And no such paper existed. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=85.16s)]
*  So the presence of these fabricated citations in the report obviously raises questions, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=88.16s)]
*  according to the experts that we talked to, about the credibility of the report's findings. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  And certainly the researchers whose names were cited in the report attached to papers that they [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=103.36s)]
*  didn't write are very concerned about their names and reputations being used that way [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=110.28s)]
*  and what it says about the underlying validity of the citations in the report. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=117.88s)]
*  So just to be clear, in short, there are entire papers that are cited that never existed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  They certainly didn't exist in the journal they said, on the date they said, in the way [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=131.8s)]
*  they said. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=135.12s)]
*  In addition to that, names of real people, maybe serious people, were used for things [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=136.96s)]
*  that they didn't do. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  Is that basically the bottom line here? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=144.84s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=147.76s)]
*  We spoke and NoDIS spoke as well to a number of researchers whose names were listed in [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=149.0s)]
*  the bibliography of this report, saying, I'll give an example from our article, Katherine [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  Keys, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=163.84s)]
*  She was listed as the author of a paper about mental health and substance use among adolescents. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=167.88s)]
*  And that paper that was cited in the report didn't exist. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=174.0s)]
*  She spoke to my colleague, Danny Bloom, who is my co-author on this article, and said [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  she did not write any paper by the title that the report cited, and nor does a paper by [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=183.4s)]
*  that title seem to exist by any author. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=190.72s)]
*  And that's just one example. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  There are others. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  Such good reporting and important reporting. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  So doctor, you've been working in healthcare about 50 years. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  You have an international reputation in children's health. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=201.8s)]
*  Press secretary Caroline Lovett says these issues with the report, issues things like [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=205.96s)]
*  formatting, shouldn't invalidate the findings themselves. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=215.56s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=216.56s)]
*  Well, Chris, let's move away from the technical issues of actually a misinformed lying document [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=217.88s)]
*  that was put out by the secretary of HHS. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=227.68s)]
*  And yeah, they lied about it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=231.52s)]
*  They fabricated citations. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=233.36s)]
*  But at the end of the day, R.F. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=235.4s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. is using this fabricated information to create policies and recommendations that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=237.28s)]
*  affect the health of children. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=244.44s)]
*  Millions and millions of lives will be affected by the nonsense that they put out in that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=248.0s)]
*  report. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=253.8s)]
*  It's really unconscionable. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=254.8s)]
*  It's just really, it's hard to believe. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=255.8s)]
*  And I do think that people need to focus on what this means. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=258.2s)]
*  And what it means to me is a reinforcement of what we felt from the beginning when R.F. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=261.92s)]
*  K. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=267.72s)]
*  Jr. was originally suggested as a potential nominee for secretary of HHS. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=268.72s)]
*  He's unqualified. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=273.44s)]
*  He's unscientific. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=274.44s)]
*  And he's promoting crazy ideas that are bad for America's children. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=276.32s)]
*  And don't forget, he has the biggest public health platform and megaphone of any human [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=281.64s)]
*  being on the planet, Chris. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=288.04s)]
*  And this is what we have to deal with now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=289.68s)]
*  You know, if he was working as an academic researcher at any kind of medical school, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=292.52s)]
*  for example, and put this out, he would have been fired. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=298.76s)]
*  Fired. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=302.36s)]
*  And I think the senators who approved this confirmation and the medical organizations [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=303.44s)]
*  that remain silent need to now call for his resignation. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=308.79999999999995s)]
*  He cannot remain in that office using misstated data and really dishonest data to drive critical [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=312.9s)]
*  public health policy that will affect children. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  I want to give you a chance to punctuate that because most people don't know the way that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  this works. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  You're a doctor in a pediatric office. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=329.35999999999996s)]
*  You have hundreds of patients. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=331.36s)]
*  To what extent are you relying on this kind of publication and the information that it [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=333.6s)]
*  cites to help guide and update your understanding as a physician of how you should treat and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=341.0s)]
*  make recommendations to children's families? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=347.92s)]
*  Well, of course. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=350.88s)]
*  And first of all, you know, take the issue of childhood vaccinations, childhood immunizations, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=352.36s)]
*  which have been proven to be safe, effective, saving lives for decades of children who otherwise [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=358.24s)]
*  in the past would have been dying from diseases like measles and polio and so on. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  And here we have the head of Health and Human Services saying, well, we're not so sure. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  We need more information. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=376.24s)]
*  So that means... [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  Don't come to me for medical advice. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=380.32s)]
*  We're sitting in our office. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=381.32s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=382.32s)]
*  Well, doctors, should we get our kid vaccinated? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=384.32s)]
*  And I'm saying, yeah, you should. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=388.36s)]
*  But what about this report that I just read from the secretary of HHS? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=390.62s)]
*  We have to say, no, that was absolutely incorrect. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  But people are already skeptical about medical information. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  And this is just exacerbating a terrible situation for practicing pediatricians and frankly [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=403.24s)]
*  for families too, Chris. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=409.92s)]
*  So Kevin, you are an expert in communications. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=411.92s)]
*  The White House defended the report, downplayed these citation issues and said future questions [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=414.16s)]
*  should go to HHS, which at least as earlier today did not respond in any thorough way. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=419.48s)]
*  Are untruths so baked in that for the voting public it doesn't matter? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  Or how do you view this? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=431.54s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think anytime the White House defers to an agency or a cabinet office, that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=433.12s)]
*  means they really want no part of it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=439.16s)]
*  And I think they do recognize this. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=441.08s)]
*  The scrutiny here is pretty real. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=442.88s)]
*  I mean, look, first of all, this was not a report that was in any way routine. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=444.24s)]
*  Secretary Kennedy and others in the MAHA sort of supportive movement that he's put together [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=449.48s)]
*  have been anticipating this and hyping it for a pretty long time. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=454.18s)]
*  So the fact that there were these mistakes and these citation issues that undermined [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=458.48s)]
*  it, you know, that's a very big, I think, internal problem that they're going to have. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=462.32s)]
*  The other part of it is they've always based their advocacy on what they said was evidence-based [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=467.32s)]
*  advocacy. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=472.92s)]
*  So when the evidence then becomes under this level of scrutiny that they had to expect, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=474.06s)]
*  given that they were hyping it, I think it really does demonstrate that it's an unforced [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=479.08s)]
*  error. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=483.36s)]
*  The one thing I think Carolyn Levitt's doing as a communicator here is she believes that [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=484.36s)]
*  the MAHA movement that is very supportive of Secretary Kennedy, very supportive of the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=488.92s)]
*  grassroots movement that is not necessarily going to defer to scientific journal recommendations, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=494.14s)]
*  but instead they firmly believe that these issues, that somebody's finally speaking about [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=500.41999999999996s)]
*  chronic illnesses in a different way than many of the academics or establishment had, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=506.62s)]
*  and she's trying to speak directly to them. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=510.62s)]
*  But if you're going to win that debate, you still have to win the larger, big middle of [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=512.86s)]
*  the American public, and they do believe in having conversations and debates that are [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=516.46s)]
*  rooted in some sort of scientific authority. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvgzDvCSLaU&t=521.02s)]
