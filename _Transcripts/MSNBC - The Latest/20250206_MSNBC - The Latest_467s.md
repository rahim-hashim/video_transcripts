# 'Beyond any words': Former hostage Aviva Siegel gives first interview after husband is freed
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0)
*  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on Capitol Hill at this hour, just days [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=0.0s)]
*  after Hamas released the first American Israeli hostage in more than a year. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=4.88s)]
*  After 484 days in captivity, Keith Siegel, 65 years old, was freed on Saturday, surrounded [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=9.72s)]
*  by members of Hamas at first, before he was turned over, giving a wave to the crowd. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=16.36s)]
*  This was a day that his family and his friends had been waiting for for 15 months, especially [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=22.16s)]
*  his wife Aviva, who was also a hostage, until last November, for more than 50 days. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=27.68s)]
*  She was released without him in November of 2023, was finally able to welcome him home. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=34.32s)]
*  And Aviva Siegel joins me now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=40.36s)]
*  Aviva, it's so wonderful to see you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  First of all, how is it having Keith home? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=45.32s)]
*  Well, you know, it's I breathe differently, I feel differently. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  I feel like a different person. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=55.72s)]
*  I just can't tell everybody how stressed I was for a year and two months coming back [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=58.36s)]
*  from captivity and leaving Keith there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=64.16s)]
*  Was the worst thing that could ever happen to me. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=67.52s)]
*  And I'm just so, so happy to have him back. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=71.0s)]
*  I want to say that when Keith came back the first day, he looked terrible. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  He's lost so much weight and he really looked pale, sick. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=80.08000000000001s)]
*  And we with him, we're hugging him, loving him. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=85.84s)]
*  And he looks different and he's getting stronger. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=89.0s)]
*  And we love it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=92.0s)]
*  I wanted to ask you because I saw him looking so thin when he came out on Saturday and being [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  welcomed, of course, and embraced by you and your wonderful daughters. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=101.84s)]
*  And then I saw an interview that we did in Tel Aviv yesterday with his brother, Lee. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=105.24s)]
*  But how is he doing physically and mentally? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  You know, he's in a shock. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=116.28s)]
*  We all in a shock. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=117.28s)]
*  And he's completely in a shock, not understanding exactly that he's here already. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=119.6s)]
*  And I can understand that being in Gaza for so long, for so many days and so many minutes [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=128.16s)]
*  and just wanting to come back, not knowing if he'll ever survive and come back alive. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=137.32s)]
*  And now he's here with us, hugging us, eating with us. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=143.84s)]
*  And it's just beyond any word saying how happy he is and how happy we are. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=148.52s)]
*  And I just want to say that having Keith Holm and hearing the stories of what he went through [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  in captivity makes me even stronger, shouting for the hostages that are still there, that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=162.76s)]
*  we cannot forget, that I think about, that the families think about, that the country [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  thinks about. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  And I just want to remind everybody that the Palestinians in Gaza have rights. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  The hostages that are still in Gaza need to get their rights back because they have hearts [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=184.44s)]
*  and they feel, and I just hope that they don't feel that they've been forgotten. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  We need them back as soon as possible. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  We need them back alive. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=197.6s)]
*  I've been talking to Ruby Khen and the Nutris and, you know, Jonathan Zaghi Khen, Zaghi's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  father, rather, Jonathan Zaghi Khen, and these other families, and they're desperate, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=210.0s)]
*  but they are so happy for you, so happy that Keith is out. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=215.6s)]
*  Ilan Alexander also still being held. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=221.72s)]
*  What did he tell you about the way he was treated by Hamas? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=224.72s)]
*  First of all, I want to say that all the families of the hostages, the ones that are alive and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=229.2s)]
*  the ones that aren't alive, I want them to feel free like I feel today. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  I want them to feel the love that they have for this world. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=238.56s)]
*  And until they won't get their hostages back, they won't feel like I feel, and they deserve [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  to feel like that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, Keith is getting stronger. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=249.72s)]
*  Every minute I feel that he's a little bit better, but he's still in hospital, and we're [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=253.16000000000003s)]
*  going to look after him, and he's going to have lots of tests to do, and we're going [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=258.6s)]
*  to do everything that we can to make him feel like he's back in a decent world, in a world [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=263.72s)]
*  that can see him as a human being. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=269.88s)]
*  Was he afraid for his life? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=274.68s)]
*  Was he threatened? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=276.56s)]
*  He was threatened so many times. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=279.3s)]
*  He wasn't treated like a human being should be treated, and he went through so much of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=281.04s)]
*  hell, of Hamas terrorists that didn't even see him as a person. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=286.44s)]
*  And he needs, everybody needs to understand that all the hostages that are still there [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=293.56s)]
*  are going through what he went through, and it's just impossible for me to understand [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  that it's taking so long. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  They're not even talking about deal number two. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=306.92s)]
*  They should talk about everybody coming home now. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=309.2s)]
*  So I'm begging, I'm begging Trump, and I want to thank Trump for Keith coming home, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=313.6s)]
*  and I want to thank him for understanding that it's not human for any person to be in [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=320.0s)]
*  Gaza as a hostage by the way they treated, like I was treated, and for him to understand [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=326.24s)]
*  how important it is to get them all out, and we need to push and scream and get them all [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=334.56s)]
*  out. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  This is the most important thing for this world. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=341.4s)]
*  This world needs to understand that nobody should suffer like they're suffering. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=345.64s)]
*  You traveled all over the world urging anyone who would listen to help bring Keith and the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=353.08s)]
*  other hostages home. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=357.67999999999995s)]
*  So your message to the negotiators, the Qataris, President Trump, Steve Witkoff, who's been, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=359.56s)]
*  who's actually gone to Gaza and has been working so hard on this, your message about how important [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=368.91999999999996s)]
*  this is, the Egyptians and the others. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=374.11999999999995s)]
*  Yes, for sure. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=377.2s)]
*  Listening to Keith and hearing what he went through. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=380.32s)]
*  Keith is 65 years old, and what he went through is beyond anybody to understand what he went [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=382.64s)]
*  through, and we can't, we can't, we cannot let them stay there. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=391.28s)]
*  We just can't. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=396.44s)]
*  We have to get them out. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=397.48s)]
*  And I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for listening to me so many times [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=399.04s)]
*  in the MNBC, and it's because you're just such a sensitive person and understanding [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=405.48s)]
*  that this world needs to be a better world. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=413.72s)]
*  So I want to thank you so much for that, for being so kind for Israel, so kind to my family [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=415.76s)]
*  and helping bringing Keith home. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=422.58s)]
*  Well, Aviva, it's your courage and your family's courage, your incredible daughters, that I [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  applaud, and knowing you and continuing to know you in the future is a great privilege [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  for me. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=439.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  It's an honor to be here with you today. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=441.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNvDZ_opz0&t=446.03999999999996s)]
