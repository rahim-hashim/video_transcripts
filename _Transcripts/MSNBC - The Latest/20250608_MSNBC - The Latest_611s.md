# Hyenas fighting over a carcass: Michael Cohen on the split between Musk and Trump
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA)
*  President Trump's falling out with Elon Musk certainly seemed inevitable given its transactional [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=0.0s)]
*  nature and it also falls into a pretty clear pattern. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=5.28s)]
*  The president took a blowtorch to his burned bridge with Musk in an interview with NBC's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=9.8s)]
*  Kristen Welker. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Trump said his billionaire frenemy was quote, very disrespectful to the office of the president. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=16.76s)]
*  And he added that he assumed their relationship was over. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=23.02s)]
*  It's Trump's signature move of hiring the best people and then trashing them on their [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=26.96s)]
*  way out. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=32.44s)]
*  According to the New York Times, the implosion began just moments after Musk's Oval Office [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=33.6s)]
*  farewell last week when as soon as the cameras left, Trump confronted Musk over political [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=38.92s)]
*  donations to Democrats by his nominee to run NASA, Jared Isaacman, who is a Musk associate. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=45.900000000000006s)]
*  The feud has now escalated to include Musk calling for Trump's impeachment in a tweet [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=55.44s)]
*  which he later took down and the president threatening to cancel federal contracts with [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=61.46s)]
*  Musk's companies. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  And that's just part of the drama. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=68.16s)]
*  According to the New York Times, after Trump was briefed on a Times article about Musk's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=70.72s)]
*  alleged drug use during the campaign, Trump told associates that Musk's quote, crazy behavior [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=75.8s)]
*  was linked to drug use. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=84.82s)]
*  Joining us now is someone who knows Trump's pattern very well. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=88.22s)]
*  Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney and principal at CrisisX. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=92.61999999999999s)]
*  He's also the host of the May Oculpa podcast, co-host of the political beat down podcast [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=97.41999999999999s)]
*  and sub stack host and creator of the real Michael Cohen. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=103.66s)]
*  Michael, it's been a long time since we've seen each other. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=108.33999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for coming to the weekend. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  Good to see you, Jonathan. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=113.42s)]
*  So your perspective on the Musk-Trump breakup and also the role loyalty plays, because you [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=114.94s)]
*  of all people know when it comes to Donald Trump, loyalty is a one way street. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=123.62s)]
*  Yeah, well, I've said that many, many a time that he's like First Avenue here in New York [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=128.02s)]
*  City, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=132.94s)]
*  One way. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=133.94s)]
*  This was never going to go well. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=135.12s)]
*  I think you and I have spoken about this, I don't know, eight months ago when I said [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=137.02s)]
*  that bromance is never going to last. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=141.82s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  Because you're talking about two massive egos. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  I kind of compared them the other day in one of my sub stacks to two sort of amped up hyenas [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  fighting over the carcass, pulling it out of the dirt, figuring out which one is going [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  to eat more versus less. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=158.78s)]
*  I mean, that's really the scenario that we're sitting with right now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=160.34s)]
*  And sadly, sadly for Elon Musk, he didn't take the hint when I was so vocal about it, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=165.66s)]
*  because as rich as he is, you're never richer than the government and you're certainly never [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=171.89999999999998s)]
*  more powerful than the president. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=176.98s)]
*  But Michael, do you think that the president may have met his match a little bit with Elon [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=179.77999999999997s)]
*  Musk? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=184.22s)]
*  I mean, you know, him talking about Epstein so quickly, so getting it so personal, both [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=185.22s)]
*  of them are probably equally unpredictable, equally petty, equally rich, or at least the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=189.46s)]
*  Musk wins that one at the end of the day. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=196.06s)]
*  Do you think that the president has met his match with Elon Musk when it comes to that? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=199.22s)]
*  They both have social media platforms. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=203.54000000000002s)]
*  The problem with Elon Musk is, first again, you're never as rich as the United States [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  government, which Trump has now full and total control over, including the weaponization [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=209.66s)]
*  of the Department of Justice, something I know a lot about. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=215.02s)]
*  Second, you're never more powerful than the president. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=219.1s)]
*  The problem for Elon Musk is he doesn't understand this political guerrilla warfare. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=222.18s)]
*  If he wants, I'm more than happy to walk him through it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=227.54s)]
*  There is a way that he could, let's just say, elevate himself, but you can't beat the president [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=230.34s)]
*  of the United States, because just as soon as he starts losing, he has the ability to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=235.62s)]
*  change the rules. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=240.94s)]
*  Like, look at what he's doing now in Los Angeles by basically turning around, taking over the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=241.94s)]
*  National Guard and sending them into the streets against civilians for what? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=248.14000000000001s)]
*  Putting up slogans and banners? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=254.06s)]
*  When does that become a national security threat? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=256.9s)]
*  But Elon Musk is a provider of national security services that no other company is able to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=259.54s)]
*  do. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=266.18s)]
*  He simply has unparalleled technical skill that the U.S. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=267.18s)]
*  government wants, and it would impact us negatively if he decided to pull that support. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=270.7s)]
*  Granted, he wants to keep the billions flowing, but he also has the power of his purse when [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=275.86s)]
*  it comes to political campaigns, as we saw last cycle. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=280.5s)]
*  And so Donald Trump has threatened Elon Musk. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=284.06s)]
*  He said there would be consequences if he decided to support Democrats in the midterms. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=287.74s)]
*  What do you make of how real that threat is? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=293.74s)]
*  So the threat is actually real by Trump. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=296.18s)]
*  You start talking to people like Steve Bannon. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=298.46000000000004s)]
*  And I call this as well. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=301.14s)]
*  When I had said that Trump was going to pull a Mohammed bin Salman on Elon Musk, and I [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=302.38s)]
*  said this like six, seven months ago, you're going to take his money, they're going to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=307.7s)]
*  shutter his businesses. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=311.26s)]
*  So take, for example, space. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=313.46s)]
*  Do you think Trump will actually take over like Steve Bannon has suggested to nationalize [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=315.34s)]
*  space? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=321.34s)]
*  Well, it's going to be difficult, right? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=322.34s)]
*  But we do have NASA, right? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=324.44s)]
*  All of a sudden, SpaceX has become our NASA. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=326.54s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=329.18s)]
*  But Steve Bannon is calling for the nationalization of SpaceX. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=330.38s)]
*  This is a problem because this is how they're thinking. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=334.14s)]
*  Again, this is all political guerrilla warfare. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=337.14s)]
*  Hey, Michael, you mentioned Steve Bannon. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=341.5s)]
*  So let's play some of that sound of Steve Bannon talking about Elon Musk, SpaceX, and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=344.3s)]
*  what he thinks should happen to Elon Musk. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=349.74s)]
*  The acts that President Trump should be taking immediately, I think, when he threatens to [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=354.5s)]
*  take one of the big programs out of SpaceX, President Trump tonight should sign an executive [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=358.74s)]
*  order calling for the Defense to Production Act to be called in SpaceX and seize SpaceX [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=365.34000000000003s)]
*  tonight before midnight. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=372.78000000000003s)]
*  The US government should seize it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=374.90000000000003s)]
*  They got to go back to this as Stuart Stevens talked about and go through everything about [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=376.34000000000003s)]
*  his immigration status. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=380.62s)]
*  I happen to believe, given the facts that I've been shown, that he's an illegal alien, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=382.22s)]
*  an illegal alien has got to be deported. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=386.94s)]
*  I mean, that's some fire coming from Steve Bannon. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=389.94s)]
*  But the question is, would Donald Trump actually follow Steve Bannon's advice? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=393.94s)]
*  Well, there is a reason why Steve Bannon is nowhere near the White House. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=400.62s)]
*  The guy is crazy. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=404.5s)]
*  But to go ahead and to enact that antiquated policy, we have to be at war for that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=406.58s)]
*  So where he's calculating that we're at war, because there's a fight going on between [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=415.82s)]
*  Elon Musk verbally on his ex and on Trump's social, I'm not really sure that that constitutes [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=421.34s)]
*  the war that Steve Bannon is talking about. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=427.7s)]
*  Michael, really quickly, in the time that we have left, you were on the weekend prime [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=430.42s)]
*  and said that you would, I think, selfishly accept a pardon from President Trump. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=435.7s)]
*  In the past, you've called him a racist, a con man, and a cheat. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=441.3s)]
*  Do you really believe that he would, at the end of the day, someone like that that you [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=445.26000000000005s)]
*  described would give you a pardon and you would accept it? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=449.18s)]
*  So let me correct you on this, because I don't suspect you actually read the letter. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=451.90000000000003s)]
*  The letter is, while it gives me the benefit of the pardon, it's really for the benefit [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=457.90000000000003s)]
*  of 70 million Americans. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=463.22s)]
*  I'm not talking about the letter. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=464.94000000000005s)]
*  I'm talking about what you said on Tecafidntrap. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=467.5s)]
*  In the letter, it's the op-ed that was drafted by myself and Jesse Jackson Jr. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=470.18s)]
*  Renee, can we play the sound from the weekend prime time, from last weekend, please? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=475.22s)]
*  If Trump were to have a change of heart, would you accept a pardon from him? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=483.78000000000003s)]
*  You know, selfishly, I would, simply because it would make my life a little easier, going [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=487.94000000000005s)]
*  back into real estate, dealing with banks and so on. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=495.38s)]
*  I owe no money. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=498.1s)]
*  I had, it was nonviolent. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=498.82000000000005s)]
*  Why should I be a felon for life? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=500.66s)]
*  That's not the way the system should work. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=502.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=506.9s)]
*  That's what I'm referring to. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=507.14s)]
*  I understood. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=507.7s)]
*  But if you continue to play it further, I explain that there's 70 million Americans [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=508.42s)]
*  similarly situated to myself. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=513.86s)]
*  By the way, the president himself as well, with the felony conviction that after you [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=515.22s)]
*  do your time, so long as you have resolved all of your issues, I have no restitution [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=520.34s)]
*  or anything, that the sentence that was imposed upon me should not be a sentence for life. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=526.1s)]
*  It's not a life sentence. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=531.94s)]
*  And that was the point that I was making. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=533.3800000000001s)]
*  And that's what I basically talk about in this pardon application. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=535.1400000000001s)]
*  And I do not believe that the folks that were surrounding Joe Biden actually looked at the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=538.98s)]
*  document, which took me five months to prepare. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=545.1400000000001s)]
*  I have seven, seven letters of support from significant people, two members of Congress [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=547.7800000000001s)]
*  and ethics czar. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=553.62s)]
*  I have the two leading constitutional law professors in America and two historical [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=554.82s)]
*  Watergate attorneys as well, all pushing for it because, look, to be fair, my conviction [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=560.18s)]
*  was predicated off of Trump getting his pecker pulled by a porn star. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=567.14s)]
*  So do you think there's any chance in hell Donald Trump will pardon you? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=572.18s)]
*  Well, listen, it would be very helpful to him as well. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=575.38s)]
*  If he's looking for that Nobel Peace Prize, imagine you're helping 70 million Americans. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=578.3399999999999s)]
*  70 million Americans would have their lives changed by an executive order put forth by Trump. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=584.26s)]
*  Michael Cohen, thank you. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YopeKZQ0vaA&t=589.78s)]
