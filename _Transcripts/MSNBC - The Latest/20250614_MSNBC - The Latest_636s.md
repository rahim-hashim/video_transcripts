# Should Trump’s military politicization alarm Americans? National security experts weigh in
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ)
*  The crowd would have showed up for Biden. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong. In Los Angeles, the governor of California, the mayor of Los Angeles, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=6.0s)]
*  they're incompetent. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=18.0s)]
*  That was a snapshot of President Trump's speech at Fort Bragg in North Carolina this week, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=21.0s)]
*  where the president criticized the press, California lawmakers, and protesters, as well as transgender Americans. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=26.0s)]
*  His speech is now causing new concerns about the politicization of the military after uniformed soldiers cheered and booed [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=33.0s)]
*  in reaction to the president's political statements, which is traditionally frowned upon and could violate military regulations. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=41.0s)]
*  This all comes as the Trump administration officials warn that the president is preparing to send National Guard troops into more US cities [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=49.0s)]
*  if ICE protests expand beyond Los Angeles. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=57.0s)]
*  As the Washington Post puts it, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=61.0s)]
*  this potentially opens the door to the use of military force that is the most extensive on American soil in US history. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=75.0s)]
*  Joining us now to discuss are retired Army General Steph Twitty, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=84.0s)]
*  an MSNBC analyst and the former deputy commander of the United States European Command, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=89.0s)]
*  retired Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Rob Amico, who is also a FBI special agent, retired, of course, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=95.0s)]
*  and Nancy Youssef, National Security Correspondent for the Wall Street Journal. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=103.0s)]
*  Okay, we have a little bit to discuss. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=108.0s)]
*  Was that jarring, Rob, when you saw the cheers at Fort Bragg? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=111.0s)]
*  I cannot think of any presidential address that I ever worked on with President Bush back in those days [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=117.0s)]
*  where military personnel were encouraged to be political. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=124.0s)]
*  It definitely was new. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=128.0s)]
*  And the unfortunate thing is when you're young in the Army, you're a pleaser. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=130.0s)]
*  You want to do well. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=134.0s)]
*  So you kind of go with what leadership is doing. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=135.0s)]
*  And he's the ultimate leader of the military. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=138.0s)]
*  So you're out there and you don't really understand the real ramifications of what that looks like on TV because it just looks bad. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=140.0s)]
*  So he's used to show on TV. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=148.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, the young troops aren't there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=151.0s)]
*  You know, they just want to please their commanders. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=154.0s)]
*  They want to do well. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=156.0s)]
*  They want to get promoted. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=157.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, it just has a very bad look. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=158.0s)]
*  Lieutenant General Twitty, you know, I want to pull up this military.com article that said Bragg soldiers who cheered Trump's political attacks while in uniform were checked for allegiance appearance. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=160.0s)]
*  Internal 82nd Airborne Division, which my father was in twice because we were there twice when he was in the Army, reviewed by military.com, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=171.0s)]
*  The troops ultimately selected to be behind Trump invisible to the cameras were almost exclusively male. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=179.0s)]
*  One unit level message bluntly said no fat soldiers. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=194.0s)]
*  They also didn't want anyone who felt like they didn't agree with the Trump administration because they didn't want people rolling their eyes behind the president. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=198.0s)]
*  General, the politicization of the military feels like something that is bad. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=207.0s)]
*  I'm old enough to know that that was something that didn't happen. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=212.0s)]
*  When we when my father was in the Army, his political views when he left the House, they stopped there. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=215.0s)]
*  They stopped at the door. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=221.0s)]
*  That doesn't seem how Donald Trump wants his military to operate now, though. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=222.0s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. It's good to be with you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=228.0s)]
*  Based on the stuff that you just talked about that came out of military.com, I would agree. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=230.0s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=236.0s)]
*  It is not the way we acted in military. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=237.0s)]
*  We're nonpartisan. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=240.0s)]
*  We're a political. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=241.0s)]
*  We stand for the Constitution. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=244.0s)]
*  We stand for all the people in America. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=246.0s)]
*  And so I don't condone any of it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=249.0s)]
*  But I go back to Rob's comments that he just made. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=252.0s)]
*  What you're dealing with are young soldiers and you have a president that's that's very, very entertaining when he get in public and so forth. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=255.0s)]
*  And our soldiers being young, they're mimicking the commander in chief. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=269.0s)]
*  They're mimicking their president. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=274.0s)]
*  What I can tell you is in many cases, these soldiers really do not know the the UCMJ or how to react and things like this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=277.0s)]
*  And I can guarantee you many of the senior leaders probably police this up afterwards. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=290.0s)]
*  And so don't take this as if, OK, these soldiers are going to side with the president for some insurrection or something like this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=296.0s)]
*  I spent 40 years in the army. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=306.0s)]
*  I will tell you right now we have a professional military that abides by the Constitution. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=309.0s)]
*  And in my view, the American people, they have nothing to worry about when it comes to whether our soldiers going to have allegiance to our Constitution or have allegiance to the president. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=316.0s)]
*  And so point blank, we're here for the country. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=332.0s)]
*  And so, Nancy, that is a perfect segue to the question I wanted to ask you based on the story that you wrote for the for the Wall Street Journal on display at the DC's parade tanks, drones and the military's identity crisis. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=337.0s)]
*  And I would quote from from your story that you co-wrote with Aaron Zittner. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=352.0s)]
*  Perhaps the most endangered asset that will be on display Saturday is the U.S. military's longtime status as an apolitical institution, one that serves the Constitution and the country rather than the interests of the president or a general. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=356.0s)]
*  Now, we just heard General Twitty say that we shouldn't worry about particularly the army putting the putting a president above the Constitution. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=370.0s)]
*  But inside the Pentagon, are there worries that that is indeed what's happening, given the commander in chief who's there now? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=381.0s)]
*  You know, this is a consequential week. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=388.0s)]
*  We had U.S. federalized troops deployed on American streets, which in and of itself doesn't politicize the military. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=390.0s)]
*  But when they're accompanying ICE agents on raids, it moves them one step closer. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=398.0s)]
*  In addition, what we saw in Fort Bragg and now the military parade. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=404.0s)]
*  So it is an apolitical military. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=407.0s)]
*  But we're moving what we this week. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=409.0s)]
*  I think we move one step away from that a little bit with these series of events. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=411.0s)]
*  And so what we're trying to raise in that piece, and I think we're asking at the we're hearing asked at the Pentagon, is how do you sustain an apolitical military? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=415.0s)]
*  Because it doesn't, I think, go away in one day. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=423.0s)]
*  I think it's a series of events and it's so critical to the to the force. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=426.0s)]
*  Those troops at Fort Bragg were briefed beforehand about the need to not show their political allegiance. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=430.0s)]
*  They were briefed. They were briefed. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=436.0s)]
*  Now, to your points earlier, you know, we've never had a president bring such a political tone to the to the base. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=438.0s)]
*  There was always an understanding that to not put them in that position. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=447.0s)]
*  So in that regard, it was they were in a difficult position. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=450.0s)]
*  But when you see troops putting on MAGA hats over their berets, putting on MAGA necklaces in uniform and it's not sort of forcefully addressed by the generals publicly. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=453.0s)]
*  We saw a few comments here and there. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=464.0s)]
*  I think there is some concern. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=466.0s)]
*  I will tell you, I was talking to a Marine this week and he said, I sign up to go after enemies, the United States, not citizens, the United States. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=467.0s)]
*  And I was in the Pentagon when the Fort Bragg speech happened. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=476.0s)]
*  And certainly for their older generally in the Pentagon, there was a shock of what was happening because I think good order and discipline begins with sort of while while they're young and they were put in a difficult position, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=480.0s)]
*  understanding their responsibility to to that oath and to sort of honoring the fact that they represent all Americans. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=492.0s)]
*  And you brought up those Marines, the Marines in Los Angeles. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=499.0s)]
*  I want to start with Lieutenant Colonel with you on that. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=502.0s)]
*  The idea that they're there, they're there, right. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=505.0s)]
*  They're doing what they're doing. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=508.0s)]
*  We saw them arrest someone who is a veteran himself. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=509.0s)]
*  He was at the VA. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=512.0s)]
*  Talk about the training that they have in these spaces, right, because these are people who are trained to go overseas and they get training on how to deal with civilian populations. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=514.0s)]
*  But it's different when you're dealing with, I would assume, the citizens of your own nation. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=525.0s)]
*  I think it does. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=529.0s)]
*  It is going to be shocking for them when they're looking at the civilians, because they do do riot control, crowd control for like if the embassy is taken over and they can do that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=530.0s)]
*  So they and they did some training this week. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=539.0s)]
*  But I think when you are actually standing on the other side and you're in the street and you have an M4 that's loaded, that's locked and loaded, and you're basically a couple and a half pounds from making a decision that could change history. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=542.0s)]
*  I think that's a lot to put on them. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=554.0s)]
*  You know, when I first got my platoon, I had probably eight or nine Marines that weren't even U.S. citizens. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=556.0s)]
*  They had their green cards. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=564.0s)]
*  And I didn't even know at the time you can do that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=565.0s)]
*  So you may have Marines in this unit that are looking across and seeing that they were immigrants, too, that they got here. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=567.0s)]
*  And I think those are really tough decisions at that point. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=575.0s)]
*  Now, training kicks over and that's what you hope happens. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=578.0s)]
*  Like muscle memory and how you do things. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=581.0s)]
*  But the training was this week. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=583.0s)]
*  It was not a lot of muscle memory. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=584.0s)]
*  It's not. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=587.0s)]
*  But hopefully the senior, the NCOs and the platoon commanders and the senior staff really are drilling it into them. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=588.0s)]
*  And when there's downtime, they're going through this and they're going over and over. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=595.0s)]
*  I mean, you memorize all your general orders and you can get there. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=599.0s)]
*  But I think it is really going to be shocking to look across and then see your citizens that are there. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=603.0s)]
*  Some of them may have been in the same situation you were, like I said, and you have an M4 that's locked and loaded. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=609.0s)]
*  And I think that's a really good thing. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=618.0s)]
*  I think that's a really good thing. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=619.0s)]
*  I think that's a really good thing. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=620.0s)]
*  I think that's a really good thing. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=621.0s)]
*  I think that's a really good thing. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=622.0s)]
*  I think that's a really good thing. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=623.0s)]
*  I think that's a really good thing. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoE1uTRwzQ&t=624.0s)]
