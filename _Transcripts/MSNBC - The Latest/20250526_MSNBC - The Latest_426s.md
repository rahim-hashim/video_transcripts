# ‘Profoundly dangerous’: Fmr. CIA official reacts to NSC mass layoffs
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A)
*  Now to a big shakeup at the White House. Officials announcing the firing of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=0.0s)]
*  potentially more than 100 members of the National Security Council, the latest [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=4.12s)]
*  shoot a drop since the ouster of former Trump National Security Advisor Mike [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=8.76s)]
*  Waltz. Joining me now our friend Ned Price, former deputy ambassador to the UN. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=12.18s)]
*  He also served as spokesperson for the State Department and that also worked at [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=17.52s)]
*  the CIA. Ned, welcome. So what are you hearing about this shakeup and how many [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=21.2s)]
*  people are being dismissed? And what do you think of the real world implications [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=26.319999999999997s)]
*  for national security because of it? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=30.2s)]
*  Alex, these are all good questions. And the fact that we don't have precise [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  answers to these very questions is itself a cause for concern. In terms of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  what we know, it sounds like about 100 career professionals have been sent [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  back as a Friday afternoon to their home agencies. That's the big headline. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=45.84s)]
*  That's the what. But in some ways it is the how and the why that are even more [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=50.0s)]
*  concerning as we learn more about this development. In terms of the how, look, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=56.0s)]
*  the Trump White House is not the first White House to want to or to purport to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=61.0s)]
*  want to create an NSC that is nimbler and leaner and in some ways more [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=65.36s)]
*  effective. I spent three years in the National Security Council staff under [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=70.88s)]
*  President Obama. That was a goal of ours as well. But there's a smart way to do [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=74.0s)]
*  this and there's a dangerous way to do it. And the dangerous way to do it is to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=78.6s)]
*  in one fell swoop, send everyone home at 4.30 p.m. on a Friday before a three day [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=82.76s)]
*  weekend. We would always joke that long weekends were a recipe for national [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=89.16s)]
*  security crises and they are really tempting something very unfortunate, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=93.28s)]
*  something even profoundly dangerous by dismissing everyone in one fell swoop [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=98.56s)]
*  and just saying goodbye on a Friday afternoon. But the other important [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=102.52s)]
*  question here is the why. Look, as I said before, I worked for a National [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=106.56s)]
*  Security Council that wanted to be nimbler and more effective. My concern [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=110.12s)]
*  here is that they're not doing this for efficiency. They are doing this to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=113.6s)]
*  really stamp out any ideological dissent to prevent this very body from [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=117.0s)]
*  generating ideas that may not be seen as something President Trump would want [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  to seek in his own policy choices. That's really the goal of the National [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=128.52s)]
*  Security Council staff in some ways. It's why the current iteration of the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=132.32s)]
*  National Security Council has been around since the Bay of Pigs, really, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=135.88s)]
*  because President Kennedy realized that he was not well served by his advisors [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=139.12s)]
*  engaging in what's known as group think he wanted a body to challenge him to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  bring in the interagency to present options and ultimately to tee up [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=148.0s)]
*  decisions. What President Trump is doing with this is profoundly dangerous. And [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=152.24s)]
*  I do fear, as you said, that will feel the consequences for a long time to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=156.0s)]
*  come. So bottom line, it is perceived as a political and you worry that this may [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=159.72000000000003s)]
*  be a political move. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=164.0s)]
*  Absolutely. This is again not about coordination. This doesn't seem to be [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=166.72s)]
*  about efficiency. This is about ensuring ideological purity and ideological [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=170.88s)]
*  purity is really the last thing that you want in the National Security Council [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  staff, the very body that's supposed to present options to be creative to give [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  the president input for decisions if they are just teeing up exactly what he [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=183.56s)]
*  is ordering without engendering some of these new ideas and options. That's [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=191.32s)]
*  dangerous. Ultimately. Yeah, let's turn the U. S. Iran nuclear talks. They [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=195.64s)]
*  wrapped up after a fifth round of negotiations in Rome. So the Wall Street [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=200.2s)]
*  Journal reports now that they may be working on the framework of a deal, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  leaving important details to be negotiated later. NBC News is not [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=207.44s)]
*  independently confirmed this reporting. But if this is the case, what questions [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  does it raise for you? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=215.0s)]
*  Well, it's actually these two stories are very much related. The turmoil at [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  the National Security Council and what's going on with Iran. And I say that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  because the Trump administration has approached these negotiations since the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=224.44s)]
*  earliest days of this administration in a very haphazard way. This [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  administration has been all over the map in terms of what the United States [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=231.32s)]
*  seeks out of these discussions. Iran has been very clear about what it wants. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=234.48s)]
*  But if you listen to the various principles over the course the past three [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=239.72s)]
*  months, at one point we were willing to countenance enrichment on Iranian soil. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=243.16s)]
*  At one point we were focused on a model by which Iran would have to import [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=247.8s)]
*  uranium that had been enriched elsewhere. And now it seems that they're at least [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=251.84s)]
*  purporting that the United States government won't tolerate any level of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  enrichment on Iranian territory. And I say these two stories are related because [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=259.36s)]
*  the National Security Council is there to adjudicate decisions just like this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=263.52000000000004s)]
*  The Iranian question is one that involves politics. It's one that involves [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=267.76s)]
*  geopolitics, intelligence, defense, energy and very technical questions. And [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  so you need all this expertise to determine at the outset what it is that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=276.0s)]
*  we're after. And the fact that we've had these several different answers from our [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  own government over the course of the past few months really says to me that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  they don't know what they want. They don't have a process to determine that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=287.72s)]
*  And ultimately, when we're not clear on our own goals, I think we run the risk of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=291.92s)]
*  allowing the other side to outpace us. But again, if they are successful in this [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  effort, I think we have to remind ourselves that they might be able to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=301.92s)]
*  approximate what the United States had until 2018. And that is to say a [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=305.2s)]
*  verifiable permanent basis to ensure Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=309.16s)]
*  We had it until 2018 because President Trump abandoned it in 2018. So they're [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=313.48s)]
*  really trying to recreate the status quo ante. I hope they're successful [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=318.04s)]
*  because the Iranian nuclear challenge is a big one for the United States. But [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=322.12s)]
*  very little of what we've seen so far gives me that optimism. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=325.36s)]
*  It's interesting because the Washington Post has a new report. It's from inside [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  Tehran for the first time in 10 years. You have NBC News chief foreign [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  correspondent Richard Engel. He's been reporting from inside Iran in recent [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  weeks. What do you think the significant is of Iran inviting foreign [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=338.88s)]
*  journalists? Are you reading something into that? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=342.44s)]
*  Well, look, clearly Iran is signaling in ways both overt and subtle to the Trump [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=345.76s)]
*  administration that they want to do business. Even the foreign minister [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=350.8s)]
*  pendant, not that in the Washington Post, I believe that touted billions, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=354.88s)]
*  if not larger sums of investment opportunities for the United States if [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=358.44s)]
*  Iran were to be open for business. In other words, if all the sanctions were [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=363.08s)]
*  dropped. So yes, Tehran is very clearly broadcasting that they want to arrive at [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=366.44s)]
*  a deal. Whether we can arrive at a deal that meets all of our goals, including [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=372.67999999999995s)]
*  goals that we very much need a verifiable and permanent basis on which [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=377.64s)]
*  to ensure that Iran never again never develops a nuclear weapon. That's a very [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=381.64s)]
*  open question. Yes, of course, there will be investment opportunities if the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=386.67999999999995s)]
*  sanctions are dropped. But whether this team can be successful and what their [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=390.2s)]
*  stated goal is to prevent Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon again, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=394.44s)]
*  I hope they're successful. I think there are many reasons to believe they're [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=398.52s)]
*  gonna have great difficulty just watching the turmoil within the White [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=401.32s)]
*  House itself. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zKuWGKr0A&t=405.6s)]
