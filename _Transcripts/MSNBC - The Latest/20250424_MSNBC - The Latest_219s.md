# Pope Francis had 'unique ability to talk to people's hearts': Father Timothy Kesicki
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY)
*  Our next guest had the honor of meeting, being with the Pope four different times. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Father Timothy Kasecki, former president of the Jesuit Conference of Canada and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  the United States. Father, thank you so much for being with us. Just, how do you see this fervor, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=10.0s)]
*  thousands and thousands of people just waiting for the opportunity to say their goodbyes to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=19.76s)]
*  Pope Francis, waiting even overnight to do so? How do you define and describe this? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=25.52s)]
*  I think Pope Francis had a unique ability to talk to people's hearts. No one ever felt that he was [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=35.28s)]
*  talking down to them. Even if he was taking a very sensitive or a difficult topic, he always looked [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  into your eyes and almost spoke to your soul. And I think the throngs of people you see coming in, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=47.44s)]
*  what he called the Jubilee Year of Hope, are coming in part because they loved him and in part [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=53.12s)]
*  because they find hope in the legacy of his life. That was certainly the experience I had whenever [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  I was with him. And what were the most significant moments or experiences that you had with him? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=66.16s)]
*  Well, he had a great sense of humor. I can remember meeting him in St. Peter's Square. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=75.84s)]
*  It was during one of his audiences and I told him I was a Jesuit and he responded to me in Italian, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=81.92s)]
*  e la tua colpa, which translates, well, that's your fault. And he does a picture of me just laughing [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=88.08s)]
*  because he could catch you off guard. I have another powerful memory. The first time I met him, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=95.12s)]
*  my father was having a surgery because he had cancer. And I'll never forget the Pope just [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=100.88s)]
*  grabbing me close to him and saying, what's his name? I will pray for him. So he had this [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=106.88s)]
*  incredible pastoral heart, but he wasn't afraid to challenge us and that we should never take for [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=113.52s)]
*  granted our vocation, especially as Jesuits. And the fact that Francis was the first Jesuit [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=119.36s)]
*  Pope, what's the significance of that? Well, so yeah, no one ever anticipated this. St. Ignatius [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits, actually discouraged Jesuits from saying yes to becoming [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=134.08s)]
*  bishops in part because he wanted us to serve the church in another way. So he was the first in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=139.76s)]
*  almost 500 years and the church really hadn't elected a Pope from a religious order since the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=145.28s)]
*  1830s. But I would say as a Jesuit Pope, people saw that there were some differences. I mean, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=151.36s)]
*  he was still a Cardinal Archbishop. He was still a priest, but you know, his bringing in a small [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=158.08s)]
*  consult of people would be very characteristically Jesuit. His picking up the phone and talking to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=163.6s)]
*  individuals, he didn't really go through, you know, his curial staff. He would actually just pick up [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=171.28s)]
*  the phone and call anyone around the world. The most humorous was he called to cancel his newspaper [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=177.68s)]
*  the day after he was elected Pope. I think he even used the line, in case you didn't see it in the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  news, I won't be moving back to Buenos Aires. So I think that very personal touch helped define [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=187.52s)]
*  him as a Pope. Father Giustice, thank you so much for being with us. Very much appreciated. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=193.68s)]
*  you [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ocVQ85gwY&t=217.44s)]
