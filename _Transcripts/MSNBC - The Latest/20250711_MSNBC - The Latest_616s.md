# Where is FEMA? Texas flood response potentially delayed due to Noem policy
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao)
*  AMBASSIES, PRISCILLA THOMPSON IS ON THE SCENE FOR US IN CURVILLE, TEXAS. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=0.0s)]
*  ALSO WITH US, ROYTER'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT JEFF MASON AND FORMER SENIOR FEMA OFFICIAL [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=4.16s)]
*  IN THE ABOMB ADMINISTRATION LARS ANDERSON. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=8.68s)]
*  WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=12.0s)]
*  PRISCILLA, WITH RECOVERY OPERATIONS ONGOING NOW AHEAD OF THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT, WHERE [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=13.0s)]
*  DO THINGS STAND AND WHAT WILL WE SEE FROM THE PRESIDENT? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=17.16s)]
*  Yeah, Alex, still more than 160 people in this county alone still missing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=20.96s)]
*  And so the focus today remains on that search effort. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=28.32s)]
*  At daybreak today, we saw a task force going out in boats, beginning that effort again [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=31.7s)]
*  today. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=37.4s)]
*  And that is undoubtedly something that the president will likely see and hear about a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=38.4s)]
*  lot today as he arrives around midday. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  He's expected to meet with first responders and officials, so he will get a briefing on [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=45.24s)]
*  those efforts. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  And then he will likely also hear of some of those heroic stories of first responders [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  who one week ago today were out as these floods were rushing in, trying to save as [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=55.3s)]
*  many people as they could. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=60.459999999999994s)]
*  And he's also expected to meet with the families of these victims, families who have lost loved [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=62.379999999999995s)]
*  ones, families who are still waiting for word of loved ones. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=68.34s)]
*  And of course, all of this comes as this effort does appear to be becoming less of a rescue [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=71.22s)]
*  effort and much more of a recovery effort with the urgency growing with each passing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=76.86s)]
*  hour just for any sort of closure for so many of these families who are still missing [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=81.42s)]
*  loved ones at this point. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=85.54s)]
*  So thank you for that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=88.58s)]
*  Let's move to you now, Jeff. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=89.74000000000001s)]
*  We have Trump's visits to disaster areas. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=90.94s)]
*  I mean, look, they are often shaped by the political makeup of that area. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=93.34s)]
*  You'll recall before visiting wildfire ravaged Los Angeles earlier this year, he heaped blame [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=96.86s)]
*  on California's leaders and he threatened to withhold federal aid. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=102.7s)]
*  It is a stark contrast to this rhetoric about the Texas flood. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=106.42s)]
*  This is Texas. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=110.42s)]
*  So what are you watching for when he visits? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=112.10000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right to highlight that, Alex. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=114.38s)]
*  Look, it is a it is a typical job for any president of the United States to go and visit [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=117.66s)]
*  disaster areas after big storms and other natural disasters. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=122.26s)]
*  President Trump is no different in that he is doing that and doing it today with First [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=126.1s)]
*  Lady Melania Trump. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=130.16s)]
*  What is different is exactly what you just said. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=131.3s)]
*  The there's politics involved in every bit of presidential travel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=134.3s)]
*  President Trump highlights and elevates that by directing criticism at democratic states [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=138.62s)]
*  like California when he went there ahead of his visit or during the visit. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=145.18s)]
*  And that is not what he's doing when he's going to Texas. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=149.56s)]
*  Texas, of course, is a red state. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=151.54s)]
*  The area where the storm happened was especially supportive of President Trump in the 2024 [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=153.9s)]
*  election. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  So I think you'll see and hear nothing but praise. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=160.54000000000002s)]
*  I think you also will not hear him responding in a way that shows any sort of second guess [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  about the federal response. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=168.58s)]
*  The other piece, though, that I'm looking for, Alex, to your question is whether or [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=170.58s)]
*  not he shows a little more of an indication of what his plans are for FEMA. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=174.46s)]
*  The president has said he wants to get rid of FEMA and do so by the end of this year, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=179.58s)]
*  but he's been hedging a little bit lately and not responding to that question when we've [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=183.9s)]
*  asked him at the White House or when he's traveling. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=189.7s)]
*  That is a pretty relevant thing right now, given the importance of FEMA in responding [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=192.1s)]
*  to this disaster and many others. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=195.38s)]
*  So I'll be watching to see if he shows any more indication of what he plans to do with [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=197.26s)]
*  that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=202.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we'll be watching that as well. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  And I ask you, Lars, a bit about that, because, yes, he wants to get rid of it or at minimum [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=204.82s)]
*  reduce the profile and the budget for FEMA. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=209.5s)]
*  Based on what you're learning about the operations in Texas, is FEMA doing anything differently [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  in this response? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=217.29999999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think FEMA is doing what it always does, is show up and try and help when they [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=219.29999999999998s)]
*  can. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=223.89999999999998s)]
*  I think what's really important and what's really interesting to note, though, is Texas [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=225.54s)]
*  is probably one of those states that is most prepared for the disasters. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  It's one of the states that's well-funded. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=231.3s)]
*  They have a good emergency manager on the ground, and yet they still need this federal [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=233.62s)]
*  response. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  They need millions, probably billions of dollars of help from the federal government. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  So if you take a state like Texas, which is ready to deal with these types of disasters, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=241.94s)]
*  and you look at smaller states that don't have the capacity, does it, really shows the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=246.78s)]
*  importance of FEMA and what FEMA does and the whole federal response. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=250.48s)]
*  Lars, here's a new Homeland Security policy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=255.04s)]
*  It requires Secretary Noem to sign off on any agency spending that exceeds $100,000. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=258.76s)]
*  And Mesa News' Kristen Welker asked the president about reports that this may have delayed the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=266.92s)]
*  federal response in Texas, and he said, quote, I don't know anything about it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=271.08s)]
*  We were right on time. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=274.82s)]
*  We were there. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=275.82s)]
*  In fact, she was the first one I saw on television. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=276.82s)]
*  Could that Noem $100,000 policy, could it slow things down during a critical response [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=279.76000000000005s)]
*  like this? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=285.12s)]
*  I do think it can. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=286.12s)]
*  You've seen reports where the search and rescue teams took longer than they normally would [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=288.72s)]
*  to get to Texas. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't know if that would have made that much of a difference in terms of finding people, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  but I think it's important to give emergency managers the ability to kind of make decisions [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  on their own or pre-deploy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  That's what, you know, after post-Katrina, those were some of the reforms that were put [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=308.12s)]
*  in place to allow emergency managers to put assets in place and really get teams off the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=311.44s)]
*  ground. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  You never want to be late in a response like this. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=319.08000000000004s)]
*  And so I think, you know, I think there'll be some lessons learned from this tragedy [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=320.64s)]
*  and hopefully they'll make some changes moving forward. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=326.2s)]
*  Well, let's talk about that, Priscilla, because we have also learned in 2024 the Kerr County [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=329.2s)]
*  officials specifically warned a flood event was likely in the next year. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=334.88s)]
*  Can you tell us more about that and whether any action was taken? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=339.84s)]
*  Yeah, Alex, and we know that they also talked about flood warning systems, but they actually [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=343.88s)]
*  decided to defer that conversation and any action on that until the plan was updated. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=351.84s)]
*  And sadly, these floodwaters rushed in before there was an opportunity to do that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  And that is despite that 2024 mitigation plan saying, quote, every jurisdiction can expect [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  to experience some type of flooding that may or may not meet the definition of a 100-year [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=369.4s)]
*  or 500-year event on a more regular basis. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=374.68s)]
*  The local planning team determined it is likely that Kerr County and the participating jurisdictions [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=378.24s)]
*  will experience a flood event in the next year. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=383.35999999999996s)]
*  And so definitely questions around this. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=387.4s)]
*  The Texas legislature is going into a special session later this month and hearings are [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=390.48s)]
*  going to be held on the entirety of the response here. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  And we know that at least one of those hearings is going to happen right here in Kerrville [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  because legislators want to hear directly from the people impacted, hear their frustrations [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=403.04s)]
*  and begin to better understand what went wrong and how they can ensure that something like [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=408.44000000000005s)]
*  this doesn't happen again. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=412.20000000000005s)]
*  Lars, what kind of prevention measures could be implemented in, say, a 12-month timeframe [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=414.44s)]
*  or less that could have really helped this situation? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=420.24s)]
*  I mean, I think when you have situations like this, warning people about the potentials [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  of the dangers is really critical. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  So that's not only the potential of these alarms that they're talking about, but really [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  a robust text message program. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=433.12s)]
*  You know, a couple days ago here in D.C., we had a major storm and I got an alert on [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=435.4s)]
*  my phone saying, you know, tornado warning. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  I think it's really important to have those types of things in place so that you get the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=442.68s)]
*  most information out to people as soon as you can. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=448.56s)]
*  Yet would that also include not extending the footprint of a camp into a floodplain, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=451.32000000000005s)]
*  as has been alleged was done with Camp Mystic? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=457.16s)]
*  You know, I don't know the details on exactly what, where Camp Mystic was located within [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=460.52000000000004s)]
*  the flood zone, but I think it's something people need to look at. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=464.8s)]
*  I read in reports that they had an emergency plan approved a couple days before this tragedy [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=467.28s)]
*  occurred. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=473.32s)]
*  They did. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=474.32s)]
*  And so, yeah, and so, you know, it makes me wonder kind of, I think people really need [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=475.32s)]
*  to take a look at where these camps are located, where these facilities are located, and really [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=479.23999999999995s)]
*  take, you know, take the flooding seriously. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=485.0s)]
*  People don't think about flooding as dangerous sometimes, but it's a huge problem. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=487.08s)]
*  They will now. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=491.88s)]
*  Yeah, they will now. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=492.88s)]
*  Jeff, I want to ask you a question, but let everyone know what we're seeing there. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=493.88s)]
*  Marine One has landed there at Joint Base Andrews, where the president will take off [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  and head down to Texas shortly. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=501.16s)]
*  He's waved off questions, Jeff, about FEMA's future, particularly while this Texas response [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=503.8s)]
*  has been playing out. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=508.48s)]
*  But then just Wednesday, Secretary Noem said this about FEMA. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=509.48s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=512.5600000000001s)]
*  It has been slow to respond at the federal level. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=513.5600000000001s)]
*  It's even been slower to get the resources to Americans in crisis. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=519.6s)]
*  And that is why this entire agency needs to be eliminated as it exists today and remade [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=523.24s)]
*  into a responsive agency. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=528.6s)]
*  And you made the point earlier that he has vowed to get rid of FEMA, but we know that [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=532.08s)]
*  he tends to change course on a dime, right? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=535.04s)]
*  Do you think today's visit could change his thinking? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=537.44s)]
*  I'm curious if you're hearing anything about that inside the White House. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=540.36s)]
*  It absolutely changes his thinking on a dime. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=543.16s)]
*  And what was instructive to me from those comments from Secretary Noem that you just [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=547.04s)]
*  is that she used the talking point of saying it needs to be eliminated, but she added in [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=551.6s)]
*  the way that it is now. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=555.96s)]
*  That leaves quite a bit of potential wiggle room for keeping FEMA, revamping FEMA, doing [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=558.08s)]
*  something to FEMA that the Trump administration can paint as having been a change or a shift [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=564.24s)]
*  or a major restructuring that doesn't entirely close it or doesn't entirely get rid of it. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=570.68s)]
*  I can't tell you whether that's what they're going to do, but I do think it's instructive [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=576.96s)]
*  that she altered her language in that way. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=580.6s)]
*  As far as Trump is concerned, the president is concerned, look, this will be his decision. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=582.6800000000001s)]
*  And he does react to human activities. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=587.28s)]
*  And I think it'll be hard not to see what he sees today and not give it some extra thought. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ77bC-c4Ao&t=591.24s)]
