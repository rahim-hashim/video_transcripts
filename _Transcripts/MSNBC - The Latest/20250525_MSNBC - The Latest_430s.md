# JD Vance knows better: Former DOJ prosecutor slams Vance’s attempt to stymie judicial review
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM)
*  President Trump's efforts to expand presidential authority to push through his extreme agenda [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=0.0s)]
*  is on a scale unlike anything the United States has ever experienced before. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=6.08s)]
*  With a neutered Republican-controlled Congress, it has been on the judicial branch to push [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  back on that agenda, and this past week alone we've seen numerous judges calling out the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=15.44s)]
*  illegality of many of Trump's actions. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  But the New York Times points out that while the courts are serving as a rare check on [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=23.44s)]
*  Trump, the judicial orders to unwind his actions can be easier said than done. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=27.88s)]
*  Case in point, on Thursday a federal judge blocked the administration from revoking Harvard [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=33.36s)]
*  University's ability to enroll foreign students, and late last night, around one in the morning, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=38.4s)]
*  Trump posted on social media a demand to know the, quote, names and countries of Harvard's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=43.92s)]
*  foreign students, which he described as being from, quote, foreign lands. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=48.44s)]
*  That is a little bit scary. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=53.8s)]
*  So joining us now we have our friend, former federal prosecutor, University of Alabama [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=55.76s)]
*  Law School professor, co-host of the Hashtag Sisters in Law podcast, and MSNBC legal analyst [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  Joyce Vance. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=67.16s)]
*  So Joyce, I don't even know where to start. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=69.0s)]
*  There's so much going on right now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=72.0s)]
*  Ultimately, is the Supreme Court just going to have to decide these cases that are how [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=74.64s)]
*  many of these big cases of executive power are they going to the nation's highest court? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=80.04s)]
*  I think that's part of the answer, Elise. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=88.04s)]
*  Ultimately, these issues will be resolved by the Supreme Court. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=90.68s)]
*  But what we're watching happening in real time is this effort by the Trump administration [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=94.72s)]
*  to shift the balance among the three branches of government that the founding fathers set [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  up in the Constitution. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump has assumed this very conservative view of a unitary executive who controls all [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=106.8s)]
*  the power of the executive branch. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=113.28s)]
*  And Trump is trying to seize, frankly, some power even beyond that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=115.72s)]
*  So ultimately, these cases, regardless of their topic, whether it's about Trump's hiring [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  power, his ability to interfere with Congress's spending power, his ability to fire people, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=124.96s)]
*  his ability to rewrite the Constitution, these all will land in the Supreme Court's lap. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=130.92s)]
*  So it's not sorts of subject matters, but a consistent theme of the effort to seize [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=136.4s)]
*  all of this power for the executive branch. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=140.8s)]
*  And you know, Joyce, it doesn't seem like even once these questions go to the Supreme [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  Court that the Trump administration or President Trump or even the vice president will accept [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=147.5s)]
*  the rulings from the Supreme Court. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=153.3s)]
*  And I say that because of something that the vice president said on Wednesday that I want [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=154.84s)]
*  you to listen to. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=159.28000000000003s)]
*  Listen, watch this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=160.28000000000003s)]
*  But I think you were seeing an effort by the courts to quite literally overturn the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=162.48s)]
*  will of the American people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=166.44s)]
*  I saw an interview with Justice Roberts, Chief Justice Roberts recently, where he said the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=168.04s)]
*  role of the court is to check the excesses of the executive. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=171.04s)]
*  I thought that was a profoundly wrong sentiment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=174.76s)]
*  That's one half of his job. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=178.34s)]
*  The other half of his job is to check the excesses of his own branch. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=180.14s)]
*  And you cannot have a country where the American people keep on electing immigration enforcement [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=185.83999999999997s)]
*  and the courts tell the American people they're not allowed to have what they voted for. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=192.4s)]
*  I mean, Joyce, he is criticizing the chief justice of the Supreme Court, who is by no [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=197.72s)]
*  means in the liberal wing of on that bench. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=204.92s)]
*  And so I just think that the vice president is profoundly wrong in his assessment of the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=210.76s)]
*  role of the Supreme Court. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=215.84s)]
*  But you are the attorney here of the two of us on the screen. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=217.44s)]
*  So what are your thoughts on what the vice president had to say? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=221.96s)]
*  So I'm not going to mince words here. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  J.D. Vance is a Yale educated lawyer. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  He understands how judicial review works. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=231.04s)]
*  And since early in the history of our country, a landmark Supreme Court case, Marbury versus [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=234.2s)]
*  Madison, just after the founding, the Supreme Court has had the power of judicial review. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=239.04s)]
*  It can review conduct by either the legislative branch or the executive branch, the president [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=245.08s)]
*  for constitutionality. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  It is not supposed to execute the will of the American people. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  And the vice president knows that it's supposed to compare actions taken by other branches [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=257.0s)]
*  of government for consistency with the Constitution. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=262.59999999999997s)]
*  And it has the ability to strike them down when they run afoul of that end of story. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=265.8s)]
*  Joyce, we've had quite a few lawyers come on the show over the last few weeks saying [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=271.08s)]
*  that at the end of the day, they do have trust that the Supreme Court will kind of, in their [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=276.12s)]
*  words, save us from some of the things, the expanding of executive power, what the president [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=281.32s)]
*  wants to do, et cetera. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=287.47999999999996s)]
*  Do you have that same hope? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  Because when I talk to Democrats in that building behind us on Capitol Hill, Democrats around [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=289.84s)]
*  the country, voters, talk to activists and advocates, they don't have that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=295.4s)]
*  So why, if you believe they you think the Supreme Court will hold as a full work, why [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=299.64s)]
*  should people feel confident that that's the case? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  So I'm trying very hard to have confidence in the Supreme Court because, frankly, they've [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=307.48s)]
*  given us some reason for concern. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=315.48s)]
*  Of course, there's Trump versus United States, the case that really threw us into this situation [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=318.0s)]
*  by giving a president virtually unlimited immunity from criminal prosecution for acts [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=323.56s)]
*  he commits while in office. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  I think that that case was a mistake. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=331.6s)]
*  We're watching it play out in real time. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  The consequences when a president is completely unbridled from accountability and responsibility [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=336.24s)]
*  are absolutely negative for the country. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  Has the court learned a lesson? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I think that that's sort of, in many ways, just a trite way of putting it because [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=347.2s)]
*  this is a court that fundamentally does believe in the unitary executive, the powerful executive. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  In a case called Loper Bright, they have done away with this notion that we have a layer [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=360.24s)]
*  of career bureaucrats, people with expertise in the executive branch, who should act based [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=365.64000000000004s)]
*  on their expertise to protect the interests of the American people. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=371.36s)]
*  So again, none of this is easy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=375.6s)]
*  Maybe it's not made for television in the sense that this is almost an entry level college [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=377.44000000000005s)]
*  class on politics. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=382.32000000000005s)]
*  Your question, will the Supreme Court hold? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=384.96000000000004s)]
*  I do believe that at the end of the day, when they face fundamental questions about this [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=387.44s)]
*  president's ability to undo government, they will hold. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=392.96s)]
*  What I'm concerned about is at the margins, some of these cases that we're seeing, where [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=397.2s)]
*  they are permitting the president to act in ways that would seem to exceed our traditional [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=402.08s)]
*  understanding of a president's power. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b32Fq6XwgWM&t=407.6s)]
