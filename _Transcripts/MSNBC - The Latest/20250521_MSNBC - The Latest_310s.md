# Medicare cuts are ‘political suicide’ for GOP and ‘campaign gold’ for Dems: Hardaway
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc)
*  All right, Congressman, look, Republicans have routinely trashed CBO scoring. We should [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=0.0s)]
*  say also routinely when the CBO has said this is going to add to the debt, it's added to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  the debt. Does it matter, though, at all? Does going another $2.3 trillion even matter [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=12.42s)]
*  anymore to people who say that they are fiscal conservatives? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=20.44s)]
*  Chris, I think something we have learned over the last few decades in American politics [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=23.48s)]
*  is that the party of fiscal responsibility is always the party out of power. So I don't [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  think that that number is going to scare Republicans from voting from this bill. The biggest obstacle [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=34.8s)]
*  Republicans have now is these hardline members who really don't care about the interests, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  about the majority makers, the centrist members that actually give either party the majority [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=45.16s)]
*  and are going to insist on very, very ambitious cuts to programs that are popular, that are [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=50.8s)]
*  important for people's health, that are creating jobs throughout the country, that are making [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=57.72s)]
*  America more energy secure. So that is the big challenge for Republicans right now. Not [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=61.68s)]
*  so much that big deficit number. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=66.48s)]
*  So Michael, let's talk about the Democrats. They're pretty fired up about this. Here's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=69.88s)]
*  a little bit of what we heard this morning from the Rules Committee about everything [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=73.2s)]
*  that they're talking about, the cuts to SNAP and Medicaid. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=77.68s)]
*  This is a backdoor attempt to force people off the benefit. So you can take that money [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=82.64s)]
*  and pay for tax cuts for billionaires. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  The purpose isn't to get people back to work. It's to kick people off of Medicaid. It's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=89.76s)]
*  to not recognize the hard work of those that already are. Because as you put it, what is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=97.04s)]
*  it, 92%? 92% of adults under 65 on Medicaid are already working. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=104.04s)]
*  Or can't work because they're caregiving, illness, they're going to school. So don't [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=112.72s)]
*  tell us about work. Because we come from families that work. We come from families that get [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=119.24s)]
*  our hands dirty. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=126.48s)]
*  But if these aid programs, Michael, are going to be cut, is there a legitimate concern that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=128.28s)]
*  that kind of message isn't going to land until we actually see the real world impact of it? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=133.72s)]
*  This is campaign gold. The idea that Republicans would mess with Medicare, which is wildly [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=138.83999999999997s)]
*  popular with seniors, is political suicide. It makes absolutely no sense. And let's not [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  forget that seniors are our largest and most engaged voting block in America. And so I [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=149.76s)]
*  don't know any politician that will privately tell you that's a good idea. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=154.55999999999997s)]
*  Alright, so Congressman, the president, behind closed doors on the Hill Tuesday, told Republicans, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=158.04s)]
*  you just heard it, not to F with Medicaid. That's according to lawmakers who were in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=164.2s)]
*  the meeting. Yet there are still, it looks like, potentially going to be huge cuts. Will [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=167.72s)]
*  voters buy that this is all because of waste, fraud and abuse when grandma gets kicked off [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=173.44s)]
*  of the program? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=178.64s)]
*  Well, Chris, it depends how steep the cuts are. Look, we know that this bill is likely [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=179.96s)]
*  to improve in this sense in the Senate. The cuts are likely to be less extreme in the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=185.76s)]
*  Senate. The president himself said yesterday that he prefers the Senate version, whatever [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=191.04s)]
*  it is that they're working on, even though that's not fully public yet. But what the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=196.08s)]
*  president wants is for these members to continue moving this process. And he doesn't want [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=200.76s)]
*  them to pursue a lot of these unpopular spending cuts. And look, there's tension in the Republican [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=207.76s)]
*  Party because we're in a situation where the president is a populist. He does not support [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=216.36s)]
*  the kinds of cuts that were associated with the Republicans in the past. But in Congress [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  there's still a lot of Republicans there who are big fans of massive cuts to government [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=226.68s)]
*  spending. So that's the tension we're seeing right now. We'll see if the president in this [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=232.4s)]
*  White House meeting can push these members to just get over these objections and move [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=236.54000000000002s)]
*  the bill. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=240.68s)]
*  It's going to be interesting to see because you must say that the president has been consistent, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=241.68s)]
*  Michael, at least in what he said. He has said that there would be no cuts. There were [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=245.52s)]
*  people who needed care would get it. Take a listen. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=251.4s)]
*  Can you guarantee that your voters, your supporters, your election, your working class voters will [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=254.4s)]
*  not lose health insurance under this bill? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=261.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh, they won't lose health insurance? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=264.24s)]
*  To your earlier point, you said, quote, oh, they won't lose health insurance. If that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=266.32s)]
*  happens, is that the sound that gets played in every ad of every Democrat in the midterms? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=271.64s)]
*  Of course it does. But also, don't believe anything Donald Trump says ever. The worst [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=275.48s)]
*  part about these Medicaid cuts that are coming is the way in which they happen, which is [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=279.96000000000004s)]
*  they're cutting payments to doctors and hospitals. So that means if grandma gets sick and has [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=284.44s)]
*  to get rushed to the hospital. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDk-5zdnulc&t=288.92s)]
