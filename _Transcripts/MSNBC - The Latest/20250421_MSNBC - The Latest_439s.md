# 'Way in over his head': Sen. Warner slams Hegseth for second Signal chat controversy
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww)
*  Joining us now is Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. He is a vice chair of the Intelligence Committee senator [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=0.0s)]
*  It's always great seeing you. I thank you for your time before senator. We get into the HECSF issue [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=4.8s)]
*  I just want your thoughts as if you would on on Pope Francis his impact and and his legacy [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=10.26s)]
*  Well, I think he made the church more inclusive [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=16.72s)]
*  I think the fact that of hope would speak to issues of social justice, you know, I'm not a Catholic myself [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=20.64s)]
*  but I thought he made [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=27.2s)]
*  Put a human face that brought a lot of young people not just across North America [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=29.96s)]
*  But across the world back into the the Catholic Church and I think he's gonna be a hard pope to replace [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=35.76s)]
*  And now getting to the other [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=42.4s)]
*  Breaking news of the day president Trump [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=45.76s)]
*  Just said he has confidence in secretary HECSF. You have opposed HECSF from day one [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  You voted against his confirmation you called on him to resign after the first signal group chat issue [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=54.04s)]
*  You're doing so again today. What do you think about these latest revelations? I [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=60.56s)]
*  think it shows a guy that's way in over his head in a job that's much too big for him and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=67.48s)]
*  You saw the little snippet where he fought or pushed back [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=74.88s)]
*  Well, he didn't deny that he put his family members on this chat [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=78.0s)]
*  The notion that this is somehow not classified information the fact that attack plans were being sent out and around [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=81.82000000000001s)]
*  Before our pilots had actually bombed the hoodies [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=90.22s)]
*  I would love to take Keith HECSF down to the Norfolk Naval Station [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=93.78s)]
*  Which is the home port of the aircraft carrier Truman from which these strikes were launched and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=98.26s)]
*  Explained to the family and friends that focused on the Truman how this kind of information getting out [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=104.66s)]
*  wouldn't have put their loved ones in harm's way because he couldn't and I think it is amazing that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=109.9s)]
*  He's not been held accountable. I think it's remarkable as well as you see a number of his senior officials quit and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=117.3s)]
*  This is a an example again of chaos on steroids that are coming out of the DOD [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=124.53999999999999s)]
*  And I just wonder Jose when are my Republican [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=130.14s)]
*  Senator friends who say they're for national security gonna say this is too much [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=135.06s)]
*  This is just a bridge too far and join me and others and say this guy needs to be replaced [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=140.1s)]
*  And so senator I'm just wondering because this is this would be the second time of confirmation [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=146.26s)]
*  that the Secretary of Defense has utilized this signal app for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=152.34s)]
*  communications that included [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=158.22s)]
*  sensitive information to say the least [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=159.98s)]
*  What like for example do you all in the Senate in the Intelligence Committee utilize [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=162.85999999999999s)]
*  signal the signal app to communicate any kind of information and what [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=169.78s)]
*  It's it's just it's it's such a basic question [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=175.94s)]
*  Well signal I use signal matter of fact signal is safer than [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=180.42s)]
*  traditional [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=186.85999999999999s)]
*  Cellphone communications particularly since we know China through the salt typhoon hack has hacked into our systems [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=188.14s)]
*  but using signal, you know to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=194.42s)]
*  decide where I'm gonna go have dinner with a friend is very different than putting on signal classified information and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=198.14s)]
*  Anyone who denies that attack plans before an attack takes place or during an attack [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=206.9s)]
*  Taking place putting out on a non secure [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=214.54s)]
*  Channel and signal is not secure. It's better than normal, but it's not fully secure [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=218.14s)]
*  Saying that's not classified either shows a remarkable ignorance or they're just flat-out lying [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  Because anyone at the DOD or in the intelligence community if they had done this behavior, they would be fired without question [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=228.82s)]
*  Senator how secure or insecure is [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=238.54s)]
*  signal [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=243.54s)]
*  We do know that the our adversaries the Chinese and the Russians of the world have tried to penetrate signal the thing that we also [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  Don't have an answer from yet because if they have been able to penetrate you can sometimes drop in malware [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=254.18s)]
*  Without actually having control of the phone [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=260.26s)]
*  We don't even have an answer from the first group of folks that included the vice president and the National Security advisors and others [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=262.58s)]
*  Did anybody even screen their phones for malware now? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=269.98s)]
*  We've got Hegseth and his family members and a host of others is anybody going back and checking these devices [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=273.5s)]
*  this is basic cyber and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=279.9s)]
*  Intel 101 and I have zero confidence [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=282.78s)]
*  that any steps have been taken on remediation and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=286.82s)]
*  You know, we've got to have I've got all the Democrats on Senate Intel. We have written repeatedly on this got no response [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=290.26s)]
*  You know, when are Republicans gonna find the courage to actually speak up for our national security or are they going to allow this? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=299.38s)]
*  Constant drift at DOD which again undermines morale [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=306.46000000000004s)]
*  When you see the top getting off with behavior that nobody else would get off with [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=311.02000000000004s)]
*  Get away with and then you've seen these more serious folks get fired recently at DOD [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=315.3s)]
*  I think this is undermining the the confidence that are men and women who protect our country [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  Having this senior leadership and it's time for this guy to go [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=326.7s)]
*  And Senator meanwhile, we're following breaking news about Homeland Security Secretary [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=330.86s)]
*  Kristi Gnomes bag stolen from a DC restaurant reportedly containing [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=334.42s)]
*  Well tons of cash her ID including passport and DHS access badge. Just wondering [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=338.86s)]
*  Doesn't don't officials have [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=346.62s)]
*  Secret service protection. I mean, what what do you think when you hear this? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=349.46s)]
*  Well, again, I don't know the particulars [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=354.53999999999996s)]
*  on this incident, but if you're a cabinet member you have security and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=357.7s)]
*  You know, I can tell you when I was governor I had security if I'd left something behind my guys would make sure it got [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=364.65999999999997s)]
*  Corrected but it just in my mind this reflects a pattern of sloppiness of carelessness of not treating [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=369.9s)]
*  You know the information and materials that you receive [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=377.58s)]
*  From any of these roles in the government positions in an appropriate manner and I think it permeates the whole [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=381.82s)]
*  Senior level of this administration where they think they're above the law [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=389.90000000000003s)]
*  They're above any of the normal rules that are made for everyone else and this will come back and bite us [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=393.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean and you know if it was just you know a [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=401.38s)]
*  run of the mill [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=405.54s)]
*  Purse snatching in a restaurant somewhere [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=408.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean how could something like this happen to whatever else it could have been senator [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=410.5s)]
*  It's always a pleasure to see you. I thank you very much for your time [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=416.14000000000004s)]
*  You [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmvlZFRtww&t=437.54s)]
