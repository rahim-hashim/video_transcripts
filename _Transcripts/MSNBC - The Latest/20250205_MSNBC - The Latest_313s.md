# ‘You don’t have leadership in Washington’: Widespread reaction after Trump floats taking over Gaza
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998)
*  Aaron, what is your reaction to this? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=0.0s)]
*  But I don't know, do we call it a proposal? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=2.64s)]
*  Do we call it a plan? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=4.64s)]
*  Do we call it an idea? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=5.8s)]
*  What's your reaction to it? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=7.4s)]
*  My head was exploding when I listened [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=10.92s)]
*  to the press conference. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=12.98s)]
*  27 years of working for Republicans and Democrats [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=14.42s)]
*  from the Carter administration to Bush 43. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=17.02s)]
*  No administration that I worked for ever [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=19.62s)]
*  conceived of an idea which was more detached [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=24.92s)]
*  from reality and more dangerous. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=28.7s)]
*  Perhaps with the exception, and that there was context here [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=32.0s)]
*  with respect to 9-11 for our invasion [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=35.9s)]
*  of Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=38.64s)]
*  And it just strikes me how much of an outlier [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=40.5s)]
*  the president actually is. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=46.34s)]
*  You have a situation where the US has now tethered itself [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=48.14s)]
*  to an approach which at best is, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=50.92s)]
*  will be interpreted as forced transfer. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=53.86s)]
*  Number one, he's undermined traditional US allies, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=56.7s)]
*  Egypt and Israel, who doesn't look at this as a, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=60.18s)]
*  they don't look at it as a real estate deal. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=62.42s)]
*  It's an existential threat for them [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=64.44s)]
*  to absorb large numbers of Palestinians. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=66.12s)]
*  He's validated the fantasies and the narrative [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=68.68s)]
*  of the Israeli right. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=71.72s)]
*  And he sent an unmistakable signal [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=73.92s)]
*  to Putin and to Xi, that if in fact you want territory, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=77.1s)]
*  you simply aspire to it and you state your capacity [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=81.66s)]
*  completely untethered from anything, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=86.7s)]
*  international law, logic, rationality, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  to basically assert your control over it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  And it was all done standing next [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  to an Israeli prime minister who looked like a cat [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=98.04s)]
*  that had just swallowed a canary. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=101.18s)]
*  The real takeaway, final point, Jose, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=103.18s)]
*  the real takeaway here is not the unserious proposal [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=105.66000000000001s)]
*  by an unserious president over Gaza. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  The real takeaway to me is the fact [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=112.06s)]
*  that this press conference was a no daylight [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  between Israel and the US press conference. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=116.77999999999999s)]
*  He's equipped the prime minister with talking points [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=120.58s)]
*  that will help him keep his government together. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  And it just seems to me what's at stake here is real. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=127.16s)]
*  That is to say the implementation of the first [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=131.01999999999998s)]
*  and second phase of the Gaza agreement. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=133.56s)]
*  He more or less stepped away from that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  Those are the thoughts. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, Aaron, just thinking about your vast experience [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=140.14s)]
*  on issues and you know, I mean, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  I think it's important to just underline [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=144.76s)]
*  just how much experience you have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=147.76s)]
*  and how many different negotiations [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=149.86s)]
*  you have been a part of. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=152.54s)]
*  And I'm just wondering when all of those negotiations [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=153.7s)]
*  for the vast majority of them ended up with no progress [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=159.68s)]
*  for the Palestinian people. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=165.78s)]
*  And you know, Camp David and the Abraham Accords, yes. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=168.02s)]
*  But Aaron, where does negotiating the same terms [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=171.84s)]
*  and under the same language become [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=178.14s)]
*  just an echo repeating itself? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=181.18s)]
*  And where do you draw the line, Aaron, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=184.12s)]
*  on stating things that are completely maybe impossible, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=186.72s)]
*  but that as a negotiating tactic could at least elicit [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=192.45999999999998s)]
*  a different conversation? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=197.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I stand alone in terms of the number [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=200.36s)]
*  of failed negotiations I participated in. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=204.3s)]
*  But this is not that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=207.56s)]
*  This is something that goes beyond [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=208.72000000000003s)]
*  even failed American peacemaking efforts. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=210.68s)]
*  This is an effort to shackle the Arab states [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=212.96s)]
*  with the absorption of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=216.26000000000002s)]
*  who have already been traumatized [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=219.86s)]
*  and are gonna become refugees again [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=222.02s)]
*  should this plan be implemented. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=224.10000000000002s)]
*  And it's so detached from reality [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=226.0s)]
*  that I think it has zero chance of being implemented. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=228.12s)]
*  But what is missing here, Jose, is leadership. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=231.4s)]
*  And if you want a resolution [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  if you want a conflict ending solution, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=240.36s)]
*  if you want to best all previous efforts [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=244.12s)]
*  by Republicans and Democrats, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=246.34s)]
*  then what you need are Israeli and Palestinian leaders [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=247.62s)]
*  who are masters of their political houses, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=250.8s)]
*  not prisoners of their ideologies, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=252.84s)]
*  leaders who are prepared to recognize [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=255.0s)]
*  that negotiation is not based on an asymmetry of power, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=256.62s)]
*  but on a balance of interests. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=259.98s)]
*  And together with those Israeli-Palestinian leaders, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=262.06s)]
*  you need an American president who's got will and skill [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=264.82s)]
*  and a reasonable interpretation of what is required [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=269.18s)]
*  to solve, or at least to begin to address [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=274.78000000000003s)]
*  what I call the problem of the much too promised land. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=278.38s)]
*  That's missing. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=282.16s)]
*  You don't have leadership in Israel. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=283.66s)]
*  You don't have leadership in Palestine. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=285.2s)]
*  And you certainly, based on what I saw last night, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=287.4s)]
*  you don't have leadership in Washington. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=291.24s)]
