# 'Pope of surprises': Pope Francis' lasting impact on the Catholic Church
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY)
*  Joining me now is Kim Daniels, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=0.0s)]
*  Director for the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=2.06s)]
*  and Public Life at Georgetown. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=4.74s)]
*  Good to see you, Kim. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=6.46s)]
*  I think it's important to point out that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=7.78s)]
*  Pope Francis was not on most of the major lists [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=10.18s)]
*  heading into the 2013 Conclave. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=13.06s)]
*  He was considered too old, that his time had passed. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=15.26s)]
*  It's kind of a testament to the idea that the next pontiff [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=19.1s)]
*  could be an awful lot of people. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=21.84s)]
*  Just how open is the upcoming Conclave, do you think? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=24.26s)]
*  Well, I think, looking back, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=28.18s)]
*  today is such a sad day for so many Catholics. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=29.88s)]
*  And also, it's one of hope as we look forward [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=32.2s)]
*  to the spiritual renewal, structural reform [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=34.72s)]
*  that Pope Francis has started, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=37.04s)]
*  and that will continue into the future. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  But I look back, I was there in St. Peter's Square in 2013 [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=40.68s)]
*  when Pope Francis was elected, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=44.28s)]
*  and I remember that feeling of not really knowing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=46.08s)]
*  what was going to happen, and it truly was. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  He was unknown in the sense that nobody really expected him. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=51.3s)]
*  I think that at this time as well, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=54.72s)]
*  we don't know who will come out on that balcony [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=56.38s)]
*  after the white smoke goes up. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=58.86s)]
*  And we're here praying as Catholics, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=61.14s)]
*  knowing, confident in the Holy Spirit, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=63.18s)]
*  that the church is going to move forward. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  And again, it's a prayerful and sorrowful day, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=66.08s)]
*  but one that we look forward in hope. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=68.98s)]
*  Under Pope Francis, the College of Cardinals [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=71.18s)]
*  has become more diverse, right? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  He appointed them geographically and racially diverse. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=74.78s)]
*  Places like Tonga, second and third tier cities in Nigeria, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=80.22s)]
*  Argentina, his picks now make up two thirds [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=84.82s)]
*  of the electors responsible for selecting his successor. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=88.22s)]
*  So what impact will that likely have? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=92.34s)]
*  You know, it's fascinating. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=95.58s)]
*  The Catholic Church is the most multicultural, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  multilingual institution in the world. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=98.94s)]
*  There are 1.4 billion Catholics around the world, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=102.3s)]
*  and only 6% of them are here in the United States. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  So one of the great visions of Pope Francis [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=107.5s)]
*  is to remind us all that we are a global church, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=110.34s)]
*  that the focus, he would say the most important places [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=112.92s)]
*  are the places that we usually see as on the peripheries. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  And that's where he took his travels, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=118.92s)]
*  and that's where he focused the people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=120.76s)]
*  that he appointed to be Cardinal, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=123.76s)]
*  the people he appointed to elect the next Pope, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  and to help him in his leadership. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=127.72s)]
*  So it really is open in the sense [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=129.56s)]
*  that there will be a lot of people coming [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=131.32s)]
*  from around the world, a lot of Cardinals coming [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=132.96s)]
*  to participate in this conclave. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=135.08s)]
*  And at the same time, I wanna say that the other thing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  that Pope Francis did was this synod, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=139.6s)]
*  this global listening process that he's had [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  over the past three years to see how the church [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  can go forward and to, again, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=146.86s)]
*  rooted in tradition but looking forward. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=149.26000000000002s)]
*  And I think there were a lot of Cardinals [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=150.94s)]
*  who participated in that, who got to know each other [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=152.46s)]
*  a little bit through that process. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=154.82s)]
*  NBC News has a short list of some of the possible contenders. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=157.18s)]
*  Others have their own lists. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=160.5s)]
*  But does some of the names that are out there now [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=162.68s)]
*  tell us anything about where the college is leaning toward, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=165.06s)]
*  a more progressive, more Francis-like church, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  or more conservative, more Benedict-like faction [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=170.66s)]
*  of the church? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=174.32s)]
*  You know, I think it's less about those kinds [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=176.16s)]
*  of categories, which don't really apply [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  when you talk about the Catholic church. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=180.04s)]
*  It's not really that kind of political differentiation, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  but more about the path of renewal and reform [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=184.48s)]
*  that Pope Francis has set the church on. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=186.92s)]
*  So I think that if I had to say something [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  about who the Cardinal electors might be looking for, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=192.2s)]
*  it would be somebody who could continue that idea [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=195.5s)]
*  of structural reform in the church [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=198.34s)]
*  and spiritual renewal as well. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=199.94s)]
*  And we know that Pope Francis was the Pope of surprises [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=201.73999999999998s)]
*  in many ways. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  We know that the Holy Spirit is often very surprising. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  We're confident that the church will be going forward [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=208.34s)]
*  in this vision of hope and of joy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=210.64s)]
*  And at the same time, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=212.66s)]
*  we don't know where it will go right now. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=214.1s)]
*  So because so many of these Cardinals are relatively new, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=216.29999999999998s)]
*  so many of them, this will be their first conclave. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=218.98s)]
*  And they may not, especially ones who come [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  from far-flung nations, may not have any kind [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=224.14s)]
*  of long-standing relationships with many [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=227.44s)]
*  of the other members of the College of Cardinals [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  who are more experienced, who have been around [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  for previous conclaves. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=235.32s)]
*  How does that inform what happens? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  And what's it like behind the scenes [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  when people start arriving? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=241.44s)]
*  Now, one of the things about being in Rome [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  and being at the Vatican is that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=245.82s)]
*  it's such a relational place, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=247.16s)]
*  People get to know each other over coffee, over meals. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=249.11999999999998s)]
*  That will be the same with the Cardinal electors [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=252.72s)]
*  who are coming to Rome. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=255.2s)]
*  There are also these general congregations, right? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=256.53999999999996s)]
*  These gatherings, where they were gathered together [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=258.58s)]
*  and speak their mind about what they believe [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=260.68s)]
*  the Holy Spirit is looking for in the next pope [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=263.29999999999995s)]
*  and in the vision of the church going forward from here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=266.29999999999995s)]
*  And so those conversations will happen [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=268.58s)]
*  formally and informally, but I do wanna emphasize that, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  again, people have gotten to know each other a little bit [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  through this synod process, some through social media [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=277.5s)]
*  and other ways in which we can engage more fully these days. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=280.7s)]
*  But it will be a time of meeting in person [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=284.44s)]
*  and prayerfully reflecting on who should be our next pope. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  Kim Daniels, it's so good to have you on the program. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=290.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw-GyqmKEhY&t=292.72s)]
