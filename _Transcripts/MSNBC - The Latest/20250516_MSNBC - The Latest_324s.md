*  I know it's a busy time [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  So do appreciate your time with us and you heard the governor there the door is open [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  Has there been any communication around the contract negotiations today? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=90.64s)]
*  We just received some some communication to try to schedule a meeting for 1 p.m. On Sunday [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=95.68s)]
*  We've made it clear that yesterday [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=101.44s)]
*  We were available until the strike deadline at 1201 a.m [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  New Jersey transit chose to be in negotiations at 950 [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=108.56s)]
*  And we were fully prepared to keep going until 1201 a.m to try to get this resolved [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=113.36s)]
*  All right, so plans for potentially a monday meeting. What would you expect to come from that? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Do you think that what you have managed to create today the disruption across the state of new jersey? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=123.84s)]
*  Given a sunday meeting before the monday commute and people trying to get back to work [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=131.11999999999998s)]
*  Do you hold out hope that there will be something there that you might be able to sink your teeth into and say we can work [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=136.16s)]
*  with this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=140.72s)]
*  Yeah, well so and and I would rephrase that I don't think we created the situation. I think new jersey transit created the situation by forcing us out [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=142.16s)]
*  When they got up at 950, they knew that the strike deadline was at 1201 a.m [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=150.48s)]
*  And they knew that our members had a year prior had voted in 100 percent [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  First to first strike and so they knew they knew what the outcome was going to was going to be when they got up and left [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=160.88s)]
*  The negotiations yesterday. Okay [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  We are hopeful that we will get to a deal [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=171.28s)]
*  And mark by the way, I didn't mean to imply [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=173.92s)]
*  That this was on you guys. I'm just sorry if that was the interpretation [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=176.48s)]
*  But let me ask you about what the governor said, which is this i'll have you listen to it about the more than 400 engineers [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=180.16s)]
*  Who have walked off the job here it is [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=185.76s)]
*  It is frankly a mess of their own making [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=187.92s)]
*  And it is a slap in the face of every commuter and worker who relies on nj transit [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=191.28s)]
*  Happy to have you respond to that. What is your reaction? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=196.88s)]
*  Yeah, so this this was created by new jersey's transits failure to to negotiate with us in good faith over the last five years [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=200.16s)]
*  This just didn't happen [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=207.6s)]
*  This just didn't happen yesterday [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=209.6s)]
*  And so we've been trying we've been seeking agreement with new jersey transit for almost six years [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=211.6s)]
*  For almost six years our locomotive engineers have not received a pay increase for six years during covet [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=215.92s)]
*  During the highest inflationary period in my lifetime [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=222.64s)]
*  And and they still have not had a pay raise today [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=226.0s)]
*  And so we would say that new jersey transit created this new jersey transit will say that it's fiscally irresponsible for them to give us the pay raises [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=228.56s)]
*  However, they had the money to spend 500 million dollars on a new office building [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  They spent 53 million dollars to furnish that office building and they continued to spend 40 000 a month on parking for their employees all of which [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=240.96s)]
*  Could have went to the locomotive engineers [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=249.84s)]
*  Um the last new jersey strike, uh mark the transit strike it lasted over a month on 1983 [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=252.72s)]
*  What are the chances commuters should prep for that? Is that by any chance a likely timeline? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=260.4s)]
*  Well, I will say this we're we're a bottom-up organization not top down [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=266.64s)]
*  And so our members have give us direction [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=270.8s)]
*  Uh when when they took the strike, uh, when we took the strike ballot a year ago [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=273.12s)]
*  We had 100 of our our locomotive engineers that voted to strike if necessary [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=277.68s)]
*  They're committed. They're they're united [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=282.24s)]
*  Uh to get it to get a fair agreement and I think unless new jersey transit comes to the table [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  With a fair offer that's acceptable to our members. Uh, we're going to stay. Uh, we're going to stay [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=290.16s)]
*  In a strike situation [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=296.0s)]
*  Okay, mark wallace, I thank you again on a very busy time for you for joining us and letting our viewers know what's going on [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=297.84s)]
*  Thank you [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eNvL72q3hE&t=303.76s)]
