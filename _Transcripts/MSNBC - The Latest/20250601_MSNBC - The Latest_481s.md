# BREAKING: Multiple injured in downtown Boulder, Colorado attack
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc)
*  Pearl Street here in Boulder. The initial callers indicated that there was a man with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=0.0s)]
*  a weapon and that people were being set on fire. The initial response by our officers [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=8.5s)]
*  we were on scene very quickly. When we arrived we encountered multiple victims that were [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=14.5s)]
*  injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries. While our officers and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=21.22s)]
*  paramedics and fire department personnel got those victims quickly to the hospital, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=28.62s)]
*  our officers were pointed out, a suspect was pointed out to our officers on the scene. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=34.14s)]
*  Our officers immediately encountered that suspect who was taken into custody without [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=39.54s)]
*  incident. That suspect who I'm not able to ID at this time was taken to the hospital [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=44.1s)]
*  with some minor injuries as well and there's a lot more we're investigating right now before [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=49.58s)]
*  release information on that person. The scene itself is contained but we have a large area [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=55.099999999999994s)]
*  here in downtown Boulder closed off right now. Businesses have been closed and we have [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=61.419999999999995s)]
*  asked people to avoid the area. This area is not safe yet. We're dealing with a vehicle [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=65.78s)]
*  of interest. We're dealing with a large area that we are making sure it's safe before we [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=71.25999999999999s)]
*  allow people to come back into the scene. If your vehicle is here in the several block [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=75.58s)]
*  perimeter that we have, please follow our social media. We will announce when the roads [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=81.82s)]
*  are open and people can retrieve their vehicle as well. I appreciate everyone's patience [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=85.58s)]
*  as we work through this complex scene. What I will say lastly is this was a beautiful [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=89.74s)]
*  Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street and this act is unacceptable. I hope [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=99.06s)]
*  you'll join me this evening as we're working through this investigation. We are working [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=106.74s)]
*  I just came from the command post. We've got dozens and dozens of people here, our state, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=111.5s)]
*  local and federal partners working through this to figure out exactly what happened. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=115.69999999999999s)]
*  I ask for a little bit of patience as we do that but also I ask that you join me in thinking [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  about our victims, the families of those victims and everyone involved in this tragedy. Our [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=125.61999999999999s)]
*  hearts go out to them and we are going to do everything we can to work as hard as we [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=131.01999999999998s)]
*  can throughout the evening to provide more information to get answers for everyone. With [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=136.29999999999998s)]
*  that, as I stated, it would be irresponsible for me to speculate right now on motive and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=141.14s)]
*  other things. I will take maybe a handful of questions and then I've got to go back [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=146.5s)]
*  to a briefing. I had a quick one. Yes, Sean. Was an actual protest going on when this occurred [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=150.66s)]
*  or a group of people gathered and were words said that would indicate this had anything [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=156.66s)]
*  at all to do with that protest? So what I will tell you on Pearl Street, it's a walking [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=161.77999999999997s)]
*  pedestrian mall downtown here. There was a lot of people out. Very beautiful day. There [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=165.45999999999998s)]
*  was a group of pro-Israel people that were there in a peaceful demonstration. I wouldn't [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=170.1s)]
*  even call it a protest. I believe that happens frequently down here. They were there in that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=175.46s)]
*  area. We are looking and actively interviewing victims and witnesses to determine if that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=180.74s)]
*  group was targeted or others and we just don't have those answers yet. Those are things we [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=185.38s)]
*  hope to be able to provide you later this evening. FBI is already calling it a targeted [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=189.26s)]
*  terror attack. Would you also refer to it as a terror attack? So I've been in contact [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=193.5s)]
*  with our local FBI multiple times. We are in contact with them here. We are not calling [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=198.26s)]
*  it a terror attack at this point. Again, it's way too early to speculate motive. I know [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=203.01999999999998s)]
*  there's a lot out there on social media, but I ask people just to give us a little bit [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=207.82s)]
*  of patience while we work through a really complex scene. A lot of witnesses were here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=210.54s)]
*  We've taken them to another location to debrief them and interview them. As we do that, I [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=215.82s)]
*  think the picture will become more clear, but it would be irresponsible for me to speculate [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=220.14s)]
*  on motive this early on. We're only a couple hours into this thing. I'll go right here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=225.98s)]
*  I haven't seen it. Obviously I wasn't here when he was arrested. All I know is it's an [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=237.33999999999997s)]
*  adult male. We're working to identify that person. We're working to figure out where [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=241.45999999999998s)]
*  they're from and we're in contact with our federal partners as well as we figure that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=244.82s)]
*  out. That is being investigated as well. So what we, our initial call is that we're [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=249.42s)]
*  looking for, as I mentioned, was a report that someone was setting people on fire. That [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=256.02s)]
*  is fairly consistent with the injuries that we found on scene, but we're not 100 percent [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  certain how that happened and that's what we're doing to interview. There's a lot of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=262.9s)]
*  witnesses that we're interviewing. I suspect within this evening, I suspect we'll have [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=266.98s)]
*  a better idea of exactly how those injuries occurred. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=271.24s)]
*  So what I will say is, again, I cannot confirm right now that this was targeted at a specific [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=286.42s)]
*  group of people. We understand that there's a lot of tensions right now and a lot of issues [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=290.18s)]
*  in the United States and everywhere. Once we have a clear motive, we will react accordingly [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=294.54s)]
*  and if that motive was a group was targeted, we will absolutely step up and ensure that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  additional security, additional presence. We want people to feel safe no matter what [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=304.66s)]
*  they're here for. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  How many people were injured? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=310.06s)]
*  I don't have an exact number. What I will say is multiple. I can confirm that Boulder [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=312.26s)]
*  Community Hospital received multiple patients and some of those patients were transferred [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=317.34000000000003s)]
*  to other hospitals. Right now, we have detectives working to find out specifically the number. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=321.94s)]
*  Again, hopefully later this evening, we'll have an exact number. Right now, I'll just [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  say multiple. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=330.22s)]
*  Any life threatening injuries? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=331.22s)]
*  I'll take like one more question. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=332.22s)]
*  Any life threatening injuries? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=333.22s)]
*  I believe so. What I'm being told is there are a range of injuries from very serious [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=334.3s)]
*  to more minor. And again, I just, my heart goes out to those victims and we're keeping [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=338.5s)]
*  them in our thoughts, prayers and minds as they recover. I got to go back to the command [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=344.54s)]
*  post. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=349.22s)]
*  I'll tell you that we are going to have another update later tonight. We will post that out [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=350.22s)]
*  and we will live stream it as well. So look, follow our social media for the next update. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=355.62s)]
*  We will have another update for you this evening. Thank you. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=358.9s)]
*  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for interrupting the program to bring you [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=362.22s)]
*  that breaking news, but to give you a little bit of context as to what you were listening [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=369.70000000000005s)]
*  to there, that was the chief of Boulder Police, Chief Steven Redfarm, who was briefing reporters [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=373.98s)]
*  in Boulder about an incident that he is describing, an attack that took place in Boulder, Colorado [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=380.74s)]
*  an attack that has resulted in what he described multiple injuries, including some that are [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=388.3s)]
*  life threatening as well as some that are minor. We have been hearing as well from FBI [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=394.94s)]
*  officials who say that they are investigating this as an act of terror. The police chief [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=401.18s)]
*  did not go that far yet. He was asked specifically about whether or not a group of Jewish pro-Israel [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=406.82s)]
*  protesters or demonstrators were targeted. He said he was not able to make that determination [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=413.46s)]
*  as of now, but said that is being investigated. The injuries were consistent with what the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=419.5s)]
*  calls that came into the police were, that people were set on fire or people were being [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=425.74s)]
*  set on fire and there were burns, there were victims that were consistent with burns as [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  he described it. So we'll have more information on that as you heard there at the very end [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=436.47999999999996s)]
*  of it. There was going to be another briefing that was going to be broadcast later on in [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=441.54s)]
*  the evening as they get more details. One person has been taken into custody. The area [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=446.26000000000005s)]
*  in Boulder remains unsafe, according to the police chief. There is a vehicle in the area [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=451.22s)]
*  that at this time is of interest, according to Chief Redfarm. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-dFXsKJZc&t=456.3s)]
