# Trump turning up heat on Hamas to release all hostages by Saturday
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA)
*  Joining me now, Aaron David Miller, a former Arab Israeli negotiator at the State Department, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=0.0s)]
*  now senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=5.0s)]
*  Aaron David, high stakes and urgent backdrop. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=8.48s)]
*  And President Trump turning up the pressure even more on Jordan and Egypt to take in the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=11.64s)]
*  Palestinians who would be displaced if they were relocated from their land in Gaza. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=15.32s)]
*  How is King Abdullah going to walk this tightrope today when half of his country's population [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=20.18s)]
*  is of Palestinian descent? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, Hamas or the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan is making a recovery [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=27.2s)]
*  as a consequence of what's happening in Jordan. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=32.84s)]
*  So the admission of large numbers of Palestinians and the hundreds of thousands, scores of thousands [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=35.12s)]
*  even is going to strain Jordan's stability. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=41.0s)]
*  Look, I think the king is trying to square an impossible circle. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=43.4s)]
*  A lot of it is up to the president. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=47.32s)]
*  If he follows through on his threat to suspend, restrict or withhold the $1.6 billion that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=49.12s)]
*  the U.S. gives to Jordan, the Jordanians are really have a major problem. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=59.8s)]
*  I have a feeling, though, that the king may well find a way to sort of dodge this proverbial [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  bullet. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=71.36s)]
*  Reuters is reporting that he's offered to take several thousand Palestinian children [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=72.36s)]
*  and he may up his interest and support for the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=77.96s)]
*  The president isn't going to give this up, though. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=84.19999999999999s)]
*  So the real question, I think, is Trump's, because Jordan will not agree under any circumstance [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=86.08s)]
*  to basically resettle on a permanent basis. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=93.63999999999999s)]
*  Thousands, scores of thousands of Palestinians in Jordan, thereby basically sending a signal [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=96.88s)]
*  to the Arab world that the Palestinian problem has now been resolved. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=102.8s)]
*  So the president's going to have to demonstrate a little flexibility here, not to press the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=107.12s)]
*  king and threaten to cut off aid. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=112.68s)]
*  I think that would be a major, major mistake on the part of the administration. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  And the reporting that you're mentioning there from Reuters seems to have been something [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=121.76s)]
*  they spoke about in the room between the king of Jordan and President Trump, where the king [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=125.4s)]
*  of Jordan effectively said, we can take in 12,000 children and then wait for Egyptians [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=129.72s)]
*  to present plans on other challenges. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=134.24s)]
*  So the president is actually pitching the ball over to the Egyptians court when they [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=137.72s)]
*  have their own negotiations on this with the president. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=142.28s)]
*  But all of this is happening against the backdrop of that tenuous ceasefire and hostage release [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=144.96s)]
*  deal. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=149.84s)]
*  What do these negotiations, these conversations and frankly, the doubling down by both [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=150.84s)]
*  President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on that Saturday deadline, what [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=154.96s)]
*  does it mean for a ceasefire that was already so fragile? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=159.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  You have a Mexican standoff. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=164.56s)]
*  On Saturday, the president has this basically made a statement that if all the hostages [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  aren't released and who cares about the ceasefire, he dismissed it by noon on Saturday. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=172.08s)]
*  So the prime minister appears to have split the difference. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=178.8s)]
*  The fact that 12 o'clock appeared in the prime minister's statement is clearly a direct effort [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=182.16s)]
*  to incorporate at least part of what the president said. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=187.32s)]
*  What is not clear to me, because I'm not sure it was clear in the statement, which was [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=190.68s)]
*  translated from the Hebrew as to whether or not the prime minister is saying that the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  remaining hostages in phase one have to be released on Saturday or just three, according [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  to the agreement. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=206.48s)]
*  In any event, you now have a situation where one of the two will have to back down or both. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=208.4s)]
*  Otherwise, we're not going to make it through phase one. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  The ceasefire is going to collapse. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  The surge of humanitarian assistance and Gaza is going to end, the release of Palestinians, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=224.12s)]
*  prisoners is going to end, and the Israelis and Hamas will find themselves once again [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=228.52s)]
*  locked into a conflict and a struggle. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=233.68s)]
*  Frankly, neither is going to win. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=236.52s)]
*  And that, I think, is the end state here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=238.28s)]
*  Hamas is going to survive in some form, not as an organized military force, but as an [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=240.68s)]
*  insurgency if the Israelis stay able to influence developments, politics in Gaza. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=246.32s)]
*  So again, the big loser here, without a doubt. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=254.08s)]
*  It's not the government of Israel. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=258.56s)]
*  It's not Hamas. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=260.56s)]
*  It's the 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza who have been relocated, disrupted three, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=262.1s)]
*  four, five times. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=268.8s)]
*  They are the big losers. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=270.48s)]
*  And right now, their future looks pretty bleak. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=271.48s)]
*  Because I think the larger question here for the region, as we see what's going on in Washington, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=276.04s)]
*  as one of the epicenters of this negotiation, is the larger concern about destabilization [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=280.16s)]
*  in the region. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=285.28s)]
*  I mean, what are your thoughts there? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=286.28s)]
*  I mean, I think it's true. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=288.12s)]
*  Look, again, I think the president's Gaza gambit in one fell swoop has associated the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=289.88s)]
*  United States with an idea that at best could be described as transfer at worst, according [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=296.8s)]
*  to the Palestinians, as ethnic cleansing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=303.64s)]
*  He's undermined both Egypt and Jordan, risked their political stability by demanding that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=306.24s)]
*  they absorb hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=311.36s)]
*  He's validated the fantasies of the Israeli right, who are only too happy with the president's [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=315.56s)]
*  pronouncements. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=320.91999999999996s)]
*  And frankly, he's sent a very bad signal. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  As an American, I would argue a very bad signal to both President Xi of China and Putin of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  Russia, basically saying, well, you give a press conference, you declare you want to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=333.2s)]
*  take over, quote unquote, a piece of territory without any justification. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=337.44s)]
*  By and large, I think this is a untethered, provocative sort of proposal that is only [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  going to pile on the already fraught realities that exist in many states in this region, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=351.12s)]
*  and certainly in the corner of the region we're now talking about. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=358.12s)]
