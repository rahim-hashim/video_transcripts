Video Description: Hungary’s current political system is “a kind of fake democracy,” says historian Anne Applebaum. “There's the appearance of democracy, but behind it, the systems are very hollow.” Trump’s allies have said they aim to model the U.S. in Hungary’s image, creating a political system within which they can never lose. People who suffer the most are Hungarians,” says Applebaum.

# Republicans aim to model U.S. after Hungary’s ‘fake democracy’

*  Orban and America's MAGA right see themselves as part of that same coalition. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=25.96s)]
*  Orban said in his speech quote the Trump tsunami swept through the entire world [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=30.240000000000002s)]

*  rhetoric and his embrace of culture wars it's easy to see why the American right [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=40.0s)]
*  adores Orban and sees him as a blueprint for politics here at home. Orban has [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=44.56s)]
*  transformed Hungary since returning to office in 2010 in ways that parallel [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=49.040000000000006s)]

*  likely to lose his grip on power anytime soon and that lead last bit is the key. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=76.68s)]
*  Orban hasn't canceled elections he's not ever declared Hungary a dictatorship [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=82.2s)]
*  he's built a competitive authoritarian state where democratic infrastructure [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=87.52s)]
*  still exists but has been rendered unfair and he's done it by marginalizing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=91.6s)]
*  dissent and reorganizing the country's institutions to serve him. Technically [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=96.16s)]
*  anyone can run for office in Hungary but Orban's party has made it harder for his [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=101.24s)]
*  opposition to win seats or raise money. Campaigns have a hard time getting [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  covered in the news because nearly 80% of Hungary's media market is controlled by [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  Orban friendly oligarchs according to reporters without borders. But the whole [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=113.0s)]
*  thing is wrapped in plausible deniability which allows Hungary to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  remain a member of NATO and the European Union. Kevin Roberts the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=121.03999999999999s)]

*  Hungary quote modern Hungary is not just a model for conservative statecraft but [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  the model. The right is always looking to the east so maybe we should too. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=135.04s)]
*  Joining me now is the Pulitzer Prize winning historian Anne Applebaum. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=140.8s)]

*  books including Autocracy Inc. Dictators Who Want to Run the World and welcome. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=155.84s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=159.76s)]
*  Thanks for having me. The NPR had a report from Hungary where they spoke to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=162.12s)]
*  a prominent journalist who heads a journalism school in a university in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  Budapest and he was saying he said quote there is only one thing that is needed [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  to separate Viktor Orban from power and that is a relatively a relative majority [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=176.12s)]
*  of Hungarians voting for someone else other than him. That's all that's needed [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  and as long as that's the case how can you speak of an autocracy. That's not as [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=184.12s)]
*  simple as that in Hungary. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=189.96s)]
*  No it very much isn't as simple as that and I would also say that in your [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=193.04s)]
*  excellent introduction you left out a couple of really important things to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=196.96s)]
*  understand about Hungary. One is that it's become much poorer and it's also [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  become much more corrupt and the way that money works in Hungary is actually [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  frightening. Hungary was a most promising member of the former communist [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=211.32s)]
*  world 20 years ago. Now it's either depending on how you count the poorest [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=215.64s)]
*  or the second poorest country in the EU. It's also a country where a very small [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  group of companies has privileged access to the state to state money to to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=225.04s)]
*  contracts. All those companies have somehow links to Orban. You mentioned [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=229.6s)]
*  also in your introduction that many of them control the media. They control [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  other institutions. You know what Orban has done is tilted the playing field so [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=238.67999999999998s)]
*  that a few companies, the ones owned by his son-in-law or by his friends, have an [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=244.12s)]
*  advantage over the others. He's eliminated most of the media and he's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=248.60000000000002s)]
*  working on actually eliminating the rest. Maybe we can talk about that. There's a [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=252.96s)]
*  new law coming up in the next few, very soon, which is which is designed to help [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  do that. He's tilted the courts. He's repeatedly rewritten the Constitution to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  give him and his party all kinds of advantages. So he actually doesn't win [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=265.88s)]
*  majorities in elections, but the way the law, the Constitution is written, he [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=270.08s)]
*  somehow has a majority in Parliament afterwards. People who have dared to be [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  his opponents run into all kinds of trouble. They lose their jobs. They're [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  harassed. They're followed in the street. I was actually in Budapest not that long [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=283.36s)]
*  ago and met people who are part of a new opposition movement against him and they [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=288.76s)]
*  really tell horror stories. So it's increasingly a system that is a [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=293.52s)]
*  kind of fake democracy. So there's the appearance of democracy, but behind it [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  the systems are very hollow and as I said, the people who suffer from it [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=303.56s)]
*  most are the Hungarians. What's the thing that American [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  conservatives are enchanted with? Is it the system that you just described or is [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=312.0s)]
*  it the underlying politics? Because Orban is an ethno-nationalist. Orban is [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  anti-immigrant. Orban is anti-gay rights and things like that. So in other words, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=321.52s)]
*  there are two points of intersection here. Are they both working with American [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=326.92s)]
*  conservatives or is it the idea that this guy knows how to control a society? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=330.44s)]
*  So I do think it's both. I think you're right. One of them is that Orban has [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=335.56s)]
*  successfully used culture wars to cover up other problems. So Hungarian politics [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=339.76s)]
*  is all about immigrants who in fact in Hungary don't exist. I mean, there isn't [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=345.64s)]
*  an immigration problem in Hungary or threats from some kind of gender ideology [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  that doesn't really exist there either, but has given him the excuse to take [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=355.8s)]
*  over universities, for example, and to destroy academic programs. And he's used [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=359.72s)]
*  those to hide the fact that as I say, Hungary's getting poorer, Hungarian [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=365.40000000000003s)]
*  healthcare system is getting worse. Hungarian emigration, Hungarians [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=368.8s)]
*  leaving the country is a very high number. Educated Hungarians don't want [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=373.68s)]
*  to stay there. And so the culture wars used as a kind of smoke screen to hide [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=377.48s)]
*  the country's real problems and prevent people from discussing or debating them. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=382.48s)]
*  And of course, then the other thing Orban has done that I'm afraid a part of the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=387.48s)]
*  American right admirers is set up a political system within which he never [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  loses. He doesn't ever pay a price. He doesn't lose an election. He's so [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=397.52s)]
*  manipulated the public sphere and so manipulated the electoral system that it's [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=403.76s)]
*  very, very hard if not impossible to beat him. I mean, I should say there is [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=408.40000000000003s)]
*  another opposition leader who right now is polling better than he is. And the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=412.48s)]
*  question is, will that person really be allowed to stand? And would he really be [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  allowed to win? And again, when I was in Budapest a month or two ago, that was [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=421.52000000000004s)]
*  the debate. We don't know whether a real opposition party would be allowed to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  win or whether he would be blocked. And these are interesting comparisons. You [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=430.64s)]
*  could use Turkey as an example. You can use India as an example where there are [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=434.12s)]
*  movements, there are frustrations. If you spend your time in Budapest, you'll [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=438.24s)]
*  think nobody likes Orban. And then you realize that, you know what, the rest of [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  the country he sweeps overwhelmingly. So these are these are interesting [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=444.2s)]
*  challenges that democracy still exists. And yet Orban doesn't doesn't lose and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  much to discuss here. Thank you for joining us as always. Thank you for your [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=454.8s)]
*  great writing on this. And Applebaum is a staff writer at the Atlantic, a senior [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=457.32s)]
*  fellow at Johns Hopkins Agora Institute and the author of numerous books, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i1MM1m1lb0&t=460.56s)]
