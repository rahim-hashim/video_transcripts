# Trump cashes in on crypto side hustle as rich-get-richer budget comes into focus
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk)
*  If you have kids like me, personal time is very hard to come by. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=0.0s)]
*  I certainly cherish it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  However, there is at least one person who is generally not afforded the privilege of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=6.08s)]
*  personal time. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  And that person is the president of the United States, no matter who they are. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  And before you feel bad for any moment, this is what presidents sign up for, all of them. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=15.9s)]
*  There are no on or off buttons for national crises or the all-encompassing responsibility [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=21.12s)]
*  of the presidency. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=26.26s)]
*  And there are also, importantly, no on or off buttons for when you need to follow the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=27.860000000000003s)]
*  law. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=32.1s)]
*  But for some reason, the Trump administration thinks there's an off button, especially [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=33.1s)]
*  when it comes to President Trump's money-making after-hours side hustles. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=37.86s)]
*  I mean, yesterday, when NBC News correspondent Garrett Haake asked to see a list of those [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=41.94s)]
*  invited to Trump's very private crypto dinner, where he honored the top 220 investors who [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=46.58s)]
*  funneled money into his family's meme coin, White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=52.68s)]
*  said that no disclosure was necessary, not at all, because President Trump was, quote, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=57.36s)]
*  attending in his personal time. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=62.64s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=65.08s)]
*  So then why is there reporting today that the official presidential seal was used at [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=66.08s)]
*  this very personal timey event? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=71.2s)]
*  If this dinner, which has already raised questions about potential room for bribery, was really [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=74.88s)]
*  held on Trump's personal time and not the taxpayers' time, why put on display the literal [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=78.96s)]
*  symbol of the public office Trump holds? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=85.8s)]
*  You can see it right there in the screen. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=88.63999999999999s)]
*  We even shined a little light on it there for you. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  Certainly there are a lot of people who were not happy with the president rubbing shoulders [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=92.88s)]
*  with a Chinese billionaire and over 200 others with largely foreign digital wallets, myself [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=96.32s)]
*  included, probably all of you watching right now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is how The New York Times put it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=103.24s)]
*  The dinner at which Trump gave remarks was an extraordinary moment in which the president [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=105.92s)]
*  leveraged his position to make money for his own crypto business and for his Virginia Golf [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=110.2s)]
*  Club. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=115.8s)]
*  Now late today, the Times got its hands on the guest list, which included crypto billionaires [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=117.28s)]
*  from around the world, former basketball player Lamar Odom, and a lawyer who worked for Supreme [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=121.64s)]
*  Court Justice Clarence Thomas, among many. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=127.44s)]
*  Interesting crowd, I guess. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  And those people on average spent $1.7 million each, each for a seat and an opportunity to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=132.92s)]
*  shape U.S. policy in their own interests. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=139.11999999999998s)]
*  $1.7 million. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  Now, I should note that is roughly 500 times the individual donation limit for federal [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=144.04s)]
*  elections. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=149.88s)]
*  You can see the numbers there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=150.88s)]
*  But somehow this is kosher, I guess, according to the Trump administration. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=152.5s)]
*  I mean, plenty of protesters also, you can see them there, stood outside of Trump's Virginia [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=158.2s)]
*  Golf Course where the event was being held, repeatedly and loudly chanting. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=163.32s)]
*  You hear them say, America is not for sale. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=167.04s)]
*  America is not for sale. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, the guests of honor were served this Trump special. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  You can see it on the screen there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  Not sure I'd spend over a million bucks to eat that, but to each his own. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=178.64s)]
*  And because there was so little transparency, it is unclear when the meme coin dinner ended [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=183.4s)]
*  and presumably when Trump switched from being on his personal time to, I guess, being the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=188.52s)]
*  president again. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=194.36s)]
*  We do know, though, that just after 7 a.m. this morning, when Trump was back on the clock [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=196.16s)]
*  officially in some capacity, he used the power of his office to threaten the EU with new [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=200.08s)]
*  50 percent tariffs and also threaten yet another American company with tariffs. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=205.0s)]
*  This time the target was Apple. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=210.4s)]
*  In a post on his social media site, Trump threatened the tech giant with a 25 percent [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=212.84s)]
*  tariff that Apple does not start producing iPhones in the United States. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=217.08s)]
*  If you prefer Android phones and think you lucked out, think again on that one, because [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=221.28s)]
*  today Trump said the 25 percent tariff would apply to companies like Samsung, too. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=225.32s)]
*  Now I'm not sure if Trump knows that some experts estimate that a Made in America iPhone [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  could cost triple the price it is now, or maybe he doesn't care because he already has one. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=235.4s)]
*  What I'm about to play for you here is not from the show Veep at all. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=241.24s)]
*  It is something that actually happened in the Oval Office today. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=246.0s)]
*  But we don't want to have Canada making that cost. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  We want to make that cost. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  It's a phone call. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  Do you mind? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  Hello? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=256.92s)]
*  Mr. President, are you considering stopping other universities from taking foreign students? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=257.92s)]
*  No. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=262.92s)]
*  It's a different congress. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=263.92s)]
*  They're all congratulating us. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=265.92s)]
*  Is that an iPhone, sir? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=268.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=271.76s)]
*  Lucky it is. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=272.76s)]
*  Lucky it is? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=273.76s)]
*  That was literally today after he threatened the tariffs that will make phones much more [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=274.76s)]
*  expensive for everybody else. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=279.96000000000004s)]
*  Look, it's clear the Trump agenda is not all that concerned with growing income inequality [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=281.6s)]
*  and the cost of living in this country. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, every day, that's pretty clear. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=287.76s)]
*  Trump's actions and the Republican budget bill we've been talking about a lot over the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  last couple of days kind of tells us everything we need to know on that front. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=293.6s)]
*  Just look at this chart from G.E. Elliott Morris on Substack. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=298.32s)]
*  It outlines the rate of change in household income that would come as a result of the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=301.12s)]
*  Republican budget bill that was passed in the House yesterday. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=305.08s)]
*  This is pretty startling. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=308.08s)]
*  I mean, the poorest 10% of Americans represented on the left side in the red, you can see them [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=309.08s)]
*  in the red, show a negative increase. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=314.16s)]
*  Their household incomes are estimated to be reduced by 2% in just two years. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=317.0s)]
*  Now, the further right you go on the chart, that's the one you can see very well, the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=321.2s)]
*  more wealth those Americans have. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  For example, for the richest 10%, their income will increase by 4% in two years. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=327.92s)]
*  And believe it or not, this is just one very small piece of that chart. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  See, look at what happens to the top 0.1% on the far right if we scroll up a bit and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=336.8s)]
*  just how far up it goes, up and up and up. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=342.08000000000004s)]
*  We couldn't even fit it in the initial screen. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=345.8s)]
*  Disparity here is undeniably stark. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=349.24s)]
*  I mean, under the Trump and Republican budget, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=351.76s)]
*  That's about the summary of what this is. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=357.36s)]
*  And oh yeah, how about some random tariffs that will raise prices on everything you buy [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=359.12s)]
*  while we're at it? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekcQJ0B1Ntk&t=362.88s)]
