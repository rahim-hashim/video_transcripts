# Trump pick to head IRS raises red flags with sketchy ties, disappearing debt
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ)
*  So, Donald Trump's nominee to lead the IRS is this man. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=0.0s)]
*  His name is Billy Long. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=5.8s)]
*  He is not an accountant. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  He's not a tax lawyer. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  He has no background in tax, like, you know, like bookkeeping or math or anything that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  would be a typical credential for somebody who was appointed to lead the IRS. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=18.44s)]
*  His only relevant credential appears to be that he used to be a member of Congress. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=21.96s)]
*  He then tried to run for Senate in 2022, and he lost his Senate race. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=26.44s)]
*  Billy Long is one of the last big Trump nominees who has not yet been confirmed. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  And that's bad timing because, hoo, boy, the work is really piling up over at the IRS. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  But look at this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=42.28s)]
*  Just this week, two Democratic senators on the Finance Committee wrote to the IRS asking [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=43.28s)]
*  the agency to open a criminal investigation into a handful of companies that they say [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=47.08s)]
*  have been selling tax credits that don't actually exist. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=52.44s)]
*  And that obviously is problematic on its face, but it's even more concerning that Billy Long, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=58.2s)]
*  Trump's choice to run the IRS, has, quote, direct financial ties to some of the companies [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=62.28s)]
*  implicated in this alleged scheme. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=68.84s)]
*  The senators write that one of the companies, a company called Lifetime Advisors, hired [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  Billy Long to do substantial work for it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=75.88s)]
*  The senators say the other company, called White River Energy, paid Billy Long thousands [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=78.48s)]
*  of dollars for some kind of referral fee. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=82.68s)]
*  Now, the senators say that it's unclear what role, if any, Billy Long played in promoting [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=85.04s)]
*  these bogus tax credits that allegedly don't exist. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=90.68s)]
*  But either way, these senators want the IRS to launch a criminal investigation into these [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=93.92s)]
*  firms that ran what they called a fraudulent scheme, including these firms that reportedly [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=98.04s)]
*  have direct financial ties to Trump's pick to run the IRS. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=105.32s)]
*  And you kind of wish that was the end of the story, but of course it isn't. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  I mentioned that Billy Long tried to run for Senate and lost a couple of years ago. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=113.6s)]
*  During that race, Billy Long loaned his campaign a bunch of his own personal money. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  And when he lost, the campaign was in debt, which means the campaign owed money to Billy, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=124.46s)]
*  to him personally. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=130.12s)]
*  He's out of it, out of pocket himself. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=131.12s)]
*  As of last year, two years out from that failed Senate campaign, Billy Long was still in the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=134.12s)]
*  hole by a lot. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=137.96s)]
*  $130,000 he had given to his campaign. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=139.96s)]
*  His campaign had never been able to pay it back. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=142.08s)]
*  And that's where this really gets interesting, because, let's see, November, Trump gets [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=145.08s)]
*  elected president. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  December, he announces Billy Long is his choice to run the IRS. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  And then look what happens next. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=154.24s)]
*  Quote, after Trump named Billy Long to head the IRS, Long's campaign committee suddenly [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=156.84s)]
*  raked in nearly $137,000 in less than three weeks in January, money that Long then used [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=162.72s)]
*  to pay himself back, according to disclosure documents filed this week. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=169.76s)]
*  This was reported by the news organization The Lever this week. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=174.84s)]
*  But I mean, great news for Billy, right? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=179.38s)]
*  He got all his money back. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=180.76s)]
*  Trump gets elected in November. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=182.0s)]
*  He names Billy in December. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=184.24s)]
*  January, ka-ching! [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=186.04s)]
*  Right after Trump names him to run the IRS, all of a sudden that longstanding debt, money [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=189.16s)]
*  owed to Billy, gets paid off. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  Where did that money come from? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=195.76s)]
*  Quote, at least one-third of the money came from donors working at firms in the tax consultancy [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=196.76s)]
*  industry, or involved in major tax-related legal battles, including financial advisors [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=201.48s)]
*  for White River Energy and Lifetime Advisors. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=206.24s)]
*  Those are the ones that paid Billy Long thousands of dollars, who two U.S. senators say should [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=209.5s)]
*  be investigated by the IRS for fraud. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=213.98s)]
*  All his debts cleared! [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=219.0s)]
*  Amazing! [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=221.2s)]
*  Right after he gets picked to run the IRS. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=222.56s)]
*  We asked for comment from Billy Long and from the companies involved. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=226.76s)]
*  We have not heard back. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=229.52s)]
*  We'll let you know if we do. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxs_TVN5vQ&t=230.52s)]
