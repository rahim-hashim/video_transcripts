# This is 'antisemitism, period, full stop': 8 injured in attack on advocates for Israeli hostages
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA)
*  NBC's Camilla Bernal is in Boulder for us. Also here with me, the president of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, Amy Spitalnik, and former FBI counterterrorism official Christopher O'Leary. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=0.0s)]
*  Amy, I just want to get your reaction to that, to hear a friend of one of the victims say she was a Holocaust survivor and now having her life threatened in 2025 in Boulder, Colorado. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=12.0s)]
*  It feels unfathomable, but it's become increasingly normalized. Look, the Jewish community was already feeling so vulnerable after the last few months, after the last few years, and frankly after the last decade in which we've seen an exponential increase in anti-Semitism. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=24.0s)]
*  This attack yesterday comes on the heels of a shooting less than a week and a half ago outside the Capitol Jewish Museum that took a young couple. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=38.0s)]
*  A month before that, we saw the firebombing of a Jewish governor's home in Pennsylvania with Josh Shapiro in both cases, and now this one seems Jews were targeted as a result of the perpetrators' belief that they should be held accountable for the actions of the Israeli government. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=46.0s)]
*  And we should make no mistake, targeting Jews for the actions of the Israeli government is anti-Semitism, period, full stop. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=61.0s)]
*  I know you spoke to someone locally in Boulder. I know you talk to people in the community all the time. What's the level of fear? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=68.0s)]
*  The Jewish community is fearful. We know that this is the result of an increasing normalization of this sort of anti-Semitism, this belief that Jews here are fair game for protests, for targeting, for... [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=75.0s)]
*  Fair game. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=89.0s)]
*  And it's deeply disturbing. And we have to understand it also in the broader context of the anti-Semitism that we've been seeing normalized over the last decade. That includes hate crimes targeting visible Jews on the streets in Brooklyn and around the country. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=90.0s)]
*  It includes a cycle of anti-Semitic and white supremacist mass shootings, including in Pittsburgh, the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in U.S. history that goes hand in hand with normalized conspiracy theories. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=102.0s)]
*  It includes the isolation and marginalization of Jews in certain spaces, including on certain college campuses intending to discriminate against Jews because of their perceived relationship with Israel. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=113.0s)]
*  And so none of this is happening in a vacuum. It's part of this increasingly mainstreamed and normalized anti-Semitism that threatens not just Jews, but each and every community in the very fabric of our democracy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=124.0s)]
*  Camilla, what more details do we have at this hour? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=135.0s)]
*  Hey, Chris. So the suspect identified as Mohammed Solomon. He was an Egyptian national and the Department of Homeland Security saying he was in the country illegally, later clarifying that after his visa expired, he did apply for a visa. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=139.0s)]
*  He was in a prison for asylum, so he had not exhausted all of his avenues to be legal in this country. But he's potentially facing two murder charges, although the authorities here did clarify that no one died as a result of this attack. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=154.0s)]
*  He's also potentially facing a number of other charges, including attempted murder, assault, using an explosive weapon. There's a number of them. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=169.0s)]
*  He is expected to be in court at around 1 30 p.m. local time here, and he is currently being held on a $10 million bond. Take a listen to what the Colorado attorney general had to say about him. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=177.0s)]
*  This has every single harm rock of being a hate crime. How that will get held up either in the federal or the state cases remains to be seen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=189.0s)]
*  There are enhanced penalties, not just for hate crimes, but for attacking older Coloradans. Most of the individuals were older. This was a peaceful march done every single week by the Jewish community calling out the injustices of the hostages, and they were attacked because of who they are. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=201.0s)]
*  And this all happened at around 1 30 p.m. local time yesterday. That group was gathering in the area here behind me when all of a sudden this man shows up. He is yelling free Palestine. He is attacking them with these makeshift flamethrowers, of course, causing chaos. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=217.0s)]
*  People calling 911 running to help some of these victims. I saw on the videos people who were rushing in with water trying to help some of these victims saying this is one of the worst moments of their lives as they watch this all unfold. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=233.0s)]
*  A lot of people after they called 911 were able to identify this suspect. So when authorities got here, they knew exactly who it was. I spoke to an officer that told me he was the fourth one here, and they immediately knew who their suspect was. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=247.0s)]
*  They were able to get him on the ground and arrest him very quickly, but close this area off for a long period of time. Yesterday, this morning, we were seeing them still in this area here behind me pressure cleaning because you could still see some of the burn marks on the ground. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=260.0s)]
*  On the videos you saw some of the fire also on the grass in this area. So again, just very chaotic for the people that were here. And we're now seeing this community and really the Jewish community coming together to support the victims of the eight. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=276.0s)]
*  We know one is in critical condition and officials did warn that burn injuries are very complicated and difficult because they can get worse and be life threatening. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=291.0s)]
*  Chris Camilla, thank you for that. So, um, Chris, the FBI is one of multiple agencies working on this, right? So we're not even 24 hours in what's happening right now in terms of the investigation. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=301.0s)]
*  Well, the FBI is the lead in this because this is terrorism. This is terrorism is the use of violence or threat of violence to attain a political, religious or ideological goal. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=313.0s)]
*  This is clearly that the FBI has the authorities to work terrorism both domestically in the United States and around the world. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=325.0s)]
*  So the first thing they're going to be doing is checking to see information that he provided on his visa application on his asylum application. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=332.0s)]
*  I'm trying to find his bed down location where he was staying in the area seeking search warrants to conduct searches, looking at his social media. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=341.0s)]
*  Footprint and his digital profile and exploiting all of that information, conducting interviews, trying to piece together how he got there, how we procured the precursors that made this device that anybody helped him create this very unusual device. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=350.0s)]
*  And at the same time, working with, you know, both the Egyptian intelligence partners and the Israelis trying to find out if this individual was a terrorist or not. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=363.0s)]
*  And then also looking internally, is there something that was missed? Is this somebody that the FBI or others should have known about and have been looking out for? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=375.0s)]
*  And did we miss him because there's a pivot towards immigration and other matters? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=385.0s)]
*  And that's been going on already. Even before this administration, there's been a pivot towards other priorities and other things that we've been looking at. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=391.0s)]
*  And the last point I'll make is, as Amy and I were talking about before we came on, this was predictable. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=400.0s)]
*  This type of violence was predictable coming out of the Gaza conflict. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=406.0s)]
*  I understand it was predictable, but and you can correct me on this. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=412.0s)]
*  It sounded like this device or what he was using to set people on fire was not sufficient. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=416.0s)]
*  It's something that people could obtain. It's not like making a bomb, right? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=423.0s)]
*  That, again, somebody who didn't seem to be on the radar of officials, he doesn't seem to have a record. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=428.0s)]
*  His online profile does not seem to be voluminous. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=436.0s)]
*  So how do you even know that someone like this is going to do this? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=441.0s)]
*  Or are we at a point where any place where Jews gather, you just have to amp up the security? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=446.0s)]
*  Well, I think Amy can speak to that probably better. But any public event right now, I would be concerned. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=454.0s)]
*  And I would definitely, if I was a state and local law enforcement partner, be looking to protect those communities. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=461.0s)]
*  And what we were talking about is that there's a lot of people who are not going to be able to do that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=468.0s)]
*  And what we were talking about is this splinter towards violence. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=473.0s)]
*  The protests on campus and other protests over the last couple of years by some were considered ineffective. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=478.0s)]
*  And they were either ignored or just, you know, the conflict continues. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=486.0s)]
*  So if you look back to Vietnam, students for a democratic society protesting on Colombia to end the Vietnam War were ineffective, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=493.0s)]
*  according to some components of that group. They split off to form the weather underground, conducted bombings across the United States. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=500.0s)]
*  That splintered into many more groups. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=507.0s)]
*  Now it might be one individual like this man or a small group who think that they have to take action and they believe they're going to be the vanguard to make others pay attention now, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=509.0s)]
*  because it's symbolic in nature and what they're doing. That's how political violence and terrorism works in a lot of cases. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=521.0s)]
*  People have in kind of the modern era have looked at terrorism and conflated every terrorist act with 9-11 and global jihadism. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=527.0s)]
*  Terrorism in the United States has primarily come from the left throughout our history. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=536.0s)]
*  And that brings me full circle, Amy, to a witness I spoke with on this network last night who actually rushed in to help. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=541.0s)]
*  Here's part of what he told me. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=551.0s)]
*  I'm familiar with the event. I'm Jewish myself. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=554.0s)]
*  I've never attended any one of these events that happen all across the country just simply due to the fear of something like this actually happening. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=556.0s)]
*  I'm a bit more saddened and pessimistic about what this means for us as Jewish people, what it means for our future in this country, what it means for how this trend is going. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=565.0s)]
*  The fear that I think a lot of my friends and family all have with the different hate crimes that are happening all across the country that we hear of, that we talk about in our own social groups, those kinds of things. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=580.0s)]
*  I think that's what's the scariest part of all of this. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=593.0s)]
*  So it comes down to, in this world order, how do you balance the right of people to have expressed their deeply held beliefs that may, in this case, be related to their faith, but not everyone, apparently, who walks this peace walk is Jewish, and balance that with safety. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=596.0s)]
*  Where does that leave the Jewish people? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=618.0s)]
*  Well, look, one of the most important things is to make sure that Jews and, frankly, all people can still keep showing up fully as their authentic selves proudly, practicing their religion, expressing their political opinions, whatever it may be. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=621.0s)]
*  And the point of this extremism, the point of this sort of terrorism, is to prevent that, to scare people away from showing up, from speaking out. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=632.0s)]
*  And we heard from that young mannequin work, right? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=640.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=642.0s)]
*  So one of the most important things we can do is actually make sure we're both investing in the security that our communities need. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=643.0s)]
*  For example, the nonprofit security grant program, which the Trump administration first slashed, it restored, but has not made an increase in, despite the really significant needs. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=648.0s)]
*  But we also need to be investing in the resiliency and the preventative measures. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=657.0s)]
*  Instead, this administration has slashed funding for the hate crimes prevention grants that prevent extremism and hate crimes from happening in the first place. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=661.0s)]
*  It slashed funding for the Office of Civil Rights, which is the office specifically tasked with protecting Jewish and all students on campus. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=669.0s)]
*  We've talked a lot about previously on the normalization of sort of the hatred and conspiracy theories among political leaders. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=676.0s)]
*  And so we need to be both building the physical security and safety that the Jewish community and all communities targeted right now require and investing in that. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=683.0s)]
*  But we also need to be building the broader resiliency to this hate and extremism becoming so normalized in the first place. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=692.0s)]
*  And that result that requires a whole of government and whole of society approach. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=698.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guxJaBK6ARA&t=722.0s)]
