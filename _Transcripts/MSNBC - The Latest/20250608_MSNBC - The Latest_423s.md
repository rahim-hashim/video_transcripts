# Trump administration defends deployment of National Guard in L.A. over immigration protests
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k)
*  David, what's happening where you are right now and how are the local lawmakers reacting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=0.0s)]
*  to the troops we see right behind you? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=4.1s)]
*  Yeah, Alex, so I am right outside the federal building in downtown LA, which is just across [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=7.92s)]
*  the street from the Metropolitan Detention Center. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=12.96s)]
*  This is where this group of about, at this point, the number of troops has grown since [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=15.52s)]
*  I last spoke to you, about two dozen National Guard troops with their vehicles have been [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=19.92s)]
*  stationed here all morning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=23.94s)]
*  There actually are traces of tear gas in the air. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=25.86s)]
*  I'm not entirely sure where it's coming from. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=28.16s)]
*  I don't know if it's residue from the last couple of days, but a number of people here [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=29.8s)]
*  have been kind of coughing and getting affected by it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=32.28s)]
*  In the last hour also, Alex, the tension has definitely gone up pretty significantly. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=36.28s)]
*  There are more protesters here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=40.56s)]
*  A number of them are sort of walking right up to the National Guard troops. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=42.04s)]
*  The troops have, on a couple of occasions now, tried to get people to move back out [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=45.260000000000005s)]
*  onto the street. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=49.0s)]
*  I'm told that there's a march moving here from Boyle Heights, from Mariachi Plaza specifically, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=50.0s)]
*  which is this sort of iconic, it's an icon of the immigrant community here in Los Angeles. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=55.52s)]
*  As to your question about lawmakers, Alex, actually just a few minutes before we went [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=60.24s)]
*  to air, spoke with Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who represents a district in South LA where [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  a lot of the activity has been over the last couple of days. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=70.28s)]
*  She told me that she, just in the last hour, tried to gain access to the Metropolitan Detention [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=73.08s)]
*  Center but was turned away by people who worked there who did not identify themselves to her. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  So this is the second time in two days, Alex, that sitting members of U.S. Congress have [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=81.92s)]
*  been turned away from this detention center, which they have a legal right to visit for [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=86.48s)]
*  oversight purposes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=92.18s)]
*  Now, I asked her about her feeling about everything that's happening, the fact that the troops [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=93.18s)]
*  are here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=97.18s)]
*  Take a listen to a little bit of what she told me. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=98.18s)]
*  I think now I'm going to go out into the community to see if ICE is doing what it did last night. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=99.18s)]
*  They issued tear gas out in these communities. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=106.92s)]
*  I'm worried about what they possibly can do or what will happen. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=110.92s)]
*  So I'm going to be around. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=114.92s)]
*  I may try to come back. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=116.92s)]
*  I'm going to try and call more elected officials to come out here because of these guards with [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=118.92s)]
*  these guns. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=124.92s)]
*  I'm really frightened about the guns. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=125.92s)]
*  I think one of these young kids might get excited, might get frightened, and might use [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=127.92s)]
*  those guns. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  Why would they bring guns here? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  Alex, I did get a statement back from the Department of Homeland Security from Assistant [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  Secretary Tricia McLaughlin about why congressmen were turned away from this detention center [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=139.92s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=144.92s)]
*  She told me that at the time the lawmakers tried to enter the federal building, more [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=145.92s)]
*  than a thousand rioters had surrounded the building, and due to the rioting, the lawmakers [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=147.92s)]
*  were turned away in the interest of their safety and the safety of our law enforcement. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=151.92s)]
*  Of course, that was yesterday when Representative Waters tried to enter the detention facility [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=155.92s)]
*  today. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=159.92s)]
*  There was no... [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=160.92s)]
*  I mean, you know, this was the protest that you could see. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=161.92s)]
*  It was actually not really particularly close to the detention center. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=164.92s)]
*  I want to reach back out to them for comment about that turning away of an additional member [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=167.92s)]
*  of congress in this instance. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=170.92s)]
*  And as I mentioned to you last time, this also is happening as attorneys are also telling [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=172.92s)]
*  me that they've been turned away from this and other ICE detention centers where the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=176.92s)]
*  people who have been arrested are being held. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=179.92s)]
*  Alex, we're going to be here all day. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=182.92s)]
*  Just based on how much the tensions have risen in the last hour since I spoke to you, I think [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=184.92s)]
*  that likely they are going to continue to rise during the course of the day as more [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=189.92s)]
*  and more people gather here in downtown L.A. to protest the presence not only of ICE [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=192.92s)]
*  and other federal agencies conducting immigration enforcement, but now also in a historical [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=196.92s)]
*  event that hasn't happened in many decades, the presence also of National Guard troops [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=201.92s)]
*  who are here without the authorization of the governor of California. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=204.92s)]
*  Alex. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=207.92s)]
*  Well, listen, David, if they're coming in from Boyle Heights there, which is east of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=208.92s)]
*  where you are by just about three miles, if you were going to go on the 101 freeway, they [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=211.92s)]
*  will be there soon. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=215.92s)]
*  It is not far. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=217.92s)]
*  Certainly they're not going to be going along the freeway, but they will be making their [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=218.92s)]
*  way soon to you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=221.92s)]
*  Keep a very close watch. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=223.92s)]
*  Let us know if we need to come back to you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=224.92s)]
*  Thank you so much, David. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=225.92s)]
*  Let's go now to NBC's Gabe Gutierrez with new reaction from the White House today. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=226.92s)]
*  So, Gabe, why did the Trump administration circumvent the California governor to send [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=230.92s)]
*  in the National Guard? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=235.92s)]
*  Well, certainly, Alex, this is something that President Trump has railed against for quite [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=236.92s)]
*  some time, this idea that Democrat-led cities in the administration's view don't pay enough [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=241.92s)]
*  attention to law and order and the images you're seeing right now of National Guard [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=247.92s)]
*  troops on the ground in a major American city is what the White House wants to see, and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=253.92s)]
*  they want that message to get across that they are taking this immigration crackdown [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=258.91999999999996s)]
*  seriously. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=262.91999999999996s)]
*  Now, we also heard from administration officials throughout the day, including Homeland Security [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  Secretary Christine Ohm, who was interviewed this morning. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=267.91999999999996s)]
*  Here was her justification for why the president deployed those troops. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=270.91999999999996s)]
*  Listen. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  At the direction of the president in order to keep peace and allow people to be able [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=277.92s)]
*  to protest, but also to keep law in order. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=282.92s)]
*  That is incredibly important to the president. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=285.92s)]
*  Governor Newsom has proven that he makes bad decisions. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=287.92s)]
*  The president knows that he makes bad decisions, and that's why the president chose the safety [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=290.92s)]
*  of this community over waiting for Governor Newsom to get some sanity. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=294.92s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why these National Guard soldiers have been federalized so they [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=298.92s)]
*  can use their special skill set to keep peace. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=304.92s)]
*  And Alex, I'm also just learning from my colleague, Kelly O'Donnell, who says that a White House [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=307.92s)]
*  official told her that the president actually spoke to Gavin Newsom on Friday and said that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=312.92s)]
*  he needed to get the police in gear because things were getting under control. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=320.92s)]
*  So that is some news that the president spoke directly to Gavin Newsom again on Friday at [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=325.92s)]
*  these protests were getting underway. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=330.92s)]
*  But this also should come as no surprise because the president has railed against not just [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=332.92s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, but also officials in Democrat-led cities really since the start of this [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=337.92s)]
*  administration, even going back to his first term. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=342.92s)]
*  And he has also tried to make it a point that, and his borders are Tom Homan has as well, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=345.92s)]
*  that if these local officials stand in the way of immigration enforcement that they will [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=351.92s)]
*  then be prosecuted. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=356.92s)]
*  Now, Tom Homan, in his interview with my colleague, Jacob Silveroff, did make it clear [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=357.92s)]
*  that Governor Newsom and the Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, had not crossed that line just [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=362.92s)]
*  yet, but he did make it clear that if they did, that they would be prosecuted. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=367.92s)]
*  But you see those live images right there of National Guard troops on the ground in [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=372.92s)]
*  Los Angeles waiting to see if there is any more escalation of those protests throughout [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=376.92s)]
*  this afternoon. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=382.92s)]
*  We'll certainly be watching. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=383.92s)]
*  And the administration is watching, too. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=384.92s)]
*  Again, though, the president had already spoken with Governor Gavin Newsom, and he [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=386.92s)]
*  deployed those troops, even despite Newsom's opposition, Alex. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=391.92s)]
*  Opposition, because Newsom said that we've got it under control and we can handle it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=396.92s)]
*  But there you have it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=399.92s)]
*  OK, thank you for that, Gabe. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=400.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5QXZvLS3k&t=416.92s)]
