# BREAKING: U.S. military helped Israel shoot down Iranian missiles
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs)
*  some of these missions we've been seeing here on our screen. What do you know? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=0.0s)]
*  Hi, Christina. Yes, that's right. We can now confirm, according to three U.S. officials, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=4.8s)]
*  that the U.S. has been helping in shooting down these Iranian missiles and projectiles [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=9.76s)]
*  that have been targeting Israel today. Now, that's notable for a couple of reasons. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=14.96s)]
*  We know that, in the past, this is something that the U.S. has done. For instance, the Biden [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=18.88s)]
*  administration had a similar posture back when this was taking place in October. But today, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=23.36s)]
*  given the events of the last 24 hours, we can report, according to my colleagues who cover the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  Pentagon, that specifically military assets in the region were moved. And I can tell you, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=34.72s)]
*  specifically, some Navy destroyers had been positioned off the Israeli coast to help [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=39.44s)]
*  shoot down some of these missiles and other aerial attacks that are expected, given what we [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=44.32s)]
*  saw last night in the initial attack. And what's notable about that, again, is that this is [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=48.88s)]
*  something where the U.S. possesses the technology that's critical in helping Israel, which, of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=53.68s)]
*  course, has its own very sophisticated modern aerial defense systems with the Iron Dome and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=59.76s)]
*  with all of the experience it has, but where it's often a case you see that the U.S. would aid [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=64.88s)]
*  Israel in its defense because of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who live in Israel, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=71.36s)]
*  and in addition to the military assets that are positioned in and around Israel, that the U.S., [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=76.88s)]
*  of course, would have an interest in defending. So that is a new development. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=82.08s)]
*  And I'm here at the White House where President Trump still hasn't added anything to his public [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=86.08s)]
*  schedule. He had a national security meeting with his top aides in the Situation Room earlier today, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=90.56s)]
*  which I'm told was fairly lengthy and ongoing as they were monitoring all of this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  I can also tell you, Christina, that the president today has spoken with Israeli Prime Minister [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=100.16s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. We know that they had spoken earlier in the week as well. But as we are trying [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=105.2s)]
*  to navigate all these questions of what the U.S. knew in advance of Israel's attack on Iran [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=110.0s)]
*  yesterday and what role it has played today and what role it will continue to play, that's a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=115.04s)]
*  pretty key conversation. And it sounds like there are other world leader calls that have taken place [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=119.6s)]
*  with Downing Street saying that the president spoke with the British prime minister and there [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=123.92s)]
*  are reports of other calls. So we'll bring you more details as we have it, but significant again [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=128.32s)]
*  to update our viewers that U.S. officials do tell us that the U.S. is playing a role in helping [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=133.12s)]
*  Israel defend itself against these retaliatory attacks from Iran. Christina? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=138.4s)]
*  Monica, thank you so much. We also have some new reporting in from our producer in Tel Aviv. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=143.6s)]
*  The IDF spokesperson says both barrages of missiles, there were less than 100 missiles fired [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=148.4s)]
*  at Tel Aviv from Iran. I want to go now to Susan Glasser. She's a staff writer at The New Yorker, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=154.72s)]
*  but Susan, you have a lot of foreign policy experience and knowledge. We just heard Monica [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=159.84s)]
*  talking about the fact that the president has spoken with Bibi Netanyahu. We also saw a statement [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=164.88s)]
*  that he has spoken to the Saudi crown prince. How does the U.S. being involved in defending Israel [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  from this attack from Iran? Was that predictable and does it change at all the calculation inside [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=176.24s)]
*  the White House with where the U.S. goes from here? Yeah, I think it's notable, but it would be a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  surprise if the United States wasn't participating in the defense of Israel because that really would [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  be the policy and has been the policy of Democrats and Republicans alike in recent decades. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=193.36s)]
*  I think the surprise would have been if the U.S. wasn't deploying assets and making them [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=200.56s)]
*  available to the Israelis as they defend itself. It would be notable and I think was striking that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=205.68s)]
*  the U.S. decided not to participate in a proactive way in this preemptive Israeli strike on Iran's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=211.12s)]
*  nuclear capability. I think there's also a level of uncertainty. Here we are. We're going to be [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=218.0s)]
*  approaching soon, the 24-hour mark since Israel made this very bold and audacious attack on Iran. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=224.96s)]
*  Yet it's not entirely clear where President Trump and his administration stand, in part because [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=232.96s)]
*  they've been having a real fight inside this MAGA inner circle. The foreign policy world around Trump [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=238.32s)]
*  has been divided on the question. There are some more traditional Republican hawks, very suspicious [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=245.52s)]
*  of Iran, very suspicious of the nuclear talks that Trump personally very much wanted to engage in. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  And yet there are also many of the kind of Tucker Carlson types inside the administration and on the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=258.48s)]
*  outside who are very wary and worried that Israel will get the United States into another war in [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  the Middle East. And I thought it was very interesting that Carlson publicly kind of broke [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  with the hawks in the Trump world today. And I think you're going to see that fight continue. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=274.64s)]
*  And that's partially why we're a little bit confused and don't know exactly what the American [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  policy is right now. Yeah, Susan, those of us who've been covering foreign policy here for a long [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=285.12s)]
*  time have seen successive administrations say they want to pivot U.S. foreign policy away from the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=290.0s)]
*  Middle East. They want to focus on other places in the world. Obama, Trump, they all just keep [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  getting pulled back into this debate because of actions and things that happen on the ground. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=299.76s)]
*  Corey, before I let you go, I do want to ask you, since you were the former deputy administrator for [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=304.88s)]
*  the defense of nuclear nonproliferation and you are so intimately aware and familiar with these [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=309.76s)]
*  facilities in Iran, we have the statement from the head of the IAEA who told the U.N. Security [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=314.88s)]
*  Council just a little while ago that the above ground plant where Iran was producing uranium [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=320.08s)]
*  enriched up to 60% has been destroyed. Do you know what he's talking about and what can you [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=325.36s)]
*  tell us about that facility? Corey, do we still have you with us? I'm here. Go ahead. Go ahead. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=330.56s)]
*  Okay. Netanz is one of the two major uranium enrichment facilities in Iran and it is a [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=342.32s)]
*  combination of underground and above ground facilities. Some of the key facilities are or [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=348.0s)]
*  were actually above ground and that includes some of their research and development, some of [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=353.76s)]
*  their manufacturing and their testing facilities and a place where they could have small cascades [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=358.32s)]
*  of centrifuges to produce higher levels of enrichment. This is in addition to the major [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=363.28s)]
*  fortified underground facility at Fordow. What I really worry about is I hope that this does push [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=368.24s)]
*  Iran back to the negotiating table, but I'm afraid the lesson that they'll take away is that none of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=374.24s)]
*  their care of their bluster and none of their rhetoric was able to deter Israel from this action [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=379.04s)]
*  and maybe their only deterrence would be nuclear weapons. I really worry that these actions are [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=385.12s)]
*  driving Iran closer to making that decision to pursue nuclear weapons and rather than further [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=389.68s)]
*  away. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  you [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJjuFvZmUs&t=409.04s)]
