# ‘He spoke the truth’: John Kerry reflects on Pope Francis’ legacy of climate activism
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4)
*  Pope Francis visited the United States as pontiff only once, and when he did, he rallied [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=0.0s)]
*  Congress to join him in a fight that was one of the most consistent of his papacy, the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=5.76s)]
*  fight against climate change. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  The environmental challenge we are undergoing and its human roots concern and affect us [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=13.44s)]
*  all. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=26.44s)]
*  He met with former climate envoy and Secretary of State John Kerry at least four times. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=27.44s)]
*  The Secretary joins me now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=38.44s)]
*  Thanks so much for being here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=40.24s)]
*  And I want to talk obviously about climate, but I know you had a chance to go into the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=41.68s)]
*  Basilica in many ways. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=46.08s)]
*  I think the two of you certainly on climate were kindred spirits. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=47.64s)]
*  What was the feeling as you walked by him? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=51.84s)]
*  For many reasons, well beyond climate, I had a feeling of having lost not just the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=56.4s)]
*  Pope but a friend, somebody who was incredibly generous with his time, with his concern, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=62.4s)]
*  with his commitment and passion of his engagement. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=68.2s)]
*  And it's enormously sad to transition away from the degree to which he was obviously [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  committed to it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=80.44s)]
*  A lot of other pieces though of his papacy that draw, I think, and hope, and you can [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=81.6s)]
*  see it from the swelling response all around the world, people are affected by his humility, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=87.08s)]
*  by his down to earth presence, by his passion for poor and for the disadvantaged. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=94.48s)]
*  And he lived every part of his life was obviously dedicated to being true to his own beliefs [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=103.32s)]
*  and his own word. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=111.24s)]
*  He boldly stood up in front of Congress despite the fact there was some denialists there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  He spoke the truth. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=118.96s)]
*  And the climate crisis presents us ironically with one of the great economic opportunities [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  of all time. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=125.44s)]
*  And I think that, you know, the Holy Father knew that there were jobs there, but also [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=128.12s)]
*  the people who get most affected by the downside of what's happening are the poor people and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=134.88s)]
*  the people who have nowhere to go and who see their property destroyed and their chance [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=140.4s)]
*  to have cultivation, you know, grow food and so forth, disappearing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=144.88s)]
*  There are already about 40 million, you know, moving refugees around the world because of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=150.12s)]
*  climate. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=156.68s)]
*  And there will be more unless we can move faster to respond to it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=157.68s)]
*  And finally, the Pope understood, and I heard him say it, that this challenge of dealing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=161.72s)]
*  with the climate crisis is not all crisis, it's opportunity. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=169.0s)]
*  And it is a way of making countries more secure, healthier, safer. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=173.2s)]
*  That transition is something we shouldn't fear, it's something we should embrace. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=178.84s)]
*  And other countries all around the world are embracing it, including China, and moving [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=182.72s)]
*  much more rapidly to develop and deploy the tools to be able to solve this problem. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=187.88s)]
*  He made a very bold statement very early on, which was to make his first encyclical about [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  climate change. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=199.4s)]
*  But he did not mince words. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  And recently, one of the things that he said blunt was this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  He said humanity was turning the glorious creation of Earth into a wasteland full of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  debris, desolation, and filth. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  What was it about this in your personal conversations? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=218.2s)]
*  And I know you had long conversations about this that drove him. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  And do you think it had an impact? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=225.76s)]
*  Well, I know it had an impact. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=227.24s)]
*  Because Laudato Si was quoted by people all around the world. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  The encyclical, his first encyclical, very important one, was about the crisis. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=233.08s)]
*  That makes its own statement that it was the first and it was powerful. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=239.72s)]
*  But he came back right before the meeting in Dubai two years ago and put out a coda [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=244.0s)]
*  to Laudato Si called Laudat Deum. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=251.28s)]
*  And that reminded us of the road not traveled in the years since Laudato Si. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=254.76s)]
*  Did he ever express frustration when you talked about it? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=262.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=265.4s)]
*  I mean, he would roll his eyes a little bit about the human challenge of getting people [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=266.4s)]
*  to do things. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=271.96s)]
*  But he had faith in that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=273.84s)]
*  Obviously, he had faith. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=274.84s)]
*  He was remarkable in his steady, calm, quiet, but totally dedicated mission of dealing with [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=275.84s)]
*  this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=286.08s)]
*  And largely driven, I might add, not just by the facts of what are happening in countries [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=287.08s)]
*  where every year a massive amount of fires now, much more intense storms, much more damage, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=291.76s)]
*  interruption of commerce, supply chains get interrupted, but also military readiness gets [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=300.12s)]
*  interrupted. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=305.6s)]
*  There are other major impacts. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=306.6s)]
*  And he felt that people should understand this not just in humanitarian terms, but on [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=309.64000000000004s)]
*  self-interest of security of their nation, of their businesses, of their families. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  So his concern was sort of spread across this panoply of realities that the climate crisis [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=324.48s)]
*  presents us with. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=333.84s)]
*  It's really interesting, too, that this man of faith who is here to speak about the faith [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=338.6s)]
*  of the church and some of the beliefs which are obviously based on faith, not evidence. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  But in the case of the climate crisis, it's all based on evidence. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  It's not a matter of faith what is happening. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=355.68s)]
*  It's a matter of mathematics and physics and biology and chemistry. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=357.88s)]
*  And he knew that, and he accepted that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=362.12s)]
*  So he isn't living in some alternative world where he doesn't understand the components. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=364.56s)]
*  He's a scientist, too, in a way. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  And so I really think that it should cause all of us to stop and think about the useful, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=374.44s)]
*  simple, constructive ways in which we can all of us come together and be better off [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=381.48s)]
*  for it, have more jobs, have better jobs in a sense, hopefully down the road, and live [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=387.12s)]
*  a better life because we're reducing the poison that is actually killing people today. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=394.4s)]
*  And he was referring always to the killing of life itself on the planet in terms of all [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=400.04s)]
*  of the life that exists in the creation of the universe. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=408.32s)]
*  And creation care, that's what he talked about. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=412.48s)]
*  Creation care. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=416.32s)]
*  And that's what's in Laudato Si, that's within Laudato Dem. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  And I urge people, you may not be, you have to be Catholic and you certainly don't have [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=420.52000000000004s)]
*  to yet be a believer about climate, but his encyclicals are really informative and very [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  moving and powerful. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=430.84s)]
*  He was a powerful voice for peace. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=432.64s)]
*  He talked about the war in Ukraine. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=434.88s)]
*  He talked about the war in Gaza. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  You were Secretary of State when Russia annexed Crimea. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=438.64s)]
*  And I want to ask you... [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=441.84s)]
*  But when they stated they were... [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=442.84s)]
*  They stated, yeah. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  We did not allow them to annex it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=445.15999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=446.68s)]
*  And we stood up against it and called it against international law. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=447.68s)]
*  Yeah, they said it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=450.32s)]
*  But that doesn't... [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=451.32s)]
*  Can I ask you about... [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=452.32s)]
*  I mean, it's a law that does not make it theirs. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=453.32s)]
*  Can I ask you what President Trump said yesterday, that under the peace deal he is pursuing, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=455.12s)]
*  Crimea will stay with Russia? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=459.68s)]
*  Well, who knows? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=461.76s)]
*  I mean, I personally don't agree with putting that out on the table. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=463.4s)]
*  It's a dramatic change in U.S. policy. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=468.6s)]
*  Huge, I just said. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=474.28s)]
*  I don't necessarily agree with putting that out on the table. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=475.28s)]
*  Who knows what the parties will accept? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=478.48s)]
*  Clearly, it has to be perceived by each party as being a fair to them and as a balanced [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=481.8s)]
*  outcome somehow. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=488.44s)]
*  And I think that to announce where you're coming down as a mediator ahead of time puts [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=490.52s)]
*  everybody in a very difficult position. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=497.64s)]
*  My hope is... [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=500.08s)]
*  I mean, I applaud the president for pursuing this. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=501.08s)]
*  I know he's dogged about it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=503.44s)]
*  He wants to treat peace. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=504.96s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  And I wish them well in their efforts to try to get there. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=508.44s)]
*  It's a tough task, but it's doable. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=512.16s)]
*  And I think it's really important for the administration to continue to work at it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=514.8s)]
*  He did have influence. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=518.32s)]
*  And in fact, I should report that we just got the final numbers from the Vatican. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Fvb46QpS4&t=519.32s)]
