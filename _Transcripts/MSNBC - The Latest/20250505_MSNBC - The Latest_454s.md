# ‘The first dire signs of trouble are here’: American imports from China plunge due to Trump’s tariff
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ)
*  I'm guessing it's how Wiley Coyote felt, having vaulted over the cliff edge, suspended in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  midair, aware of what was about to happen, but unable to stop it from happening. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  This afternoon, the American economy, like our friend Mr. Coyote, is in that spot, in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=11.94s)]
*  stasis, hovering before a likely plunge. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=17.7s)]
*  How far or how fast will fall is a matter of some debate. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=20.56s)]
*  The people involved in shipping, imports and supply chain planning and economics are making [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=24.56s)]
*  themselves very loud and very clear today that the first dire signs of trouble are already [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=30.419999999999998s)]
*  here. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=35.8s)]
*  Consider the sheer drop in volume among imports this afternoon, stuff coming into our country. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=36.8s)]
*  Jean Soroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, suggesting arrivals could [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=43.0s)]
*  drop by 35% this week or next, as shipments out of China have, quote, essentially ceased. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=47.96s)]
*  Beyond the effect this will inevitably have on the price and availability of lots of things, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  there are downstream effects on the entire economy as well. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=60.96s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=64.52s)]
*  How much are you going to see a real decline in dock workers if this goes on? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=65.52s)]
*  Yeah, this is the question. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=71.4s)]
*  So the trucker hauling four or five containers today. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=72.44s)]
*  She probably hauls two or three. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=75.72s)]
*  The dock workers are no longer going to see overtime and double shifts. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  They're going to probably work less than a traditional work week, starting right off [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=81.48s)]
*  the bat. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=85.16s)]
*  Every four containers need a job. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  So when we start dialing this back, it's less job opportunities. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=88.2s)]
*  And what happens if we get a deal? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=91.68s)]
*  If we get a deal, it's going to take about a month. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  Let me walk you through that real quick. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=95.68s)]
*  About two weeks to get the ships repositioned around these major ports, from Qingdao to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=97.56s)]
*  Shanghai to Xiamen, load up all those containers and then another two weeks to steam across [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=102.4s)]
*  the Pacific to get to us. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  This is important because now we're talking about spring and summer fashion. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=109.68s)]
*  So we're kind of at a crux here that we've got to have something pretty quick. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  This is where we are. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=118.28s)]
*  And as the American people prepare for that scenario, best case scenario, if we have a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=119.28s)]
*  deal right now is a month. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=123.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's approach appears to be, what are you complaining about? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=126.12s)]
*  No big deal. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=129.6s)]
*  He said so much in an interview with our colleague Kristen Walker on Meet the Press, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=130.72s)]
*  where Trump dismissed a number of concerns. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=135.52s)]
*  Some prices are going up. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=139.76s)]
*  Tires, strollers, some clothing in the wake of your tariffs. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=141.28s)]
*  That's peanuts compared to energy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=145.56s)]
*  Energy is 60 percent of the cost. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=148.3s)]
*  But sir, you campaigned on a promise to bring prices down on day one. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=150.92s)]
*  Well I don't know when you say strollers are going up. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=155.68s)]
*  What kind of a thing? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=158.6s)]
*  I'm saying that gasoline is going down. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=159.68s)]
*  Gasoline is thousands of times more important than a stroller someplace. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  But what do you say to Americans who say they voted for you because they want and they need [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  relief right now? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=170.34s)]
*  And they're getting it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=171.72s)]
*  Right now? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=173.0s)]
*  What about those different items I just mentioned? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=174.0s)]
*  Mortgage rates are going down despite the fact that we have a stubborn Fed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  You said dolls, even dolls could cost a couple bucks more. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=180.0s)]
*  Maybe they might, but you don't need to have, as I said, 35 dolls. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=182.68s)]
*  You can have two, three, four and save a lot of money. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=186.9s)]
*  We don't need to feed the beast. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  I guess you're talking about this transition cost. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=192.18s)]
*  How long should people expect that transition to last, Mr. President? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=194.98000000000002s)]
*  I can't tell you that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=199.1s)]
*  I can tell you that we're making a lot of money. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=200.18s)]
*  We're doing great. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=203.02s)]
*  Donald Trump's war on toddlers, especially those who want dolls and strollers, continues. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=204.02s)]
*  It's where we start today. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=210.22s)]
*  Joining us now is the CEO of the Port of Long Beach, Mario Cordero. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=211.66s)]
*  Also joining us, former Democratic Senator, MSNBC political analyst Claire McCaskill. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  And with me at the table, New York Times editorial board member, MSNBC political analyst, Marge. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=221.2s)]
*  Mario, if you could just take me through. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=226.64s)]
*  I'm from California. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  I was born in Newport Beach. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm familiar with Long Beach and how central to the whole country's economy your business [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  is. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=237.92s)]
*  But just tell the story of what happens there and why it matters. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=238.92s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=242.68s)]
*  So, as you are aware, this is the largest container gateway in the United States. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=244.44s)]
*  So whatever happens here is going to be a reflection on what happens to the country. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=249.72s)]
*  So what is happening now, after Long Beach being the number one port and containerized [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=254.26s)]
*  cargo for the first quarter of 2025, we are looking to a 35 or even a 40 percent reduction. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=258.5s)]
*  And let me give you a number to support that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=265.8s)]
*  This week, ordinarily, we would have expected 17 vessel calls. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=268.64s)]
*  Right now, the number looks like three. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  So it's more than a 50 percent reduction. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=275.1s)]
*  So we've seen the impact. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=277.58s)]
*  We've seen the impact on Wall Street the last several weeks. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=279.06s)]
*  Now we're going to start seeing the impact on Main Street. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=282.14s)]
*  Will you be able to sort of have top of mind the sorts of numbers that Gene had, that truckers, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=285.5s)]
*  dock workers, every four containers is a job? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=293.26s)]
*  Are those numbers the same for you? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=297.38s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=301.08s)]
*  Less container volumes, less jobs for the dock workers, less truckers and overall in [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=302.12s)]
*  the logistics supply chain. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=307.32s)]
*  And let me ask you the same question that he fielded there. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=309.32s)]
*  If a deal were had this week, just talk about how quickly that means the economy would bounce [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  back in terms of bringing things here, unloading them and putting them back onto store shelves [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=320.24s)]
*  for Americans. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, we are in this globalized supply chain. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=327.47999999999996s)]
*  So it's going to take a few weeks to bounce back. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=330.44s)]
*  I mean, the good news is there appears to be a consultatory tones both with regard to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=333.04s)]
*  Washington and Beijing. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=336.88s)]
*  So for now, we are now seeing that imports are being held in China. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=339.52s)]
*  Bookings are about almost a 50 percent reduction. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=344.96s)]
*  So if you're an importer, you're not going to send your goods to the United States until [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=347.76s)]
*  you have some clarity and clarity on the tariffs. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=351.96s)]
*  Because right now, if you're shipping goods from China, you're subject to a 145 percent [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=355.42s)]
*  tax. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=359.62s)]
*  Now, we start seeing as of May 2nd, Friday, that if you ordered to an e-commerce company [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=360.62s)]
*  in China a pair of tennis shoes for about $175, the de minimis rule is no longer applicable. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=366.3s)]
*  So that shoe now has gone up from $175 to approximately $350. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=373.42s)]
*  That gives you the magnitude of the price increase that we're talking about. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=378.66s)]
*  Let me just throw some more numbers out to you while we have you. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=383.7s)]
*  So there were 34 canceled sailings from Ocean Carriers to Long Beach with another 36 cancellations [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=387.5s)]
*  heading into the Port of Los Angeles. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=395.06s)]
*  Do these numbers, we have it here that they already exceed the supply chain crisis that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=397.62s)]
*  you experienced during COVID? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=403.02s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=404.98s)]
*  Between the two ports at this complex, we've had 70 canceled sailings, and that number [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=405.98s)]
*  exceeds the worst scenario in the COVID crisis. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=411.18s)]
*  Do your goods make their way, you know, how far across the country? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=415.46s)]
*  I mean, how many consumers are impacted by that drop off? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=419.41999999999996s)]
*  The goods that come to the Port of Long Beach, every congressional district in the mainland [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=424.09999999999997s)]
*  receives some sort of goods and cargo from the Port of Long Beach, all the way east to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=428.46s)]
*  Atlanta. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ay77fNTRDQ&t=433.46s)]
