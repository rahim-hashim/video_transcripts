Video Description: Private incarceration companies are playing a huge role in Trump’s deportation plans. The biggest detention centers in the country are run by private companies – many of which have tried to curry favor with the Trump Administration by donating to Republican campaigns or Trump’s inaugural committee. NYU Law Professor Rachel Barkow says the dynamics mimic the larger prison industrial complex. Co-creator, Migration and Technology Monitor Petra Molnar says some tracking apps developed by these companies can be efficient, “But right now, what technology is doing is actually replicating racism, discrimination, carceral logic.”

# ‘Billion dollar border industrial complex’ blossoms under Trump’s deportation program
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q)
*  Donald Trump's immigration crackdown has been challenged in courts and it's been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=0.0s)]
*  called inhumane by Democrats and immigration advocates but here's another [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=3.96s)]
*  word for it lucrative. Many of the largest immigration and customs enforcement [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=7.92s)]
*  processing and detention centers are privately owned and operated by [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=11.88s)]
*  companies which have donated money to Republican campaigns and Trump's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=15.68s)]
*  inauguration. Privately run prisons, detention centers and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=19.16s)]
*  tracking systems are big business in the United States with financial analysts [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=23.32s)]
*  projecting nine billion dollars in revenue across the industry this year. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=26.92s)]
*  Two of the biggest for-profit incarceration companies are CoreCivic [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=32.64s)]
*  and GeoGroup which we've talked about before. GeoGroup runs detention centers [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=36.96s)]
*  but it also produces ankle monitors and tracking apps for migrants who might [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=41.6s)]
*  otherwise be detained. On the face of it having someone wear an ankle bracelet [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=45.6s)]
*  for a nonviolent matter is better and cheaper than detaining them but federal [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=49.8s)]
*  agents are now using those non detention tools to track and detain and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=53.4s)]
*  ultimately deport people. Both companies have federal government contracts. ICE [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=57.72s)]
*  makes up 21% of CoreCivic's revenues and 43% of GeoGroup's revenues [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=62.12s)]
*  according to the Wall Street Journal and GeoGroup has embraced Washington's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=66.8s)]
*  revolving door of hiring former and future border security and immigration [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=70.44s)]
*  officials to help it win government contracts. In a new ethics filing obtained [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=73.84s)]
*  by the Washington Post the Trump administration border czar Tom Homan who [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=78.2s)]
*  was deputy director of ICE in Trump's first term disclosed that he received [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=81.88s)]
*  more than five thousand dollars in consulting fees from the GeoGroup in the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=86.28s)]
*  two years before he was appointed to his current role. May not sound like much but [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  the disclosure didn't actually require a more specific number. Over five thousand [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  dollars is is the number. GeoGroup's political arm donated five hundred [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=99.64s)]
*  thousand dollars to Trump's inauguration. Geo's head of client relations was the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=104.52s)]
*  acting director of ICE during Trump's first term. The Washington Post counts at [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=108.7s)]
*  least three geo executives who have worked for ICE previously. So when [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=112.58s)]
*  President Trump's border czar says the government needs space for a hundred [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=116.34s)]
*  thousand people in deportation centers across the country to accommodate [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  detained migrants he's not just talking about policy priorities he's signaling [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=123.42s)]
*  business opportunities for America's for-profit incarceration companies. As of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=127.9s)]
*  May 17th the latest data we have ICE estimated that it was detaining some [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=132.62s)]
*  50,000 migrants. More recently White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=136.82s)]
*  Miller told ICE to boost arrests by nearly 3,000 migrants a day. Most of the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=141.29999999999998s)]
*  additional space for new detainees will be supplied by companies like GeoGroup [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=146.66s)]
*  and CoreCivic. No wonder the chief executive at CoreCivic told investors in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=150.98s)]
*  a call in February quote this is truly one of the most exciting periods in my [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=155.46s)]
*  career end quote. That's something. One of the darkest periods in American history [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=159.46s)]
*  is one of the most exciting for that CEO. The latest Republican budget proposal [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=165.5s)]
*  earmarks 46 billion dollars for ICE detention centers. Already some deals have [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=170.86s)]
*  been struck. GeoGroup is reopening idle facilities in New Jersey and Michigan in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=176.74s)]
*  deals that will net the company a hundred and thirty million dollars in [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=180.82s)]
*  their first full year of operation. The New Jersey facility received a 15-year [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=184.02s)]
*  contract the GeoGroup valued at a billion dollars. But it's not just the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=188.5s)]
*  facilities that create money making opportunities it's everything in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=193.02s)]
*  between. When ICE arrested the Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil in [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=195.74s)]
*  New York he was transported to an ICE processing center in Louisiana owned by [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=200.02s)]
*  GeoGroup. Moving him required a seat on the plane and then a bus. It required a [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=205.18s)]
*  bed for him to sleep in and food for him to eat. All of these are tabs picked up [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=210.18s)]
*  by you the American taxpayer. We're not only detaining people without due [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=213.66000000000003s)]
*  process we're paying a lot of money to do so. This is where the politics and the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=217.74s)]
*  injustice and the money all intersect. Mass deportation was a Trump campaign [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=222.34s)]
*  promise. Cracking down on student protesters has been explicit policy and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=226.58s)]
*  enriching friends of the Trump administration that's apparently part of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=231.3s)]
*  the deal too. Hi joining me now two experts on the legalities of immigration [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=235.7s)]
*  and detention Petra Molnar is the co-creator of the migration and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=239.7s)]
*  technology monitor which examines the use of surveillance technologies and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  automation to screen and track people crossing borders. She's also the author of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=246.5s)]
*  the book The Walls Have Eyes Surviving Migration in the Age of Artificial [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=250.62s)]
*  Intelligence. Rachel Barco is a professor at the NYU School of Law she once served [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  as a member of the US Sentencing Commission she's also the author of the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=258.9s)]
*  book Justice Abandoned how the Supreme Court ignored the Constitution and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=262.34s)]
*  enabled mass incarceration. Thank you to both of you for being here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=265.94s)]
*  Petra let me start with you there are technologies that are used that are [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=270.3s)]
*  being used right now by the government with these companies the technologies [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=275.65999999999997s)]
*  themselves are not inherently flawed or bad and they might actually have some [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=279.74s)]
*  positive uses. I maintain that putting ankle bracelets on people is is [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=282.74s)]
*  generally better than sticking them in a cell but but these companies are [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  profiting off of what they know this administration wants they are actually [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=290.18s)]
*  coming up with things that are that are bad for policy because it's making them [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=294.18s)]
*  rich. Absolutely Ali I think you you really hit the mark there this is about [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=297.86s)]
*  profit and the fact that we're now talking about a multi billion dollar [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=303.86s)]
*  border industrial complex where private companies are the ones who are setting [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=307.7s)]
*  the stage and making determinations about what we innovate on and why and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=311.82s)]
*  it's also about framing right if we frame migration as a problem to solve [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=316.34s)]
*  then we have technological solutions that we can lean on and that's how we [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=320.82s)]
*  end up with this system that is ultimately profiting off of people's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=324.38s)]
*  misery. Yeah one day when we don't have migration we'll realize what a problem to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=327.94s)]
*  solve is. Rachel let's let's talk about this border industrial complex you you've [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=332.06s)]
*  studied incarceration we have a very high incarceration rate rate per capita [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=337.5s)]
*  in the United States countries that exceed us our countries that wouldn't [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=341.34s)]
*  surprise you Iran and China and places like that. We've lost the plot on [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=344.5s)]
*  incarceration in the in the in the direction we want to go on we've [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=348.9s)]
*  incentivized it so incarceration and the technologies that flow from it are now [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=352.82s)]
*  we're not solving a problem an underlying problem here. No and you have [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=357.5s)]
*  actors that make money off something they become entrenched lobbyists you [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=361.82s)]
*  know they are they're giving big money in the case of immigration detention and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=365.5s)]
*  almost all goes to Republicans you know about 89% of their donations go to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=369.22s)]
*  Republicans because they know if they're in office they're gonna build up the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=373.22s)]
*  immigration complex so that they'll make money off it and that's what we've seen [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=377.7s)]
*  when it comes to incarceration too you know they know that you have longer [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=381.02s)]
*  sentences you build more prisons there's money to be made and a lot of the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=385.26s)]
*  companies are the same you know so Civic Corps was a private prison company as [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=389.22s)]
*  well and you know they move back and forth where they think there's money to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=393.1s)]
*  be had. Petra is there a world in which you see technology being used in a world that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=396.3s)]
*  doesn't demonize migration or that isn't doing what we're doing right now in [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=403.70000000000005s)]
*  other words is the technology the problem or is is the policy direction [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=408.98s)]
*  the problem or is the opportunity at the moment the problem? Well ultimately [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=412.70000000000005s)]
*  technology is a tool and it's a tool that replicates power differentials in [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=418.46000000000004s)]
*  society and unfortunately right now the way our world is is incredibly weighted [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=422.74s)]
*  against marginalized communities especially people on the move and people [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=427.22s)]
*  who might be facing immigration detention and so sure perhaps there is a [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=430.62s)]
*  world where technologies can actually be thought of as being assistive or [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=434.18s)]
*  empowering or somehow being used to to write this kind of power imbalance but [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=438.66s)]
*  right now what technology is doing is actually replicating racism [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=443.94s)]
*  discrimination carceral logics like we're talking about today and again they [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=448.22s)]
*  are becoming tools of oppression not only in in the kind of context that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=452.58s)]
*  we're discussing together but but also across society and again I think it's [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=456.5s)]
*  important to always remember that that technology is not neutral it's [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=461.09999999999997s)]
*  ultimately about power. Rachel I remember covering a story about how I think was [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=464.09999999999997s)]
*  Pennsylvania where judges were getting payoffs to sentence people because [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=468.97999999999996s)]
*  because these private prisons don't want empty cells and they want more people [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=473.06s)]
*  is there a similar analogy to be used with respect to these [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=476.94s)]
*  companies tracking or helping with the immigrant detention system is there a [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=481.94s)]
*  sense that we're going to have more of it because because it's so profitable [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=485.94s)]
*  and these companies will encourage these types of policies they'll support [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=490.06s)]
*  candidates who want these kinds of policies. Yeah that's exactly the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=492.92s)]
*  dynamic they basically know the candidates that if they back and those [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=496.3s)]
*  people get into office those people will push for mass detention in the same way [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=499.98s)]
*  that they've known these are the candidates if we back they push for [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=504.65999999999997s)]

*  lobbying machine and they know what they're doing and they make tons of [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=512.14s)]
*  contributions and they get their money's worth. Petra let me ask you about about [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=515.3s)]
*  data collection something you and I talked about a little bit last time the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=520.54s)]
*  New York Times was reporting that in March President Trump signed an [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=524.02s)]
*  executive order calling for the federal government to share data across agencies [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=527.14s)]
*  raising questions over whether he might compile a master list of personal [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=530.62s)]
*  information on Americans that could give him untold surveillance power. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=534.34s)]
*  Behind the scenes officials have quietly put technological building blocks into [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=537.7s)]
*  place to enable his plan in particular they've turned to one company Palantir [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=541.1800000000001s)]
*  the data analysis and technology firm. I don't know that most Americans think [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=545.34s)]
*  they interact with Palantir on a daily basis I think I'm gonna just give you a [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=549.34s)]
*  rough guess here all Americans interact with Palantir on a daily basis. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=553.0600000000001s)]
*  Absolutely Palantir is one of the leading actors in this conversation a [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=557.9s)]
*  company that has been setting the stage again on what we innovate on and why and [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=563.06s)]
*  they have become a welcome partner to the current Trump administration [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=566.8199999999999s)]
*  although they had contracts with with the government before as well and other [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=571.26s)]
*  government and so paying attention to what these companies are doing is super [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=574.4599999999999s)]
*  important because they are the ones that are setting up the data [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=578.98s)]
*  infrastructure that actually powers the surveillance machine that is being [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=582.26s)]
*  rolled out and so the data politics and the collection and storing and sharing [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=586.6999999999999s)]
*  of sensitive data is something that we all need to be aware of not just people [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=591.26s)]
*  on the move but but every citizen. Yeah and this is this is part of the issue I [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=594.66s)]
*  think Petra makes a good point these companies were all doing business with [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=599.3000000000001s)]
*  with administrations going back many years they've just evolved into the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=603.66s)]
*  center of the discussion. Yeah and under the Biden administration for example you [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=607.26s)]
*  might remember there was talk where he said no more private prisons but [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=610.78s)]
*  immigration detention facilities were exempted from that and so all these [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=614.5s)]
*  companies were operating and also profiting under the Biden administration. Yeah I think it's [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=618.22s)]
*  important people to remember that these are not distinct things immigration [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=622.1800000000001s)]
*  detention centers are still essentially private prisons. Yes. That's it's [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pQ1rf007Q&t=626.62s)]
