# Politicians 'putting us all in jeopardy' by staying in office too long: Dem strategist
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY)
*  The generational change movement in the Democratic Party just launched its most pointed challenge yet. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=0.0s)]
*  A 35-year-old firefighter and former Jeopardy! contestant, Harry Jarin, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=6.5s)]
*  says he will run for the seat currently held by 85-year-old Steny Hoyer, so 50 years older, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=11.3s)]
*  and who would be 89 at the end of his next term. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=17.5s)]
*  Here's the bottom line. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=22.0s)]
*  You don't put out a fire by sending in the same people who let it spread. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=23.5s)]
*  You send in a firefighter. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=27.5s)]
*  So I'll ask you again. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=29.0s)]
*  Do you really think that Steny Hoyer at 89 years old is the best person to represent us? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=30.5s)]
*  Maryland deserves a new generation of leadership, and I'm ready to take up the fight. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=36.5s)]
*  That statement is essentially the mantra for young Democrats who believe the party is in trouble [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=42.0s)]
*  because the old guard keeps making the same bad decisions. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=47.0s)]
*  And so they argue, it's time for new blood. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=50.5s)]
*  Kevin Madden back with us, and joining me in studio, Julie Roginsky, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=53.5s)]
*  a Democratic strategist and author of the salty politics newsletter on substacks. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=57.0s)]
*  So, Julie, Harry Jarin points out in his website, campaign website, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=61.5s)]
*  that he was born during Steny Hoyer's fifth term in Congress. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=67.0s)]
*  Hoyer hasn't said if he's running again, and members of Congress have served into their 90s, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=71.0s)]
*  but could this challenge push Steny Hoyer a little bit toward retirement, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=76.5s)]
*  maybe push people to suggest he might want to think about retirement? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=82.0s)]
*  You know, I don't know that Steny Hoyer wants to retire because I look at Jim Clyburn, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=85.5s)]
*  who was in leadership with Steny Hoyer for a long time, who said, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=90.5s)]
*  what do you want me to do? Give up my life if I don't run for Congress? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=93.0s)]
*  Well, we're not here to make Jim Clyburn's life easier. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=96.5s)]
*  We're here to make sure that we have a full complement of Democratic Congress people and senators [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=99.5s)]
*  who can vote against the Republicans' bad policy ideas. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=104.5s)]
*  And I'll give you an example. Since the start of this year, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=107.0s)]
*  three Democratic members of Congress have died. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=109.0s)]
*  And this horrible bill that Donald Trump and the Republicans just passed, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=112.0s)]
*  this budget bill passed by one vote, had they been alive, this bill would not have passed. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=115.5s)]
*  And I say that to say that we have to have a serious reckoning as Democrats [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=120.5s)]
*  about the fact that this is not a retirement community. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=124.5s)]
*  We need to make sure that we have young, healthy people who are able to serve. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=128.0s)]
*  And time comes for all of us. It's going to come for me. It's going to come for you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=131.5s)]
*  Hopefully many, many, many decades down the road. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=134.5s)]
*  But these people are many decades down the road. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=136.5s)]
*  And we need to make sure that they understand that it's not just their careers that they're harming [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=138.5s)]
*  by sticking around too long. They're putting the lives of all of us and our future in jeopardy [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=143.0s)]
*  if something happens to them and they're not able to vote for or against legislation that's good for the country. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=148.5s)]
*  So, Kevin, as you know, one of the most prominent Democrats calling for this generational change [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=153.0s)]
*  is the DNC vice chair, David Hogg. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=157.0s)]
*  These are photos of the candidates, his leaders, we deserve organizations supported in the last election, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=159.5s)]
*  lots of young blood, but only four of the 12 won their races. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=165.5s)]
*  Can youth work against you? I mean, you're a comms guy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=169.5s)]
*  How do you frame the fight, depending on what side you're on, of age, youth, fresh blood versus experience? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=173.5s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, I think I largely agree with what Julie has laid out. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=182.5s)]
*  You know, this is, anytime you have a youth movement like this or especially when you have political parties, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=186.5s)]
*  which are essentially organizations around ideas, organizations around issues, having new, fresh blood, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=192.5s)]
*  pushing on ideas and pushing on issues is ultimately a good thing. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=199.5s)]
*  I think the hard part for the David Hoggs of the world and other young leaders inside the party is that, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=203.5s)]
*  look, Steny Hoyer is there for 40 years for a reason. He knows every single inch of that district that he represents. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=209.5s)]
*  He's spent the time working at VFW halls, you know, all the party picnics that take place. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=216.5s)]
*  And as a result, he has a very strong base of support in the district. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=222.5s)]
*  And it's not just about what you read or hear or what you're fighting about on social media. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=226.5s)]
*  And I think that was one of the criticisms that you've seen this candidate lob against the party, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=232.5s)]
*  which is that, you know, they're not in touch with the young base. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=238.5s)]
*  They're not in touch with the social media communications tools. It's a lot more than that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=241.5s)]
*  So if they're going to be successful, they're going to have to get really good at the grassroots [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=247.5s)]
*  and the organizing as well as how they communicate inside the party. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=250.5s)]
*  We should say, Julie, that David Hogg isn't exactly reinventing the wheel. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=254.5s)]
*  I mean, I go back to 2017 when an organization called Run for Something really pushed young progressives. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=257.5s)]
*  They've had a pretty good success record. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=263.5s)]
*  Their argument at the beginning when I interviewed the founder was that we need to have a pipeline, right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=267.5s)]
*  We need to start people maybe at the local level, at the county level. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=274.5s)]
*  And then they go to Congress and then they go to Senate and maybe we will have a future president. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=278.5s)]
*  You work your way up. Have Democrats figured out the way to use? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=284.5s)]
*  Because they're not the only ones either. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=289.5s)]
*  I think it's just these disparate organizations are what seem disparate but have in many ways the same goal. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=291.5s)]
*  Look, and Kevin can speak to this as a Republican, but I can tell you as a former Republican, maybe, Kevin, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=297.5s)]
*  I don't know where you are these days. But GOPAC was a brilliant and continues to be a brilliant pipeline organization [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=302.5s)]
*  for the Republicans that has been around since the 70s. They have developed an incredible pipeline. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=309.5s)]
*  Michael Steele was the former chairman of it. He could really speak to this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=313.5s)]
*  But the reality is Democrats have not done anything like this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=316.5s)]
*  And there's this very famous phrase that Democrats fall in love and Republicans fall in line. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=319.5s)]
*  Well, Democrats are always looking for some leader to come along and be the president and to lead them out of the wilderness. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=323.5s)]
*  We can't have that. We need to build an entire pipeline, whether it is a pipeline for the courts [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=329.5s)]
*  like the Federalist Society has on the Republican side and the conservative side, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=334.5s)]
*  whether it's GOPAC as Republicans have for the state legislature that eventually these people work their way up to Congress [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=337.5s)]
*  and eventually maybe even further to the Senate and maybe the presidency. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=343.5s)]
*  Democrats don't have that right now. And it's a huge miss. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=347.5s)]
*  And I would say that if you are a Democrat who is worth billions and billions of dollars [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=350.5s)]
*  and you're thinking about how to reinvent the wheel here for the party, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=354.5s)]
*  the best way to do that is start these kinds of organizations that really find local young talent and nurture them and develop them. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=357.5s)]
*  And again, it's not reinventing the wheel. The Republicans have done this incredibly effectively. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=364.5s)]
*  We need to take a lesson from that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=368.5s)]
*  Well, Kevin, she brings up a very good point, and that is money. That is fundraising, right? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=369.5s)]
*  You're a 20-something. You may be smart. You may be committed. You may do the hard work that David Hogg does, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=373.5s)]
*  although he had a platform based on a terribly unfortunate situation, to say the least. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=378.5s)]
*  But you need to have money. It's very hard to find a race, a competitive race, recently, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=384.5s)]
*  where they're not spending more money than has ever been spent in that district or that state in history, right? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=391.5s)]
*  And you probably don't have the contacts for fundraising when you're 25 or 26 as someone older has. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=397.5s)]
*  So it does become a part of either a billionaire or somebody with deep pockets or the party, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=404.5s)]
*  which gets to decide which races they support. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=411.5s)]
*  Talk about the money issue and the challenge that presents for promising young leaders. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=413.5s)]
*  Well, I think money is only one part of it. When I worked on campaigns, we used to talk about resources. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=419.5s)]
*  Resources meant time, money, effort, people. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=424.5s)]
*  So I think looking more holistically is of a huge advantage any time you're trying to build and manage [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=428.5s)]
*  and be successful with a political movement. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=435.5s)]
*  And to Julie's point, you know, I think they will—I'll start to believe that these young leaders inside the party [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=437.5s)]
*  have a better chance when they start mapping out what their plan is, not for the next midterm election, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=442.5s)]
*  but what's their plan to build, grow and manage their movement over the next 10 years. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=448.5s)]
*  And that is where money is part of the bigger, broader infrastructure of time, effort, resources, you name it. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=452.5s)]
*  Because if it's just about writing checks, you're right. It's only going to be the big donors. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=458.5s)]
*  But when it's that bigger argument and it's a 10-year plan, that's where it has much greater impact. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=462.5s)]
*  Kevin Madden, Julie Roginsky, not the last time we'll have this conversation. It's an important one. Thank you both. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=468.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvci__BOwY&t=482.5s)]
