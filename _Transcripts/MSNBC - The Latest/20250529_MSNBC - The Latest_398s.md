Video Description: NBC’s Ryan Reilly joins Way Too Early to break down Donald Trump’s latest round of controversial pardons, including a former gang leader, a reality TV couple, and potential consideration for the men convicted in the plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. As Reilly notes, the key to Trump’s clemency decisions is often “access” and “making the case that you were a victim of government overreach.” Trump’s pardon attorney wrote online: “No MAGA left behind.”

**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE)
*  President Trump continues to issue a series of controversial pardons and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=0.0s)]
*  commutations. The list includes a former New York congressman who pleaded guilty [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=4.2s)]
*  to felony tax evasion, a former Connecticut governor found guilty of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=7.88s)]
*  obstructing justice, a rapper known as NBA Youngboy who pleaded guilty to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=11.8s)]
*  possessing weapons as a felon, as a felon, and more. On the list of pardons were [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=16.16s)]
*  the men convicted in a scheme to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer but [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=20.64s)]
*  Trump says he's looking into their case. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  I'm gonna look at it. I will take a look at it. It's been brought to my attention. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=27.64s)]
*  I did watch the trial. It looked to me like somewhat of a railroad job. I'll be [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=32.32s)]
*  honest with you. It looked to me like some people said some stupid things, you [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=37.32s)]
*  know. They were drinking and I think they said stupid things but I'll take a look [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  at that and a lot of people are asking me that question from both sides actually. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  A lot of people think they got railroaded. A lot of people think they got [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=48.96s)]
*  railroaded. Remember that situation. Those men were convicted for potentially [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=53.6s)]
*  plans to kidnap a sitting governor. President Trump has also commuted the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=59.4s)]
*  sentences of former Chicago gang leader Larry Hoover. Hoover once called one of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=64.12s)]
*  the most notorious criminals in Illinois history, has been serving multiple life [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  sentences since the 1970s after he was convicted for ordering the killing of a [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=71.92s)]
*  19 year old drug dealer. Hoover has previously renounced his criminal past [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=76.12s)]
*  and has made requests to shorten his sentence including under the first step [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=80.12s)]
*  act, a criminal justice reform bill passed during Trump's first term. Trump [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=83.48s)]
*  commuted the sentences after a campaign by hip-hop artist Yeh, formerly Kanye West, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=88.12s)]
*  who's lobbied Trump in the Oval Office to consider releasing Hoover. The move is [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=92.4s)]
*  not expected to set Hoover free though as he has over a hundred years left to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  serve on state murder charges in Illinois that presidential clemency [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=101.04s)]
*  doesn't erase. Joining us now NBC News justice reporter Ryan Riley. Ryan those [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=104.92s)]
*  pardons seem to be a hodgepodge of people but what's the common thread that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=110.36s)]
*  you found on the list? I think you know getting access to Donald Trump is the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=114.76s)]
*  key point here and being able to make a case that they were you know you were [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=119.42s)]
*  either a victim of government overreach obviously Donald Trump who faced those [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=123.0s)]
*  two cases from Jack Smith as well as that's you know separate cases from from [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  state authorities I think has a lot of sympathy for individuals who alleged [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=130.76s)]
*  they were targeted. You saw that with the reality television show couple for [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=134.24s)]
*  example who could you know make the case that they or didn't make the case [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=137.28s)]
*  that they were being targeted for politics even though that case as you [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=141.52s)]
*  point out started during Donald Trump's first term in office that's when that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=145.28s)]
*  original indictment came down it was a long-standing investigation and so you [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=149.72s)]
*  know I think that that's sort of the secret sauce for getting for getting [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=154.32s)]
*  some sympathy from Donald Trump is saying that you know you're targeted for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=157.64s)]
*  your political reasons or just having that sort of inside connection and you [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=160.36s)]
*  know if you look back to who is pardoned czar is now that was you know [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=163.76s)]
*  an individual Alice Johnson who got to his attention because of in the first [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=167.84s)]
*  term because of Kimberly Kardashian Kim Kardashian right who got that case in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=172.32s)]
*  front of him after she saw a video about that case so I think that that access is [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  a really key component here and I think that there's a lot of a lot of lawyers [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=181.48s)]
*  who are basically trying to figure out how they can make their way to the White [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=185.6s)]
*  House and make their case yeah access is key loyalty is key you look at the case [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=189.02s)]
*  for example of the Chris Lee's their daughter is a Trump supporter and Trump's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=194.02s)]
*  pardon attorney yesterday pretty much said the quiet part out loud he wrote [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=198.26000000000002s)]
*  on social media quote no MAGA left behind so what do you think this suggests [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=201.82000000000002s)]
*  about how the White House is actually choosing people to pardon and who it [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=206.34s)]
*  might mean could come next yeah and Martin actually posted that about that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  case involving a sheriff who was the supporter of Donald Trump and the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=213.66000000000003s)]
*  allegations there and the conviction there was for this notion that he was [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=217.98s)]
*  basically taking bribes and handing out these these badges and making people [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=222.17999999999998s)]
*  auxiliary police officers even when they didn't live in the county and that would [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=226.38s)]
*  allow them to bring guns around the country right and it would also allow [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  people who were convicted felons to have weapons and so he was basically taking [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=234.89999999999998s)]
*  cash in exchange for this benefit I was what the jury found him and guilty of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=239.14s)]
*  there but because he was able to make that case that this was you know this [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=244.78s)]
*  that this was because of his politics you know he is someone who did regular [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=248.34s)]
*  interviews with Breitbart the you know obviously the administration seems [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=251.94s)]
*  sympathetic to that and the now pardoned attorney at the Justice Department Ed [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=255.58s)]
*  Martin was able to get that you know that was the first case that he sort of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=259.94s)]
*  handled that he's also going to be reviewing of course he said and met with [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=263.78s)]
*  a lawyer who was making the case for all of the individuals who were not pardoned [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=267.94s)]
*  in connection with the January 6 attack all most people were pardoned but there [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=272.06s)]
*  is that narrow category of individuals from those far-right groups the Proud [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=276.34s)]
*  Boys and the Oath Keepers who are not and they want their pardons now they [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=279.74s)]
*  were only granted clemency meaning that they were all freed but their convictions [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=283.34s)]
*  still stand so they're they're now working to get those tossed out as well [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=287.02s)]
*  and Ed Martin actually met with one of the lawyers who is representing them [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=290.62s)]
*  just last week and accepted those applications and those are working [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=295.26s)]
*  their way through the system so I think that that that access point you know [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=298.7s)]
*  this is not the normal system that we're going through through the Justice [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=301.66s)]
*  Department where there's often a lengthy process often a really thorough review [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=304.18s)]
*  and you know critics would say it would take too long to get through that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=308.54s)]
*  process previously in different administrations yeah and you and I were [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=311.22s)]
*  talking when Ed Martin was pulled from contention to be the US Attorney in DC [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=314.42s)]
*  we now see that this new role that he's found himself in still allows him a lot [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=320.22s)]
*  of leverage and power the other piece of this too when we're talking about what [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=324.3s)]
*  could come next is you look at Trump leaving the door open to consider [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=327.98s)]
*  pardons for the men who were convicted of allegedly trying to kidnap the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=331.82s)]
*  governor of Michigan I mean this was at the height of concerns of political [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=336.74s)]
*  violence that very much still permeate the political realm what would it say if [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=340.86s)]
*  this pardon were to come down and what are the considerations here yeah there [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=345.5s)]
*  are really big you know there's huge allegations in that case obviously [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=349.38s)]
*  there's also some controversy in that case involving you know members of the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=352.90000000000003s)]
*  FBI BuzzFeed News had done some reporting contemporaneously about what was [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=355.94s)]
*  going on with that case so there's been a lot of criticism especially on the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=359.46s)]
*  right especially from the same critics of the January 6th prosecutions about [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=362.62s)]
*  that case in particular of course people who are just broadly critical of the FBI [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=365.9s)]
*  Ali yeah a lot for us to continue watching here but the pardon train is [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=370.17999999999995s)]
*  certainly rolling and has been this week [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=375.85999999999996s)]
*  you [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HBb7looGWE&t=385.9s)]
