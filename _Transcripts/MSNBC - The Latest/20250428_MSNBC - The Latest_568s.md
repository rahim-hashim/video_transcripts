# ’ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!’: Trump slams polls showing decline in his approval rating
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY)
*  Welcome back. Just a day to go until the end of President Trump's first 100 days in office, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=0.0s)]
*  and new polling is showing a considerable drop in his approval, including in some of his key issues. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=4.96s)]
*  A number of recent polls show Trump underwater, with more than half of Americans disapproving [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=10.72s)]
*  of his performance overall. And when you look at issues like immigration and the economy, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=15.84s)]
*  where he was previously strong, Trump's numbers are upside down there as well. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  The president, perhaps unsurprisingly, taking note of it in taking note of these headlines, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  posting on social media this morning to call them sick, and those who write about them [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=29.04s)]
*  the enemy of the people, adding, he thinks these pollsters should be investigated for election [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=33.2s)]
*  fraud. Joining me now is Sam Stein, managing editor of the Bullwork and an MSNBC contributor, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  and Susan Del Perccio, Republican strategist and an MSNBC political analyst. Sam, first to you, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=42.64s)]
*  any surprises in these numbers that we see? I guess in the macro sense, yeah, how quickly [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  it's all fallen apart, right? First of all, Trump didn't start off necessarily at a high note. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=55.84s)]
*  Relative to what he was in the first term, it was improved, but relative to other presidents, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=61.6s)]
*  it was not a great starting point for a newly elected president, or in this case, I guess, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  a second term president. But it's all kind of come apart fairly fast, and it's all been fairly [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=71.04s)]
*  self-inflicted. That's the other surprise. The trade wars, the tariffs, Liberation Day, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=76.4s)]
*  those all took obviously a huge chunk out of his approval rating. But then you look at the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=84.0s)]
*  immigration stuff too, and there was a case where he had immense popularity. The public was clearly [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=88.8s)]
*  backing his initiatives. And what did he do? He took a winning issue and he turned it into a kind [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=95.28s)]
*  of secondary issue, which is, can he and should he be able to defy the courts? And on that front, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=100.8s)]
*  he's really lost ground with the public. And I think these are self-inflicted wounds, and it's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=106.48s)]
*  not like he has one thing that he could hold on to now to claw his way back, or conversely, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=111.28s)]
*  not like there's one thing that's causing the downfall. It's across the spectrum on all the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=117.44s)]
*  issues, which makes it that much harder for him to crawl back up in popularity. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=121.84s)]
*  I think that's a really important point here, and the self-inflicted nature of it, of course, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=125.2s)]
*  cannot go unstated. But Susan, we've seen immigration be a consistently key issue for Trump as he [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=129.76s)]
*  continues to push his mass deportation efforts. But again, the polling shows, as Sam mentioned, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=135.92s)]
*  that a majority of Americans do not approve. And the larger question here is whether or not these [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=141.2s)]
*  bad polls will play the same role as, frankly, a diving stock market did, be a force that could [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=146.64s)]
*  make the administration scale back or reverse course. What do you think? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, first, I think when it comes to the immigration numbers going down, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=157.6s)]
*  and Sam touched on this, it's about the due process and also what the messaging was. He was [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=161.76s)]
*  going to take violent criminals and deport them. And now we see mothers who do the right thing and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  check in with ICE on their six-month renewal or not renewal, but check-in time that they're required [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=174.48s)]
*  to do. Then they get arrested two days later and their child's deported. That's not what Americans [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  signed up for. He should have stayed on violent criminals. That's the first part. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=188.96s)]
*  The second part, I don't think Donald Trump really will respond that much to these poll numbers. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  He's gotten away with a lot thus far with just his base, as long as his base holds for him. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=198.88s)]
*  He got through January 6. He got through having a mugshot. And he got through 34 felony convictions. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  That's where he's focused. The problem that he will have is moving his agenda with members of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=214.0s)]
*  the House who are up for reelection in two years. And they can't go along with all this. They can't [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=219.12s)]
*  have him anchoring them down. I think that's the really important connection piece there, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=226.64s)]
*  because Sam, we talk about immigration. We can also talk about the economy, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=232.4s)]
*  because in the Washington Post ABC Ipsos poll, 53% say the economy is worse since Trump took office. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=235.44s)]
*  72% believe Trump's policies will cause a recession. We've also heard those warnings [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  from Wall Street. Is it sentiments like these that could ultimately upend an election? I think the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=246.8s)]
*  if there, Sam, is if it can be sustained, which then of course puts the onus on Democrats to carry [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  this issue of the economy as a through line from now all the way until next November. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=258.56s)]
*  There's a bit of a risk of overanalyzing this. I think pretty much what's happening is people are [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=265.44s)]
*  saying, no, I don't think things are getting better. And my economic situation isn't getting [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=270.4s)]
*  better. And Trump promised me our situation was going to get better. And it's not. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=273.84s)]
*  That's pretty simple stuff. And if you're a member of Congress, what do you do when you're [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=277.28s)]
*  faced with that? There's one way, which is you can try to show that you're a bulwark against Trump, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=282.24s)]
*  that you're pushing back. Maybe you take votes saying, hey, we're going to take back the power [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=288.4s)]
*  of the tariffs, or at least have a ceremony of votes saying we disagree with this stuff. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  But the other way is that you have to show that you're doing action, that you're taking action, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=297.12s)]
*  I should say. And there's really frankly only one vehicle for them to do that in, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=301.44s)]
*  and that's this reconciliation vehicle. So conversely, or ironically, perhaps, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=305.04s)]
*  the floundering popularity numbers, the feeling of unease that many voters have about the economy [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  could compel Republicans to say, no, we have to do something. We can't just sit on our hands. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=316.16s)]
*  We have to show that we're giving the voters something. And that might compel them to actually [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=320.8s)]
*  get that big bill done. And we are watching these competing interests on Capitol Hill as they start [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=325.12s)]
*  to come back to town after a two-week recess. You've got the budget hucks, of course, who are [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=330.88s)]
*  saying they need to see more than a trillion dollars in cuts. You've got more moderate members [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=335.12s)]
*  saying they won't accept anything that includes cuts to Medicaid, despite the fact that almost [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=339.36s)]
*  definitely we're going to see those cuts because the Energy and Commerce Committee can only cut [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=344.56s)]
*  from so many other places. But Susan, I want to drill down on a larger takeaway that really [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=348.72s)]
*  struck me, and this one was from our NBC News Stay Tuned polling. Around the gender gap, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=354.24s)]
*  specifically among Gen Z voters, which are voters under 30, 45 percent of Gen Z men say they approve [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=359.2s)]
*  of Trump's overall job performance compared to 25 percent of women. That's a 21-point difference. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=366.0s)]
*  The divide is also visible on what issues they care about, too. But more, if we could zoom out [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=372.0s)]
*  a little bit, Susan, it feels like this is a cultural and political realignment that could have [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=377.2s)]
*  long-lasting implications for both parties, specifically among younger voters who are [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=382.56s)]
*  growing up with a really skewed worldview and a much different worldview than their male or female [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=387.76s)]
*  counterparts. Yeah, when it comes to those younger male voters, Donald Trump made a big effort to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=393.2s)]
*  reach out to them, and it helped. It certainly did. And when it comes to the younger women, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=399.52s)]
*  I think they're finally realizing that someone maybe of my age knew right away, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=406.56s)]
*  is that rights were being taken away from them. They've never known anything but growing up [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=411.92s)]
*  where you could be pro-choice. They've never seen things taken, and that's what [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=419.12s)]
*  Donald Trump has done, and it disproportionately affects women. It's not surprising to see women [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=425.68s)]
*  on cultural issues finding Donald Trump as a bully, for example. So those do play, and what, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=431.44s)]
*  again, going to those midterm elections, which it all comes down to in a lot of ways, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=438.48s)]
*  women tend to show up in those midterm elections if properly motivated. So the Democrats are [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=443.2s)]
*  equally challenged because they don't have a message, but if they could get one, they could [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=449.2s)]
*  probably bring out those women. Yeah, I think, Sam, the same question, though, on the other side of [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=453.2s)]
*  the gender equation, which is what do Democrats have to do to start appealing to some of these [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=458.08s)]
*  male voters, both across the board, but specifically with young men that veered away from the party? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=462.56s)]
*  The first thing they have to do is talk to them. They're not going to reach them unless they talk [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=470.0s)]
*  to them, and we're starting to see some members of the party make the overtures and make the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=474.08s)]
*  appearances on the programs that they watch and adopt some of the new social media tools that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=480.79999999999995s)]
*  these people are using as well. But it's not that profound. And frankly, part of that is because [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=485.6s)]
*  I think it's part of it because they don't have the communicators effectively to do it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=494.88s)]
*  But also we have to keep in mind, Trump kind of blots out everything else, right? Like no matter [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=499.52000000000004s)]
*  what is happening, the storyline is Donald Trump. And he does have a better hold on those voters [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=503.68s)]
*  than he does on their female counterparts in that generational cohort, but it is slipping. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=509.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think if I were the white house, I would find that troubling because that's the place where [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=514.4s)]
*  you invested tons of resources, made tons of overtures and outreach. If that starts to slip, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=518.56s)]
*  then you're in real trouble. Democrats do have to make a play for it, but I think ultimately [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  this really does come down to Trump and a referendum on his legacy and his time in office. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  As it so often does and as midterms, the first year midterms after a presidential so often do, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=535.04s)]
*  always a referendum. The always profound Sam Stein and Susan Del Purcio. Thank you both for coming on with us. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RNHcNcGBY&t=541.84s)]
