# 'Policy of deprivation': Gazans scramble for aid after going days without food
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo)
*  coming out of Gaza, hordes of people raced to a new controversial aid distribution center [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=0.0s)]
*  backed by the United States and Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=5.76s)]
*  Many people in Gaza, Palestinians, hadn't eaten for days and scrambled to get any food [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=8.24s)]
*  that was available. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=12.68s)]
*  Here's how the former U.N. humanitarian chief has now described the situation playing out [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=13.68s)]
*  there. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=18.0s)]
*  MANUEL RUIZ, U.N. UNHCR Chief of Staff, Gaza, United States This is unequivocal. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=19.0s)]
*  Of course it is genocide, just as it is weaponizing aid. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=21.48s)]
*  We don't need to look behind ourselves to see that that's the case. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=27.14s)]
*  ARI IMAGIN, Israeli Prime Minister, Haaretz He's not the only one ringing alarm bells. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=30.66s)]
*  Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert wrote in Haaretz, quote, what we are doing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=33.980000000000004s)]
*  in Gaza now is a war of devastation, indiscriminate, limitless cruel and criminal killing of civilians. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=38.36s)]
*  It is the result of government policy, knowingly evil, maliciously irresponsible, dictated. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=45.2s)]
*  Yes, Israel is committing war crimes. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  Of course, all of this comes as more questions are raised about whether or not there will [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=53.78s)]
*  be a ceasefire reached. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=57.58s)]
*  Today, President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, wrote on X that Hamas' response [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=59.18s)]
*  to the United States' proposal is, quote, totally unacceptable and only takes us backwards, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=64.06s)]
*  and that Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=69.38s)]
*  talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=74.5s)]
*  Joining me now is Arwa Damon. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=78.94s)]
*  She is the president and founder of the humanitarian organization Inara. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=80.26s)]
*  It operates in Gaza and other several countries in the region. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=83.66s)]
*  Arwa, it's good to see you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=86.78s)]
*  I want to start by what we just saw there and what has played out this week on the ground [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=88.02s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=91.46s)]
*  The UN and other aid organizations are not cooperating with this new American-Israeli-backed [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=92.66s)]
*  group known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=98.14s)]
*  As somebody who operates an organization there, as somebody who's been on the ground there, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=101.42s)]
*  why do you think this was predetermined to fall? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=105.58s)]
*  Foundation was predetermined to fail despite all the warnings from aid groups. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=109.86s)]
*  Well, let me first say that aid organizations, Aiman, as you well know, are not cooperating [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=114.82s)]
*  with this Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, first and foremost, because it is not a system that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=121.26s)]
*  delivers effective and or humane humanitarian assistance. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=126.9s)]
*  What we are seeing right now very much seems to be a shift in policy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=132.02s)]
*  The policy that has been implemented by Israel, that being the policy of starvation, now shifting [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=136.29999999999998s)]
*  towards a policy of very deliberate attempts to try to create a situation of chaos, which [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=141.7s)]
*  is exactly what we're seeing, and a policy of deprivation that all but ensures that not [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  everyone is going to survive. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=158.18s)]
*  It is no surprise that when you starve over two million people and only set up a handful [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=161.46s)]
*  of aid distribution sites, that chaos is going to erupt and emerge. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=168.82s)]
*  There's a reason why there are over 400 distribution sites that are run by the United Nations, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=173.66s)]
*  even more run by other organizations such as myself, to ensure that aid does actually [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=179.98s)]
*  get to the hands of the people. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=185.18s)]
*  What we are really sensing right now is that this whole attempt is just another effort [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  to try to orchestrate the movement of the population of Gaza and, again, ensure that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  very few people are actually able to access this much-needed humanitarian assistance. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=202.3s)]
*  You hear the desperation in people's voices when you talk to them, Aiman, I'm in touch [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=208.02s)]
*  with doctors, I'm talking to friends I've made among the journalists on the ground there, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=213.06s)]
*  I'm talking to my own team. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=217.94s)]
*  You hear the sheer exhaustion in their voices as if they've reached a point where just [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=220.14s)]
*  formulating a sentence is an enormous task for them. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=225.54s)]
*  The Palestinian UN ambassador broke down in tears describing the deaths of children in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=233.14s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=239.82s)]
*  I want everyone to take a listen. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=240.82s)]
*  To me, this is horrible. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=248.82s)]
*  Excuse me, Mr. President, I have grandchildren. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=257.82s)]
*  I know what they mean to their families. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=264.02s)]
*  To see the situation of the Palestinians without us having hearts to do something is beyond [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=268.58s)]
*  the ability of any normal human being to tolerate. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=276.90000000000003s)]
*  Aarwa, that is incredibly difficult to watch. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  It's heartbreaking. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=284.54s)]
*  Do you think anything is going to change, though? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=285.54s)]
*  Not as long as the U.S. continues to blindly or willingly stand by Israel and continue [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=291.48s)]
*  to support its ongoing policies in Gaza. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=298.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to believe that we've been witnessing 18, 19 months of this with [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=302.14s)]
*  children losing limbs, with children being so traumatized that they go nonverbal, with [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=308.17999999999995s)]
*  entire families being basically wiped off the registrar. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=314.58s)]
*  I speak to, again, colleagues and friends in Gaza, and they don't understand how it [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=319.26s)]
*  is that the world is actually allowing never again to happen again. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=325.9s)]
*  And it's not even just that the world is allowing never again to happen again, that it's actually [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=331.5s)]
*  being backed by a country, the United States, that continuously tries to proclaim itself [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=335.38s)]
*  as sort of upholding the beacon of international human rights and democracies. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=340.82s)]
*  It really just defies logic. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=346.5s)]
*  Aarwa, there are a lot of Israelis who are upset by what has happened, who do not like [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=348.53999999999996s)]
*  the idea that this is being done in their name, and who want this war to end so that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=354.53999999999996s)]
*  the hostages can be released and this campaign can stop. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=359.42s)]
*  What do you think the likelihood is that we are anywhere near a ceasefire, given that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=365.06s)]
*  Netanyahu potentially stands to hold onto power longer, the longer that the war goes on? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=371.1s)]
*  Anyone who's observing this with sort of a modicum of understanding of how war actually [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=378.86s)]
*  works or what the best strategy would be to bring the hostages home understands that what [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=384.94s)]
*  we're seeing unfolding on the ground in Gaza is just the complete and total opposite of that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=390.46s)]
*  If we look at the ceasefire negotiations right now, unfortunately, and I loathe saying this, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=395.62s)]
*  but it does seem as if they are at something of an impasse. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=401.14s)]
*  To sort of sum it up in a nutshell, Hamas wants to go back to the original ceasefire [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=404.29999999999995s)]
*  that was actually brokered by now President Trump back then. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=410.78s)]
*  He really just pushed it through before he came into office and have it lead to some sort of a guarantee [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=415.38s)]
*  of a longer lasting solution, whereas Israel wants to be able to continue bombing after 60 days. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=420.53999999999996s)]
*  And so that makes it extraordinarily difficult right now at this stage to see beyond any of this. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sd33G52zyo&t=426.9s)]
