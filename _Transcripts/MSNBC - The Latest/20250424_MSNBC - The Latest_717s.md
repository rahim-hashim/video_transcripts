# Cardinals prepare for Pope Francis’ funeral Saturday and upcoming conclave
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo)
*  We begin here at the Vatican, where tens of thousands of mourners keep streaming by Pope Francis's coffin, hour by hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=0.0s)]
*  So many that the Vatican kept the doors to St. Peter's Basilica open all night long and into the early morning hours. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=7.68s)]
*  The lines today not as long, but essentially unbroken since yesterday morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=14.4s)]
*  Today the Vatican announced that 130 international delegations will attend Saturday's funeral, including 50 heads of state. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=19.44s)]
*  That's along with roughly 100,000 people expected to come to Rome that day, an estimate just released by top officials. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  And earlier today, the Vatican produced this rendering of the Pope's final resting place, a simple marble stone at his grave inside the Basilica of St. Mary Major, marked with a cross and his name, Franciscus. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=35.28s)]
*  At the same time, 113 cardinals gathered in Vatican City to meet for a third day of what's called a general congregation, a meeting as they continue to arrive for the funeral and then, of course, the conclave in the coming weeks. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  They met this morning at an audience hall, 34 of them speaking behind closed doors, more formal discussions than the conversations happening informally around Vatican City and beyond among the cardinals and the curious in St. Peter's Square. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=61.04s)]
*  Earlier I was standing there just below where I am right now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=76.16s)]
*  It is another hot and sunny day in Rome that hasn't stopped thousands of people from pouring in to three different checkpoints. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=81.76s)]
*  These are security points. Once people get through there, it can be an hour's long wait before they get into the Basilica and can pay their respects to the late pope. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=88.56s)]
*  But I also want to show you what's happening behind the Basilica. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=97.2s)]
*  That is the place in Vatican City where people can't go, the public can't go. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=101.12s)]
*  And that is where you will find Casa Santa Marta, the place where Pope Francis lived for his entire papacy and the place where now cardinals are already moving in, in anticipation of the conclave. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=107.2s)]
*  It is a nondescript building. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  The bedrooms inside very simple, but it is the place where Pope Francis said mass in the chapel where he was brought after his death. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=122.96s)]
*  He used to work there and would often eat there in the cafeteria where one insider told me the food is famously bad. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  It's not big enough to house all of the cardinals, but very nearby, just a few minutes walk, is a German compound with dorms that we are told is being cleared out so that there will be room for all 135 cardinals. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=139.44s)]
*  And they are eligible to vote in this conclave. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=152.8s)]
*  There is more there behind the Basilica in the private areas of Vatican City, the Vatican Bank. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=155.44s)]
*  There's a museum, but maybe most importantly is a park area. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=161.68s)]
*  It was a favorite with popes. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=165.84s)]
*  It's a place where they could go to get fresh air and prayer. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=167.28s)]
*  But it is also, we are told, where cardinals can go to get away from the prying eyes of journalists, of the public, where there's no chance of anyone overhearing them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=170.72000000000003s)]
*  And they have an opportunity for them to talk with each other, perhaps about what the criteria are that they want to see in the next pope. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=181.84s)]
*  There's one more place I should tell you about. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=192.08s)]
*  It's up in the hills beyond where I am standing, and it is colloquially called the NAC, the North American College, where American seminarians are trained. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=194.32s)]
*  But it is where between now and the conclave, the American cardinals will be staying and where they will also have a chance in privacy to talk about what they're thinking as they head into that very important place, the Sistine Chapel, where they will all stand in front of Michelangelo's famous fresco, The Last Judgment, which depicts essentially the end of the world. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=203.2s)]
*  For their purposes, it is the end of one papacy and the place where they will have to come face to face as Pope Francis wanted it with God and with their conscience, put a ballot in and decide who will be the next person to lead the Catholic Church. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=230.96s)]
*  Joining me now is Christopher White, MSNBC contributor and Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=250.68s)]
*  We know that wasn't the last judgment, but that was basically Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, just in case they thought we didn't know that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=256.48s)]
*  NBC's Molly Hunter is here at the Vatican. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=264.72s)]
*  Deborah Lueboff is MSNBC's Vatican analyst and contributor. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=267.64000000000004s)]
*  So, Deborah, the first question I know everybody wants the answer to, what's happening behind closed doors where these cardinals are meeting now, that meeting today where so many of them spoke, if we could hear what they're saying, could it give us some early clearances? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=271.48s)]
*  What clues ahead of the conclave? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=286.48s)]
*  If only we could, certainly those details are a mystery for everyone. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  But what we do know is that Pope Francis, throughout his pontificate, was always an advocate of this idea called synodality that seemed a little abstract. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  But basically, it was his hallmark, one of the hallmarks of his pontificate, to speak freely and frankly, whether someone agrees with you or not, and to not hold back. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=302.56s)]
*  Certainly, what one would expect is that there would be this constant openness to make an intervention, to not hold back. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=312.08s)]
*  So there were 34 interventions made by different cardinals today, as noted by Matteo Bruni in the Holy See Press Office earlier. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=321.11999999999995s)]
*  But the contents, we do not know what they are, but certainly for the church and the church in the world and other arrangements and decisions to be made. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  So, Chris, we just showed you where the cardinals are staying. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  We showed you a little bit of the area where they might be outside walking. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  Pull back the curtain a little bit for us. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  What are these days like? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=350.08s)]
*  And frankly, the logistics for wrangling more than 100 cardinals. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  Often whom are quite advanced in age and take some time to get around. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=356.4s)]
*  These guys are spending a lot of time talking together, some of them, hopefully, perhaps praying together. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=360.96s)]
*  But they're going to talk about what needs they see in the church in this moment, and they're going to look at the world around it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=366.24s)]
*  And if you roll back the clock to 2013, issues like abuse and finances top the list. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=370.16s)]
*  The church is in a different place now. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=375.20000000000005s)]
*  I think they're going to be very externally focused. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=376.64000000000004s)]
*  The world is at war, and I think they're going to say, who can lead us through this? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=378.88000000000005s)]
*  All right. So it's been nearly 200 years since the conflict took more than a week. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=382.0s)]
*  What can these conversations that are happening now hope to accomplish? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=387.44000000000005s)]
*  Could it speed up the process or is that asking too much? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  I think many of these guys, they don't know one another. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=393.84s)]
*  They come from all sort of pockets of the globe and they're not often in Rome together. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=396.0s)]
*  So they're going to have lots of coffees together and they're going to kick the tires a bit and audition one another and say, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=399.2s)]
*  could I see that guy leading the Catholic church in this moment? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=403.52s)]
*  And then I think consensus will emerge and someone from Africa will say, I talked to this guy and I think he has an attractive vision. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=406.4s)]
*  Go talk to him, too. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=412.4s)]
*  So, Molly, are people in the crowds talking about what they want to see in the next poker or is today still very much about Pope Francis? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  Chris, I think it's both. As you mentioned, the lines were slightly shorter, but still moving today. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=423.84s)]
*  So still tens of thousands of people are going inside to say their final goodbyes, final respects. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=427.76s)]
*  And we did see pictures actually of his family sitting by that open coffin. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  Of course, I think it's really interesting what struck me. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=436.23999999999995s)]
*  And we've both been down in St. Peter's Square a lot talking to people after they've had that really powerful private moment. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=438.0s)]
*  And my experience has been that a lot of people are smiling. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  They may have puffy eyes. They may feel overwhelmed. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=446.79999999999995s)]
*  But even in the short walk it takes from being inside the Basilica down into the square where we've been talking to people, they kind of are able to feel lighter. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=449.44s)]
*  And we've been asking people, why are they smiling? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=456.88s)]
*  And a lot of it is because they feel like he's at peace now, that he is happy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  The other thing, Chris, and the conversation always does go to, well, if you were a fan of Pope Francis, is this what you want to see? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=462.48s)]
*  And this is not in any way a sample size, certainly not a professional poll, but almost everyone we've spoken with was a great fan of Pope Francis. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=468.64s)]
*  And the thing that they point out more than anything after leaving St. Peter's Basilica, where, of course, we know he is lying in state at ground level, at an accessible level, is they feel incredibly close. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=475.96s)]
*  They leave feeling closer than they ever have. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=485.79999999999995s)]
*  And they say they've gotten used to that feeling over his pontificate. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=487.68s)]
*  And they'd like to see that continue. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  Deborah, I want to get into some of the debates around Francis' successor and one of them regards age. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  There is a suggestion that many folks in the conclave are talking about somebody older because it means they won't have to serve for a long time. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=499.72s)]
*  But, of course, the last three popes were among the oldest ever. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=507.8s)]
*  All of them had health issues that impacted their ability to serve. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=511.0s)]
*  And, of course, Benedict ultimately stepped down because he thought he couldn't do the job the way he wanted to. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=514.0s)]
*  How old is too old? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=520.44s)]
*  It's an impossible question to answer. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=524.36s)]
*  But at the same time, if you think about it, a surprising fact was that Benedict was elected at age 78. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=526.92s)]
*  And by the time he passed away, he was ninety-five. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=533.36s)]
*  It would have been almost a 20-year pontificate had he not resigned. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=537.12s)]
*  He didn't think he was up for it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=541.08s)]
*  But technically, it would have been a very, very long pontificate. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=542.04s)]
*  So I think even 80 is starting to seem young. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=545.52s)]
*  So many people tend to think that anyone too young would be not very, very likely. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=547.92s)]
*  But normally after the age of 80, there wouldn't be much of a possibility. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=554.32s)]
*  But you never know. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=558.0400000000001s)]
*  And then, of course, there's the great debate about what kind of person it will be. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=560.72s)]
*  Will it be someone perhaps more conservative? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=564.32s)]
*  Some people would put in that category. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  The cardinal in Budapest, Hungary. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=569.36s)]
*  Would it be someone more progressive? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=571.4000000000001s)]
*  And a lot of people have suggested in appointing so many cardinals that Francis was kind of stacking the deck, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=573.32s)]
*  hoping to put in somebody who might continue some of the things that he did that were seen as groundbreaking. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=580.52s)]
*  Is that a fair way of looking at it? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=587.04s)]
*  Well, every pope stacks the deck. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=589.44s)]
*  These are his men. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=591.08s)]
*  So every pope chooses men who they want to reflect their vision of the church. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=592.16s)]
*  And so I think there are 80 percent of these guys that were named by Francis. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=596.0s)]
*  It's fair to say that they share his priorities. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=599.28s)]
*  It doesn't mean that they're cookie cutters of Francis. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=602.0s)]
*  They all have their own issues that motivate them, their own backgrounds that they're going to bring to the table. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=604.9200000000001s)]
*  But I think it's more likely than not that we have a candidate for pope who's going to at least sort of share the pope's top priorities. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=609.16s)]
*  And anybody who's paying attention knows that popes have surprised before you thought you had a beat on them and they turn out to be something somewhat different. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=614.4s)]
*  Let's take a step back, Deborah. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=621.16s)]
*  We should note this conclave is unique in history. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=623.12s)]
*  It involves the largest number of eligible cardinal voters ever. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=625.8s)]
*  It's the most geographically diverse we've ever seen. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=630.36s)]
*  In fact, Pope Francis himself, as we said, not only pointed the most cardinals, but cardinals from 25 countries, I think, that had never had one before. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=632.92s)]
*  Does all that just add to what we're hearing is that this is wide open in what is already an unpredictable enterprise that we happen to call the conclave? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=642.0s)]
*  Well, most certainly, Pope Francis has given amazing space in Asia and in Africa. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=653.88s)]
*  But as you noted, in countries that people hadn't even heard of and even unfortunately, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=660.28s)]
*  some of the cardinals who Pope Francis appointed had passed away before Pope Francis from those very countries. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=665.24s)]
*  But certainly, as Chris had mentioned, there's this fact that they don't really know each other yet, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=672.04s)]
*  except from, I had mentioned earlier, those synods where some of them had gathered in the Vatican in order to discuss and listen to what the faithful of the Catholic Church want in this moment. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=677.72s)]
*  It's not that the Pope changed things very much after those, but he wanted that voice and that sort of representation. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=688.64s)]
*  So at this time, we'll have to see. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066s3Tx7ifo&t=694.36s)]
