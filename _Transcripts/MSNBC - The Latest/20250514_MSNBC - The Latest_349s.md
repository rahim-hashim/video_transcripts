# 'Name and shame': DOJ 'weaponization' group will shame people it can't charge with crimes
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8)
*  Joining us now from DC with his reporting, NBC's Ryan Reilly, with me here, Jeremy Peters, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=0.0s)]
*  reporter for The New York Times and an MSNBC contributor. Ryan, to name and shame, do we know [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=5.92s)]
*  what Ed Martin means by that? Yeah, it is a major departure from what the Justice Department [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=12.64s)]
*  traditionally does, which is charge cases. There's, you know, long-standing precedent [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=17.84s)]
*  and rules within the Justice Department about not using derogatory information against individuals [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=22.8s)]
*  when they don't feel as though they can actually go into court and prove that that person committed [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=27.2s)]
*  a crime and that while derogatory information sometimes comes out over the course of an [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=31.52s)]
*  investigation or over the course of a prosecution, it's not something that you're bringing out [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=34.96s)]
*  against people when you're not actually bringing them to court. Here's a clip of what Ed Martin had [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=39.44s)]
*  to say. There are some really bad actors, some people that did some really bad things to the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=43.68s)]
*  American people, and if they can be charged, we'll charge them, but if they can't be charged, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=50.16s)]
*  we will name them, and we will name them. And in a culture that respects shame, they should be [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=55.2s)]
*  people that are shamed, and that's a fact. That's the way things work, and so that's how I believe [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  the job operates. That's just not traditionally how a job within the Justice Department does [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  operate, but you know, as head of this weaponization working group, I think he's going to be taking a [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  much different approach. He did say that he's going to be doing a lot of media hits and that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  he was told that this is a lot more sort of a front-facing role, and he is saying that he's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=81.68s)]
*  going to basically be updating the public very frequently. He's making a lot of appearances on [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  some conservative news organizations since his departure was announced, so I think we can expect [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=92.4s)]
*  more of this in the future. This isn't going to look like your traditional Justice Department [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  investigation, where it might end in some sort of lengthy report. I don't think that's probably [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  what we're going to be looking at here from this weaponization group, Chris. Ryan, thank you for [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=106.64000000000001s)]
*  that. So Jeremy, naming and shaming, it goes beyond breaking with traditional DOJ procedures. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=110.96s)]
*  What we know is people who have been named and shamed in the past have been put in the path of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=118.24s)]
*  danger. Right, and death threats, threats to their personal safety are certainly a possibility. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=122.8s)]
*  Their families? Their families, right, and we've seen that not apply, not only apply to defendants [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=129.2s)]
*  in some cases, but also to prosecutors and the judges who hear these cases. Look, Chris, as you [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=135.12s)]
*  know, there's nothing traditional about the way this administration approaches the law, but this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=140.24s)]
*  is an area, once again, where Trump and his staff seem to be operating within the bounds of the law, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=144.72s)]
*  but in a way that degrades the norms around the law. And that's really problematic here, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=151.84s)]
*  because what you're talking about is not somebody in a prosecutorial role, which Ed Martin should be. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=157.52s)]
*  You're talking about somebody almost in kind of like a heckling role, which, believe it or not, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=164.48s)]
*  is actually pretty fitting for this administration. Well, yeah, I mean, he expects to be doing a lot [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  of media hits. Then your colleague, Glenn Thrush, wrote about Attorney General Pan Bondi essentially [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=177.12s)]
*  being a messenger, right, for the West Wing. Today we have Janine Pirro. She is an actual TV host and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=185.76s)]
*  a very practiced messenger. She's named as DC's top prosecutor. What does it tell us about this [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=192.08s)]
*  administration? I'm sensing a pattern. Loyalty. That's all it is. I mean, really, you have Janine [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  Pirro, who, you know, as far as her qualifications go, she has them, right? She was a judge, a district [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=204.72000000000003s)]
*  attorney in Westchester. She ran for Senate. She ran for attorney general against Andrew Cuomo in 2006 [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=212.0s)]
*  and didn't win her television career, kind of took off after that. But she's been friends with [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=219.52s)]
*  the Trumps and the Trump family for a very long time. If I recall correctly, I believe Don Jr. and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=225.68s)]
*  the other Trump children used to go swimming in her pool when they were little kids. So Janine [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  Pirro has been an ally of Donald Trump's, including giving voice through her platform at Fox News to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=238.08s)]
*  some of the most false and conspiratorial lies about the 2020 election and how it was, you know, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=244.96s)]
*  supposedly stolen from Trump. So she has earned her place as far as Donald Trump and the loyalists [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  around him would say. You know, politically, we heard Democrats call Trump a threat to democracy [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  for years. Obviously, they didn't quite pan out in November, but it will be interesting to see [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  what they do up against what is truly an onslaught of people with profiles of their own. Janine Pirro [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=271.6s)]
*  certainly has a profile of her own. Pam Bondi has built a profile and a following of her own who are [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=278.88s)]
*  going to, by their own admission, be a messenger for this administration. Right. And as we know, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=284.72s)]
*  being a messenger in any administration is a pretty important role. In this one, it takes on [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  outsize importance because you have the President of the United States watching television very often [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=299.04s)]
*  and often watching the channels where these two women, Bondi, who I believe used to, if she wasn't [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  a Fox News contributor, she was certainly on Fox News an awful lot before she was named Trump's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=310.8s)]
*  nominee for AG. She was there a lot. And Janine, of course, is paid and has been for quite some time. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=316.16s)]
*  Paid well. Yes. Paid very well. Jeremy Peters, it's always good to have you on the show. Thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=323.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5G6ZDHRj8&t=329.04s)]
