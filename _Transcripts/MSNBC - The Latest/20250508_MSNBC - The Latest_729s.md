# ‘Buyer’s remorse’: Trump rejected by voters and markets as tariff chaos deepens slump
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU)
*  The markets. We've had these recession fears. We have a lot of Americans concerned about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=0.0s)]
*  what they're living through, what they're feeling in the problems with Donald Trump's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=4.8s)]
*  trade war and tariffs. There's new polling that actually shows this is not a left-right [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=9.28s)]
*  issue anymore, not one that goes half and half. This is 75 percent, a big majority of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=14.48s)]
*  Americans, concerned that the tariffs will juice prices. Sixty-one percent want businesses [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=20.88s)]
*  to actually say when the tariffs are affecting prices. Again, that's something the Trump [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=26.159999999999997s)]
*  administration has opposed. There was some back and forth with different retailers about it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=30.88s)]
*  Trump was angry and posting specifically about Amazon and Jeff Bezos about it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=35.76s)]
*  Ford raising prices on three different cars today and saying that the trade war will cut [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=42.4s)]
*  into their profits by over a billion dollars. These are the examples of what's been going. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=50.0s)]
*  If you follow the news, some days it's the top story, some days there's other things going on. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=55.6s)]
*  If you turn on the financial news or read the Wall Street press, it's every day. Toyota says [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=59.2s)]
*  the decline is not going to be a couple points here, but rather 20 percent, a fifth of their [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=65.2s)]
*  total profits, all because of Donald Trump's decision to stick to these tariffs. So it's not [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  going well by all of those measurable ways to look at it. The American businesses that we hear from, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=76.08s)]
*  small, medium, and large, say the tariffs are bad. Most governments view this as a kind of a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=83.12s)]
*  very Trumpian specific escalation, not something that was inevitable or the normal course of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  trade this year, just something that Trump barreled right into. In fact, when I show you [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=94.4s)]
*  75 percent of Americans concerned about the tariffs, you have to look around to find people [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=100.64s)]
*  who still think this might be a good idea. Here's Fox News' Laura Ingraham. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  No one wants what Trump is doing except, you know, the MAGA crowd, the reset [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=110.24s)]
*  crowd. Wall Street doesn't want to do this. That's part of how she was teeing up the issues to, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=118.8s)]
*  of course, one of the Trump officials who's involved in all this. Trump is trying to sell [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  austerity, but that's at odds with everything that he said during the campaign, right, that we would [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=131.12s)]
*  get prosperity and right away. Trump's Treasury Secretary says kids might have fewer dolls, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=135.52s)]
*  but they'll get in exchange economic freedom, which has become a national punchline. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=140.56s)]
*  Yes, if there's one thing children love, it's the concept of economic freedom. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=148.88s)]
*  They're raising prices on Barbie. Even she has to cut back. She had to move out of Barbie's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=153.52s)]
*  Dream House and into Barbie's dream studio apartment with two roommates. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=158.72s)]
*  Her pink convertible is now a 2007 Toyota Tercel. It's very sad. Come on, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=162.4s)]
*  don't make Barbie tighten her belt even more. She only has a one-inch waist. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=168.96s)]
*  The Barbie jokes can kind of give us all a little, little moment to exhale, but the punchline there [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=174.96s)]
*  that works, and it works regardless of who you voted for, or people who wanted a change from Biden, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=180.96s)]
*  or people who thought Trump would bring prosperity like he said he would, this isn't really about the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  partisan imprint from last year's election. This is now about the governing of President Trump and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=190.64s)]
*  how it's actually going, and people don't think it's going well. The punchline is there isn't [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  really a good other side of this debate. MAGA figures are looking at the trade deficits, and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=201.92s)]
*  remember, it's complicated. We've heard from economists, but by the Trump plan, meaning what [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=207.67999999999998s)]
*  he said this was about was dealing with the trade deficit countries, China, Mexico, Vietnam. Those [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=214.08s)]
*  are the big countries you see there where he says we're getting the raw end of the deal. That's what [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=221.28s)]
*  he and his allies have fixated on. With respect, are you overstating the reach and significance of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=226.4s)]
*  this deal because you're a president who needs a result at a difficult time? I think that it's a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=233.44s)]
*  great deal for both parties. Now, the world has been coming to the U.S. and China has been the missing [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=239.04s)]
*  piece. China wants to do something, and look, they have to at this point. You know, essentially, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=247.44s)]
*  they made a trillion dollars a year. You know, we almost had a deal with China, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  where we were going to open up China. It was almost done. China has taken over 60,000 of our [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=258.56s)]
*  factories, over 5 million manufacturing jobs. The conflict we're having with them cannot be [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=263.6s)]
*  understated, and we have to be clear-eyed about that. All right, so as far as Trump aides are [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=270.0s)]
*  concerned, including Peter Navarro, who's been on this program, can't be understated or overstated. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=276.88s)]
*  It is just the biggest deal to go after China and those other countries I showed you where you have [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=282.88s)]
*  this gap. So that's the whole priority. If you hear Donald Trump pop up today, tomorrow, or next [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=287.6s)]
*  week talking about other countries and other stuff, by his measure, forget anyone else, by his measure, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  that is not what the trade war is about. It's not why he started the tariffs, because again, he wanted [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=299.92s)]
*  to make up for the big deficit countries where basically he says America's getting a raw deal [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=305.04s)]
*  because we're buying more than we're selling, yada, yada, yada. That's his metric. Now, in addition, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  I can tell you, if you want to get into sort of the economics of fact-checking, and it's not black [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=316.96s)]
*  and white, but most mainstream economists have said, economic experts, economists, professors, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=320.96s)]
*  and people in the markets who do this day by day, they say that you actually don't think of trade [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  deficits as automatically bad. Indeed, there are many occasions where you want to run trade deficits. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=331.76s)]
*  To pick a very simple example, if you're a country that doesn't have the weather to make [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  bananas, then you're going to have a banana deficit because you want to ship them into your country. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=343.92s)]
*  That deficit isn't good or bad. It's just a product of reality. You don't make bananas. You [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  can't grow them here. People want them. You buy them. Add 100 other products, and you get the idea. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  But again, Trump says these tariffs will deal with what he calls these concerning trade deficits with [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  those countries like China and other countries in Asia. So keep that in mind when you learn that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  this week, you may have seen this if you've been on your phone or the internet today, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=373.12s)]
*  Trump has announced a relatively small partial agreement, but it's not with China. It's not with [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=376.56s)]
*  Vietnam. It's with the United Kingdom. And the United States, if you're using the Trump measure, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=384.16s)]
*  runs a trade surplus with them to about 12 billion last year. This kind of handshake trade deal does [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=391.92s)]
*  not end all the tariffs. Bloomberg reports the framework basically leaves many key details for [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=399.76s)]
*  later. Key issues unresolved. Apparently, the goal is to get some sort of claim of a deal or a partial [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=405.76s)]
*  deal headline out there and save the hard stuff for later. Paul Krugman, the Nobel-winning economist, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=413.76s)]
*  says that pretending to fix what's broke seems to be the order of the day, and it may or may not happen. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=419.52s)]
*  He also calls this the tariff equivalent of concepts of a plan, one of the Trump campaign [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=424.4s)]
*  gaps when he couldn't really say what the health care plan was last year. Now, in this new framework, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=430.64s)]
*  10% tariffs on many UK products remain. So as I'm telling you, it's a deal but not a deal that ends [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  the ramping up of his trade war with that and other countries. The tariffs would be reduced, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=443.12s)]
*  they say, for cars and steel. No final UK deal. No agreements with the priority countries. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=447.68s)]
*  And obviously not only no deal, but not even the concepts of the step of an initial [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  set of negotiations with China where the big Trump tariffs are at 145%, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=459.76s)]
*  where supply chains are disrupted, where we've had experts say the shelves in America may run bare. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=465.92s)]
*  And no amount of Bloomberg headlines about partial deals with England are going to change that [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  reality that is barreling at American consumers and voters. We are joined by the Reverend Al [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=477.92s)]
*  Sharpton, the host of Politics Nation, president of the National Action Network, a man who's known [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump for a long time and is fresh off the Met Gala, Catherine Rampel, host of MSNBC's The [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=487.44s)]
*  Weekend, and a Washington Post columnist. Welcome to both of you. We'll get to the economics because [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=493.6s)]
*  I walked through why this wasn't the deal that they had promised. But what do you think of what [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=500.24s)]
*  they're selling? Because, Rev, this is Trumpian politics first. You want headlines about some [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=505.36s)]
*  kind of deal before the actual trade negotiators reach a deal. And to say that you want some kind [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=512.24s)]
*  of deal is absurd. I mean, he promised on day one many things he hasn't delivered. And now, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=519.2s)]
*  I think you said it best to sell austerity rather than prosperity is something that is [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=527.52s)]
*  miles away from what he told his own constituents, but I think all his own supporters. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=534.96s)]
*  I think what is even more important is that he does not have a deal. There is no deal. He's [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=540.48s)]
*  announced something with England today that we really don't know what that really means. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=547.68s)]
*  We don't know what's going on with China. They can't even agree with who called the meeting. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=551.84s)]
*  And in the interim, we have Mother's Day coming up Sunday. Flowers are up. He's telling kids [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=556.48s)]
*  that they can't have dolls. I mean, this is the worst of the worst of Trump fumbling the ball. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=562.88s)]
*  And I think that a lot of voters that supported him are starting to get voters' remorse or buyers' [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  remorse. Buyers' remorse, yeah. Because I think that he clearly has not only not did what he said, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=576.72s)]
*  he's doing the opposite. He's causing inflation. He's causing it to stay where it is or rise. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=582.88s)]
*  And it's going to cause a lot to his base, farmers and others that depend on a lot of the things that [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=589.52s)]
*  he's putting tariffs on. Yeah. And Catherine, we've seen that in the new polling that the tariffs are [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=596.4s)]
*  getting less popular the more people hear about them. We all cover stuff, right? There aren't a [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=601.36s)]
*  lot of 75% issues in American politics. Really. I mean, you tell people, well, Biden did it or Trump [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=608.0s)]
*  did it. Right away, you start to get a fissure. 75% and growing is the concern. And I want to be [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=612.88s)]
*  clear, that doesn't mean that those Republicans are turning Democrat in the midterms. It just means [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=617.84s)]
*  they were rooting for Trump. They do like him. And they're still mad and concerned about tariffs. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=623.2800000000001s)]
*  Where does the deal fit into that? Well, Trump is essentially demanding wartime sacrifices from the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=628.4s)]
*  American people, even as he's giving himself a military parade that will cost tens of millions [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=634.48s)]
*  of dollars. He's saying that we're going to have higher prices not only on dolls. He's acknowledging [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=641.52s)]
*  higher prices on all sorts of baby goods, strollers. He was asked about that explicitly in the NBC Meet [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=647.6s)]
*  the Press interview over the weekend. Today, he even said maybe we'll raise the tariffs on [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3IGT8RtnU&t=653.84s)]
