# Ex-Rep. George Santos to be sentenced today in fraud case
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA)
*  Meanwhile, any minute now, former Republican Congressman George Santos is set to be sentenced [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=0.0s)]
*  in the fraud case that captured national attention. He now faces up to 87 months in prison after [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=4.4s)]
*  pleading guilty to federal wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. His lawyers have called for a two-year [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=10.8s)]
*  prison sentence. Santos was ousted from Congress in 2023 after the House Ethics Committee found he [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=16.56s)]
*  spent thousands of campaign donation dollars on things like Botox, high-end designer goods, and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=22.16s)]
*  lavish trips to Atlantic City and Las Vegas. Joining us now, NBC's Raheema Ellis, live outside [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=28.96s)]
*  the courthouse, and Tamadayo Aganga Williams, a former federal prosecutor in the Eastern District [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=34.4s)]
*  of New York. Raheema, what's happening inside the courthouse right now? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=39.36s)]
*  Well, Jose, because it's a federal courthouse, we don't have the ability to have someone in there [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=45.36s)]
*  on a computer or a phone who can send us out messages. But what I can say is this, that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=50.56s)]
*  hearing was scheduled to get underway at 1030. You showed some video just a moment ago of George [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=54.96s)]
*  Santos walking into the courthouse. So we can only guess that this is getting underway for this 36-year-old [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=60.0s)]
*  disgraced former congressman. There's the expectation that it will not take long. The prosecution has [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=65.84s)]
*  said that it will hold a news conference out here in front of the courthouse at the noon hour, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=71.44s)]
*  following the sentencing. A sentencing, as you pointed out, that George Santos is hoping that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=76.88s)]
*  he would be given the minimum sentence. And the minimum mandatory for aggravated identity theft is [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=81.28s)]
*  two years. The maximum would be 22. The prosecution is asking for something like 87 months. And it's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=87.28s)]
*  saying that George Santos should be given this because of the post that he has been making, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=93.92s)]
*  accusing or basically blaming what happened to him in terms of the charges against him, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=99.2s)]
*  calling it a witch hunt. The prosecution is saying that this shows that he has no remorse [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=105.04s)]
*  for even the allocution that he presented back in the summer when he pled guilty to two counts. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=109.92s)]
*  But George Santos is saying that he would like to ask the court to ignore those posts that he has [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=116.56s)]
*  made when they are sentencing him. So we hope to find out very soon what's going to happen [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=123.44s)]
*  to George Santos after what's been a career, a public career, of him saying one thing and his [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=129.28s)]
*  actual life appearing to be something else as he presented a whole history, if you will, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=136.56s)]
*  of falsehoods to the voters and donors here in the Long Island area in order to get elected to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=142.48s)]
*  Congress in the first place. Jose? So the defense asking for two years, the prosecution for 87 [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=148.32s)]
*  months. What are some of the legal factors the judge is going to be weighing when sentencing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=155.68s)]
*  Santos? So Jose, the judge is going to be considering what we call the 3553 factors, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=160.96s)]
*  which is a statute that lays out these various considerations. At the core are about the history [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=167.2s)]
*  and characteristics of the defendant. The judge is going to be considering who is George Santos, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=172.64s)]
*  and as part of that, she'll be considering his likelihood of committing crimes again, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=177.76s)]
*  the need to protect the public from him. She'll be considering whether he's been remorseful. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=182.32s)]
*  Should be considering the need to promote respect for the rule of law. But at bottom, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=187.36s)]
*  she's going to decide who is George Santos and compare that to what he did and decide what the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  public needs to be protected from him going forward. Here, these posts that he has engaged [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=198.24s)]
*  in, I think, are really going to harm him. What it shows is that he's not remorseful, that what [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=203.84s)]
*  he said at his plea, that I'm sorry, that I take responsibility, that is not holding true. His need [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=208.0s)]
*  for attention, his need to speak out has undercut his lawyer's very argument, and I expect the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=213.52s)]
*  judge will punish him for that and is more likely to impose a sentence closer to what the prosecutors [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=219.12s)]
*  are asking for of 87 months. And so, Temedalio, if that decision comes down, as Rojemos saying, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=224.24s)]
*  around noon, he would go right to prison? What's the process there? So the process, it depends [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=230.24s)]
*  what the government's going to want. So you can be what's called remanded, which means you are [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=236.4s)]
*  taken into custody right there at sentencing. It's often common that the defendants will ask [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=240.0s)]
*  for time to get their affairs in order, and I expect the judge is likely to give that to him, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=245.12s)]
*  to give him time to prepare for when to surrender and set a date in the future at some point. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=249.92s)]
*  But it is possible to get remanded. Sometimes folks do not leave the courthouse when they get [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=255.44s)]
*  sentenced, and part of the reason they might not be permitted to leave is whether they will commit [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=259.76s)]
*  more crimes if given their freedom. And he's shown his willingness to kind of thumb the nose of DOJ, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=263.92s)]
*  it could be on the table here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoNlU0mYAA&t=269.84s)]
