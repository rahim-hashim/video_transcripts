# 4-year-old could ‘die within days’ if deported under Trump order, doctors say
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0)
*  In 2023, the little girl you see here who's being identified as Sofia came to this country [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=0.0s)]
*  from Mexico with her parents. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  And the family was granted permission to temporarily stay here for humanitarian reasons. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=8.02s)]
*  They applied for it and was granted. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=12.3s)]
*  Because Sofia is ill and in need of life-saving treatment. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=14.44s)]
*  Now all that is in jeopardy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=18.02s)]
*  A critically ill toddler who has been receiving life-saving treatment in LA has been ordered [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=21.46s)]
*  to self-deport by the Trump administration. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=25.66s)]
*  But her doctors say she could die if that happens. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=28.3s)]
*  NBC4's Michelle Valles is live at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=31.46s)]
*  Michelle, tell us what the little girl's family is saying now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=34.5s)]
*  She's got a medical condition called short bowel syndrome which prevents her from absorbing [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=37.9s)]
*  nutrients and food. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=42.06s)]
*  They came here with permission in 2023 on humanitarian grounds to receive that life-saving [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=43.94s)]
*  medical care. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=51.3s)]
*  But last month the Trump administration ordered them to self-deport. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=52.7s)]
*  The mom tells us that according to doctors the little girl could die within days if she [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=56.84s)]
*  is sent back to Mexico. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Last month the Trump administration revoked permission to stay here and ordered the family [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=65.12s)]
*  to leave immediately. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=69.44s)]
*  This little four-year-old girl Sofia is not a criminal or a terrorist or Chendu Agua or [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=70.92s)]
*  obviously any threat of any kind. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  She's not a danger to Americans. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=77.04s)]
*  But she's among the many people targeted in the mass deportation dragon happening around [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=80.0s)]
*  the country under orders of Donald Trump and Stephen Miller. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=83.82s)]
*  Gina Amado-Lowe is one of the attorneys representing Sofia. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=87.66s)]
*  She's also the directing attorney for the Immigrant Rights Project and Public Council [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=90.61999999999999s)]
*  and she joins me now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=94.38s)]
*  Let me first just ask about the sort of medical status of Sofia in terms of the care that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=96.86s)]
*  she needs and gets. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=104.16s)]
*  My understanding from reading about her case was that she came very close to death in Mexico. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=105.16s)]
*  This is a treatable condition in some parts of the world including the U.S. but they were [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=109.61999999999999s)]
*  having a hard time getting the care in Mexico for her. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=113.14s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=117.06s)]
*  Yes, that's correct. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=118.06s)]
*  Sofia was receiving treatment in Mexico prior to coming to the United States. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=121.06s)]
*  However, she kept getting repeated blood infections and was doing very poorly. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=125.38s)]
*  So she and her parents came to the U.S. to seek humanitarian parole and subsequently [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=130.18s)]
*  Sofia has received treatment at a hospital in San Diego and then Children's Hospital [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=136.16s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=141.08s)]
*  With that treatment as you can see there she seems like she's doing pretty well and thriving. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=142.9s)]
*  This medical treatment she's received here in this country has been successful. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  Yes, her condition has improved substantially but her doctors have said that if her treatment [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  is interrupted she will die within days. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=161.3s)]
*  I think it's important to say that Sofia undergoes medical treatment at home 14 hours per day. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  She is required to basically be hooked up to an IV 14 hours a day and take a nutrients [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=170.7s)]
*  that way. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  She is also fed through a G-tube four times a day and she visits Children's Hospital [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  every six weeks or so. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=184.38s)]
*  She has just very intense specialized treatment that Children's Hospital specializes in. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  This is a world-class facility but more importantly the equipment that Sofia relies on to deliver [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  the nutrients to her system is not available outside of the United States and her doctors [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=200.66s)]
*  have clearly ordered her and the other patients that are undergoing this treatment to not [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=206.06s)]
*  leave the country. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  So her mother was sort of and the father dealing with this awful condition and trying to save [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=212.6s)]
*  their kid and my understanding is that the mom applied to the U.S. government through [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=217.57999999999998s)]
*  the CBP app right to say look there's a category of humanitarian carveouts is that right for [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=222.85999999999999s)]
*  folks to come in under these circumstances? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=227.78s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=230.9s)]
*  They presented themselves at the border the lawful way. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=231.9s)]
*  They requested humanitarian parole for medical purposes and the government granted them humanitarian [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=235.5s)]
*  parole. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=241.86s)]
*  This was in July 2023 and they were granted humanitarian parole through the end of July [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=243.3s)]
*  of this year but the current administration canceled their humanitarian parole without [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=248.78s)]
*  notice and without reason in April of this year. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=254.86s)]
*  How was that communicated? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=259.82s)]
*  Through email. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=263.09999999999997s)]
*  Through email. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  Like you're out. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=266.21999999999997s)]
*  The family received a series of emails saying we have revoked your humanitarian parole [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=267.21999999999997s)]
*  and canceled your work permits. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=274.86s)]
*  You are required to leave the country immediately and if you don't we will look for you and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=276.8s)]
*  we will find you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=281.18s)]
*  You might be aware that many people across the United States have received this notice [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=283.12s)]
*  including an attorney on my team who was born in the United States and so you know they [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=287.82000000000005s)]
*  have been sending these notices to folks indiscriminately but this particular notice does mention humanitarian [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=293.74s)]
*  parole so they were aware that this family was here with humanitarian parole and humanitarian [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=301.02000000000004s)]
*  needs and nonetheless revoke their status. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  What is the next step for this family? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=313.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, we are doing our best to try to get the government to reverse this decision and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=317.58s)]
*  reinstate their humanitarian parole as well as extend it beyond July. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=322.97999999999996s)]
*  We have been trying to get the attention of the immigration service. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=328.5s)]
*  We are also exploring additional remedies in court. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=332.3s)]
*  Well, I would just say for anyone watching whatever your views are on immigration, the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=335.18s)]
*  border, etc. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  This seems like a pretty easy and straightforward case for Sofia to stay here and keep getting [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=342.34s)]
*  the care she needs wherever you come down on anything else. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=347.06s)]
*  Gina Amato, Lowe, thank you so much for making time for us and I appreciate it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLBPowZ4p0&t=350.94s)]
