Video Description: House Republicans just managed to pass its jam-packed, multi trillion-dollar spending bill to fund Donald Trump’s second-term agenda. It includes major cuts and changes to Medicaid and SNAP in order to deliver large tax cuts to the wealthy. “It is a piece of garbage,” former Democratic Senator Jon Tester of Montana told Ali Velshi. Tester says, like Trump’s tariffs, it will hurt farmers and worsen pre-existing problems in rural America, which could lead to “an even bigger mass exodus” of people out of those areas. “It doesn’t deal with the issues,” he says. “It puts a band aid over the issues in production and agriculture, just like it puts a band aid over our national debt.”

# ‘A piece of garbage’: Fmr. Sen. Jon Tester says GOP bill is anti-farmer and hurts rural America
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA)
*  Republicans in the House of Representatives achieved their goal of passing Donald Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=0.0s)]
*  jam-packed multi-trillion dollar spending package this week ahead of their self-imposed deadline [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=4.64s)]
*  of Memorial Day weekend. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=9.36s)]
*  The work's not nearly done. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=11.08s)]
*  There are plenty of hurdles ahead, including getting it through the Senate. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  But Trump's big, beautiful bill, which is what it's really called, is revealing a key [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  piece of a broader second-term economic policy agenda that's objectively bad for working [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=19.0s)]
*  Americans and particularly for some of Trump's most loyal voting blocs, like rural Americans [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=24.94s)]
*  and farmers. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=30.220000000000002s)]
*  For one thing, it contains one of the largest cuts ever to Medicaid, the federal health [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=31.46s)]
*  care program for low-income individuals with people and people with disabilities. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that the current version of the bill [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=39.82s)]
*  could lead to upward of $700 billion in Medicaid cuts. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  It also estimates that over the next 10 years, 8.6 million people could lose health care [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=48.96s)]
*  coverage as a result of these changes, including the implementation of stricter work requirements. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=54.14s)]
*  But it's not just about those initial numbers. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=58.34s)]
*  There are knock-on effects to stripping millions of people's health care coverage. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=60.62s)]
*  Medicaid funding cuts on this scale will likely negatively affect rural hospitals, which are [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=64.34s)]
*  more likely to rely on government health care spending. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=68.44s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  Many of those rural hospitals are already in dire financial straits. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  According to a recent report by the Center for Health Care Quality and Payment Reform, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=77.53999999999999s)]
*  more than 700 rural hospitals, one-third of all rural hospitals in the country, are at [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=81.46s)]
*  risk of closing because of serious financial problems that they are experiencing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  Over 300 of these rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closing because of the severity of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  their financial problems. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=95.86s)]
*  The Republicans' Medicaid cuts would undoubtedly add to those problems. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=98.18s)]
*  And if those hospitals are forced to close, it could cause a rural unemployment crisis [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=101.58s)]
*  because of hospitals' key role as employers. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=106.64s)]
*  The Trump spending bill also calls for major cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=110.48s)]
*  Program, or SNAP, which is the federal food aid program for low-income Americans. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  The bill cuts SNAP's funding by about $290 billion, in addition to other changes that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=119.68s)]
*  could lead to 3.2 million people getting kicked off the program, according to the CBO. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=124.48s)]
*  But SNAP doesn't just keep millions of Americans from going hungry. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=129.4s)]
*  It benefits farmers, too. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  The program boosts the agricultural industry by increasing demand for domestically grown [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=134.84s)]
*  which helps to create and maintain jobs in the rural economy of field workers, farm hands, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=139.86s)]
*  grocers and truck drivers, and so on. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=144.86s)]
*  These are all people and jobs that have a lot at stake if SNAP is cut. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=146.74s)]
*  It would also make farmers more dependent on government subsidies rather than sustaining [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=150.70000000000002s)]
*  their own business. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=154.70000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, I haven't even mentioned tariffs yet. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  President Trump just said yesterday that he's imposing a 50 percent tariff on all imports [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=158.58s)]
*  from the European Union starting June 1st, which could worsen America's trade war with [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=162.66000000000003s)]
*  the EU, which was previously announced and then suspended. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=166.98s)]
*  The EU had already put retaliatory tariffs on U.S. corn and soybean imports. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=170.54s)]
*  As one executive for an export trade group for farmers explained to CNBC recently, Trump's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=175.44s)]
*  tariffs aren't just the prelude to a bigger problem. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=180.38s)]
*  It's already a full-blown crisis. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=183.82s)]
*  After a break, I'm going to talk about this with the former Democratic Senator John Tester, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=186.56s)]
*  who happens to be a lifelong farmer. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=190.26s)]
*  Before the break, I told you about how Trump's economic policies are particularly hurting [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=194.7s)]
*  America's farmers. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  The former Democratic Senator John Tester of Montana knows firsthand what working Americans [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=198.73999999999998s)]
*  like farmers are up against because for the last 50 years, he's been farming the same [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=203.33999999999997s)]
*  land that his grandparents homesteaded in Montana. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=207.6s)]
*  I spoke to Tester earlier this morning. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=210.61999999999998s)]
*  Here's our discussion. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  Senator, it's good to see you again. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  Great to be here with you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=217.57999999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  Look, Elliot, I think you've laid it out very, very well. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  The only thing I would add to the healthcare discussion is that if these hospitals close [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=221.58s)]
*  in rural America, that means you've got to drive long distances to get your healthcare. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=230.02s)]
*  That means you're not going to be able to live in rural America. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=233.78s)]
*  It will further deplete the population of rural America. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=237.22000000000003s)]
*  You'll see even a bigger mass exodus. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=240.46s)]
*  This is bad on so many fronts. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  I'd say if you're over the age of 50, if you don't have access to healthcare, you've got [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=247.5s)]
*  to move somewhere where you can get access to healthcare. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=251.38s)]
*  If these hospitals close, that access closes too. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=253.74s)]
*  Yes, remember, because doctors and nurses and EMTs are in short supply all over the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=256.54s)]
*  country, they'll leave. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=260.58s)]
*  They'll get jobs somewhere else. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=261.98s)]
*  You'll hollow out that base. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=264.02s)]
*  You'll hollow out the base of people who spend their money in the community. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=265.3s)]
*  Then there's this problem that you may have never touched Medicaid in your life, but if [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=267.98s)]
*  the hospital and the healthcare disappears, you're just going to have to move to follow [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=271.26s)]
*  it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=274.62s)]
*  This is a very important point for people who are not on Medicaid, that Medicaid losses [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=275.66s)]
*  affect you. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=278.98s)]
*  Let's talk about farming for a second. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=279.98s)]
*  The trade war, and we can go back to 2018 and remember when this happened with the Chinese [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=282.74s)]
*  and then they stopped buying a lot of American products like soybeans. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=286.54s)]
*  This is a big, big issue. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=291.62s)]
*  America is a net exporter of food. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=294.9s)]
*  Donald Trump's obsessed with trade deficits. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=298.26s)]
*  We do not have a trade deficit in agriculture. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=300.04s)]
*  We really do feed a lot of the world. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=302.86s)]
*  We buy our stuff. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=304.5s)]
*  This is a very dangerous thing to mess with. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=305.78000000000003s)]
*  We raise more food than what this country eats, so those foreign markets are really, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=308.22s)]
*  really, really important. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=315.7s)]
*  If the president continues with what he's doing in this tariff, this trade war game [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=316.70000000000005s)]
*  that he's playing, we'll lose those markets. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=324.94s)]
*  I think we've lost some of them already. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=327.14s)]
*  We lose those markets. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=330.22s)]
*  That affects the price at the farm gate. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=331.22s)]
*  What turns around is that we have to depend upon the taxpayer for subsidies to make the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  books balance. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=340.09999999999997s)]
*  It's just wrong on all sorts of fronts. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=341.09999999999997s)]
*  Instead of dealing with the issue, and there's a lot of issues in production agriculture [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=344.5s)]
*  right now, whether it's a consolidated marketplace with not a lot of folks that are in the buying [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=347.9s)]
*  end of things, so you don't have the kind of competition you need in your marketplace, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=355.34s)]
*  or whether it's a trade war that's going to affect our foreign markets, it has negative [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  impacts all the way around. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=365.58000000000004s)]
*  I will tell you this. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=367.34000000000003s)]
*  This reconciliation bill that the House just passed has a kind of a farm bill in it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  It doesn't deal with the issues. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=374.94s)]
*  It puts a band-aid over the issues in production agriculture, just like it puts a band-aid [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=376.34000000000003s)]
*  over our national debt, by the way, by increasing our national debt while cutting services like [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=381.78000000000003s)]
*  Medicaid and SNAP and other things that you've talked about. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=386.34000000000003s)]
*  I hope the Senate takes a look at this bill for what it is, because it is a piece of garbage. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=390.46000000000004s)]
*  Rework it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=397.74s)]
*  Make it work for America. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=398.74s)]
*  It's going to have some trouble in the Senate. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=399.74s)]
*  Fortunately, there are some people who live in the world of agriculture, at least are [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=402.54s)]
*  exposed to the world of agriculture in the Senate. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=405.54s)]
*  You mentioned the farm bill. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=407.90000000000003s)]
*  A lot of people don't pay attention to the farm bill, but that's actually where SNAP [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=409.26000000000005s)]
*  is funded. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=412.46000000000004s)]
*  Even the USAID funding, which again, a lot of Americans don't encounter, they don't know [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=413.46000000000004s)]
*  what it's for. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=417.46s)]
*  A lot of that food is provided by America's farms. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=418.46s)]
*  In the last 200, 120 days or whatever, however many days Donald Trump's been the president, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=422.14s)]
*  somebody can give me a proper count. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=426.9s)]
*  We have done a lot of things that cause the price of food by an American farmer to either [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=429.2s)]
*  go down or the costs to increase. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=435.21999999999997s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=437.97999999999996s)]
*  There is no doubt with the tariff situation the way it is right now that it's going to [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=441.06s)]
*  affect the markets in a negative way. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=447.82s)]
*  Like I said before, what I think this administration expects to do is just cut taxpayer checks [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=449.78000000000003s)]
*  to the farmers to keep them in business, which by the way, will be necessary if the markets [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=456.94s)]
*  are destroyed. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=461.3s)]
*  Ironically, farmers responded well to that in 2019. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=462.3s)]
*  They feel like Donald Trump saved them from a problem that Donald Trump created. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=467.54s)]
*  Well, ultimately in the end, I think most farmers want us to get their check from the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=472.26000000000005s)]
*  marketplace. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=478.58000000000004s)]
*  I will tell you this, as my folks told me when we took the farm over nearly 50 years [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=480.06s)]
*  ago, you never want to depend upon the government because if you do, it can be taken away in [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=484.34000000000003s)]
*  any moment in time. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=490.02000000000004s)]
*  Depend on the marketplace. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=491.98s)]
*  So let's do things to make that marketplace more competitive by putting a competition [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=493.42s)]
*  title in our farm bill, which enforces the antitrust laws that are already on the books [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=497.94s)]
*  and put some teeth into them. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=502.70000000000005s)]
*  We'll get better prices at the farm gate, less ability to have to depend upon the American [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=504.34000000000003s)]
*  taxpayer to make our books balanced. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=512.1s)]
*  And fundamentally, if we get a program like that, it will put more people back into rural [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=514.58s)]
*  America. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=519.0600000000001s)]
*  I think agriculture a heck of a lot more fun because it'll be profitable. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=520.14s)]
*  I think it's a great idea. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=524.3s)]
*  It's a concept we should discuss a lot more. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=525.9799999999999s)]
*  And I'd love to have you back on the show to talk about that. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=528.3399999999999s)]
*  Senator, good to see you as always. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=530.9s)]
*  The former Democratic Senator of Montana, John Tester, who is also a working farmer. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bfIOqASpgA&t=532.3s)]
