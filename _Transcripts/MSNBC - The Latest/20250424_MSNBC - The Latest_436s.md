# 'Pay to play': Trump meme coin surges 50% after President offers private dinner to top investors
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY)
*  You know we like to ask the question on this show, is the White House for sale? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=0.0s)]
*  I want you to take a look at this. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=7.32s)]
*  Trump's meme coin surged 50% yesterday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=9.24s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=12.32s)]
*  Well, the president offered to host its top holders for a private dinner in Washington. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=13.32s)]
*  An online announcement teased it as, quote, the most exclusive invitation in the world [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=18.28s)]
*  and that the invitation came with very clear instructions. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=23.92s)]
*  From now until mid-May, supporters are encouraged to, quote, hold as much Trump coin as they [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=27.28s)]
*  can. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=32.72s)]
*  The more they hold and the longer they hold it, the higher their ranking and the better [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=33.72s)]
*  their chances of meeting the president himself. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=38.32s)]
*  The dinner also includes a special reception for the top 25 wallets. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=41.32s)]
*  That basically means holders. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  And the price spike that followed that announcement now brings the value of Trump's coin in circulation [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=47.56s)]
*  to $2.7 billion. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=53.84s)]
*  Former National Economic Council Deputy Director Bharat Ramamurthy joins the conversation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=57.28s)]
*  Neil is still with us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  Bharat, have you ever seen anything like this ever? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=62.6s)]
*  And we have to remind our audience, this is just Trump's meme coin, which even on its [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=66.0s)]
*  information about it doesn't say this is an investment opportunity. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=72.2s)]
*  This is like a super fan medallion coin. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=75.36s)]
*  You're not even buying Bitcoin here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=78.72s)]
*  There is no underlying value except your love and adoration of the president. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=80.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's straightforward pay to play. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=83.76s)]
*  You are putting money directly into the president's pocket in exchange for access to the president. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=86.76s)]
*  And I think it's important to overlay this with the tariff war that's going on right [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  Because what is the most important thing you can get if you are a business person? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  It's direct access to the president. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=100.48s)]
*  Because if you can get an exemption from the tariffs for a country that you import from [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=102.36000000000001s)]
*  or a particular category of goods that your business relies upon, that's worth millions, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=106.6s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars potentially. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=110.6s)]
*  So that's what it is, an exchange of money for access to the president to potentially [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  get a favor that's worth potentially hundreds of millions of dollars to you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=116.28s)]
*  But that's why this is so interesting to me, because these people who are going to the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=119.32s)]
*  dinner, these are just like super fans going to a music festival paying for a photo op. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=122.8s)]
*  But if this president is clearly laying out that this is his approach to access, how deep [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=128.72s)]
*  and dangerous can it be when it comes to high rollers with a lot of money who need big stuff? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=134.76s)]
*  Yeah, and I would draw a distinction between, there have been plenty of scandals over the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  years about campaign finance and mega donors and soft money, some stuff that looks pretty [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=143.16s)]
*  shady. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=147.92s)]
*  But that money does have to go to the campaign fund or to independent expenditures, not to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=148.92s)]
*  the candidate themselves. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  It's not like income to the person running for office who maybe did something a little [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  shady. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=158.72s)]
*  This is potentially income that the president himself can cash in through this asset that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=159.72s)]
*  he created. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=163.44s)]
*  It's a new world in terms of the ethics and any kind of sense of what's legal and what's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=164.56s)]
*  allowed in U.S. government. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=170.2s)]
*  Have you ever seen anything like this? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=172.28s)]
*  And just take yourself back to the scrutiny you were under when you were on the, not even, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=174.04s)]
*  just stand alone. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=179.16s)]
*  Have we ever seen anything like this? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=180.2s)]
*  And is there a single rule against it? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=181.52s)]
*  Because it doesn't feel like there is. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=183.28s)]
*  Even where they're hosting it, it's not in the White House, but it's at a Trump club. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  So the club is even going to get paid to host the event. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=189.1s)]
*  Exactly, right. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=191.96s)]
*  And look, what's happened over the last decade or so is that the Supreme Court has really [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=193.96s)]
*  weakened the rules on corruption and made it very hard to bring these types of cases. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=198.28s)]
*  And so politicians have taken advantage of it, none more so than Trump. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  And it makes me think back to the ethics rules that we tried to follow when I was in the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  White House about if somebody gave me a token, you know, something that was worth maybe $25, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  I had to report it to the White House office, make sure that it was filed, and it didn't [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=216.16s)]
*  take it home personally. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=220.68s)]
*  Here's the president potentially making hundreds of millions of dollars based on a single announcement [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=221.68s)]
*  on a single dinner. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=226.84s)]
*  So fools like me actually thought progress was being made to address congressional stock [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=228.08s)]
*  trading, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=233.52s)]
*  There was so many people who were unhappy the way Nancy Pelosi was never bringing it [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=234.52s)]
*  to a vote, given how much her husband invested. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=238.44s)]
*  It was lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=240.72s)]
*  There was talk at some point of closing the carried interest loophole that private equity [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  giants benefit from. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=247.70000000000002s)]
*  Given where we are and given how this White House rolls, is there any chance any of those [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=250.18s)]
*  things are going to happen at least in the next three years? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  I think in this Congress with this president, no. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=257.38s)]
*  But I do think, you know, you look around, as you say, there are issues not just with [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=260.22s)]
*  this president, this administration, things that have been building for a long time of, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=265.18s)]
*  you know, why are people able to get rich while doing public service? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=268.3s)]
*  Is that how we want society to run? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  Should there be some more limitations to keep that from happening? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  I think that's—that dam might break. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=276.06s)]
*  But as you say, I'm not sure that's going to happen in the next couple of years. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=278.70000000000005s)]
*  OK, but we think back to the early COVID days, and we saw members of Congress on both sides [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=281.90000000000003s)]
*  of the aisle suddenly trade all these stocks that were directly COVID-related, and clearly [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=286.86s)]
*  they had more information than the rest of us, and the world was outraged. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=290.94000000000005s)]
*  Now here we have a White House that makes policy hints and announcements on trade every [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=294.38000000000005s)]
*  single day that cause huge spikes in volatility. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=300.22s)]
*  They could be making a killing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=303.34000000000003s)]
*  Today, Charlie Gasparino from Fox said people inside this White House could be tipping [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=304.65999999999997s)]
*  off their Wall Street friends about a potential trade deal with India. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  That could be blatant insider trading. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=313.3s)]
*  Does no one care? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=315.34s)]
*  I care. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=316.34s)]
*  I mean, I think it's horrible. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=317.34s)]
*  And it's not just that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=318.34s)]
*  It's, you know, Secretary Besson was at a private event for JPMorgan, high net worth [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=320.34s)]
*  investors, and he was telling them all about their game plan for China and their prospects [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=325.18s)]
*  for a deal. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  Again, that's massively important market-moving information that's being told— [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=330.65999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=334.7s)]
*  And so if you get ahead of that before it becomes public, you can make huge sums of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=335.7s)]
*  money because you had access to the right types of people. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=338.94s)]
*  It's a real problem, and I think that it's endemic across this administration. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=342.41999999999996s)]
*  As Neal was saying, my hope is that it leads to a backlash where we start to really tighten [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=347.53999999999996s)]
*  up these rules going forward, not just on congressional stock trading, on these types [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=351.53999999999996s)]
*  of subtle hints that you give to people, to high net worth investors, that the Main Street [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=354.94s)]
*  doesn't get. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  Todd, you know, as you talk about insider trading, if you're a CFO who gives your [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=361.3s)]
*  buddy on the golf course a tip about a deal you're about to do, and he buys and trades [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  on it and makes money, you both go to jail. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=368.58000000000004s)]
*  And yet somehow we've cut out this exception for public employees and public life that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=371.74s)]
*  doesn't really make sense from first principles. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=376.46000000000004s)]
*  And everything—are we going to look back on what's happened in the last two weeks? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=379.06s)]
*  And it might smell bad, but nothing's going to be illegal? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=382.74s)]
*  Two weeks? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=386.14000000000004s)]
*  No, yeah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=387.14000000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=388.14000000000004s)]
*  The people who should be overseeing all this stuff is the SEC, and Trump's appointee [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=389.46s)]
*  to the SEC has basically announced a very hands-off approach to this type of enforcement [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=393.86s)]
*  action. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=398.06s)]
*  So it all fits together. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeVA6aQFfY&t=399.06s)]
