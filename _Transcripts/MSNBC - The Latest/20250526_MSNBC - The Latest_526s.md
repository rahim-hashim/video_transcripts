# 'Gone absolutely CRAZY!': Trump lashes out at Putin after massive attack on Ukraine
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU)
*  A shift in tone from President Trump toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=0.0s)]
*  But does it mean a change in action? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=4.2s)]
*  Trump lashing out at Putin after a weekend that saw the largest Russian drone and missile [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=6.4s)]
*  strike on Ukraine since the war began. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=10.08s)]
*  More than a dozen people killed in those strikes, with many more injured across Ukraine. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=12.6s)]
*  The president saying on social media that Putin had gone absolutely crazy, in his words, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=17.28s)]
*  and making these comments last night. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=21.72s)]
*  I'm not happy with what Putin's doing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=25.88s)]
*  He's killing a lot of people and I don't know what the hell happened to Putin. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=28.2s)]
*  I've known him a long time, always gotten along with him, but he's sending rockets into [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  cities and killing people and I don't like it at all. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=36.48s)]
*  The Kremlin's response this morning that the negotiations process has heightened everyone's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=42.2s)]
*  emotions, leading to quote, emotional overload from Trump. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=46.36s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News international correspondent, Raf Sanchez and former CIA officer Mark Polymeropoulos, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=50.6s)]
*  who's now an MSNBC national security and intelligence analyst. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=56.48s)]
*  Raf, first to you, what does this mean for ceasefire negotiations? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  So Ali, as you know better than most, President Trump's efforts to get a ceasefire in Ukraine [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=64.64s)]
*  have been a real roller coaster. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=68.56s)]
*  Some days he says a peace deal is right around the corner. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  Other days he is publicly frustrated with Vladimir Putin and this is one of those days. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=74.4s)]
*  This is some of the strongest criticism he has made yet of the Russian leader. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=78.72s)]
*  But so far his angry words have not been backed up with actions. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=83.68s)]
*  After a weekend of massive and deadly Russian strikes on Ukraine, President Trump overnight [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=91.28s)]
*  lashing out at Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  I'm not happy with what Putin's doing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  He's killing a lot of people and I don't know what the hell happened to Putin. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=100.72s)]
*  We're in the middle of talking and he's shooting rockets into Kiev and other cities. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  I don't like it at all. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=108.2s)]
*  Adding in a Truth Social post, Putin has gone absolutely crazy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=109.84s)]
*  It's a major shift from last week when the leaders held a two-hour phone call. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  Trump calling it an excellent discussion, claiming peace negotiations would begin immediately. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=119.44s)]
*  But instead Russia stepping up its attacks and unleashing what Ukraine says are some [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=126.08s)]
*  of the largest bombardments of the entire war, with more than 700 missiles and drones [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=130.76s)]
*  targeting dozens of cities, including Kiev, where spotlights comb the sky for incoming [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=136.64s)]
*  attacks. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=143.27999999999997s)]
*  At least 18 civilians were killed, including three children, Ukrainian officials say. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  President Volodymyr Zelensky calling on the U.S. to impose sanctions on Russia, saying [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  silence of America, silence of others around the world only encourages Putin. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=155.04s)]
*  But Trump refusing to commit to sanctions. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=160.44s)]
*  And hitting back at Zelensky, posting overnight, everything out of his mouth causes problems. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=164.4s)]
*  I don't like it and it better stop. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=169.68s)]
*  One glimmer of hope, Russia and Ukraine completing the largest prisoner swap of the war, releasing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=173.0s)]
*  a thousand POWs each. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  We haven't had chocolate for three years, this Ukrainian soldier says, wrapped in the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=182.88s)]
*  flag they fought for and happy to be home. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=187.68s)]
*  We are hearing from the Kremlin today that Putin is grateful to President Trump for his [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=193.2s)]
*  ceasefire efforts, but also suggesting that the president may be suffering from an emotional [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=198.26s)]
*  overload. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=204.84s)]
*  We will see how well that goes down in the Oval Office. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=205.84s)]
*  The Kremlin is also pointing out that Ukraine is continuing drone attacks on Russia. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  That's true, but Russia's attacks are far larger and they are killing many more civilians. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=213.6s)]
*  Ali. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=218.6s)]
*  Thank you, as always. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=219.6s)]
*  Now, Mark, I cannot imagine that these comments from Putin are going to land well with President [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=221.68s)]
*  Trump, who, while he has had moments of tough talk against the Russian president, has not [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=226.96s)]
*  actually changed his posture fundamentally. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=231.64s)]
*  Do you think that this is a moment where we could see a change impact? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=234.56s)]
*  Maybe it's sanctions, maybe it's something else. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=238.28s)]
*  Well, Ali, I think it's always been the contention that the more that Vladimir Putin humiliates [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump, perhaps that's going to change some type of U.S. behavior, because ultimately [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=247.32s)]
*  now both the Trump administration and even the GOP, including some of the kind of the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=251.84s)]
*  Russia hawks, those who do want to see increased activity against the Russians, they are now [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=256.92s)]
*  complicit in this U.S. inaction. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  So when is there ever a better time for things such as this sanctions package that Senator [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=264.52s)]
*  Graham has put together that would be, you know, could be quite useful in really crippling [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=269.84s)]
*  the Russian economy? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=275.64s)]
*  And then, of course, there's the notion of provision of additional aid to Ukraine, whether [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=276.96s)]
*  the U.S. would do that, whether it would allow our European partners to do so as well. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=281.84s)]
*  And I will note that there is a posting that the German chancellor, Merz, just put out [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=286.96s)]
*  almost insinuating that Germany is ready to provide these Taurus missiles to Ukraine. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=293.64s)]
*  And Merz then said there would not be any restrictions on use by Ukraine inside of Russia. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=299.08s)]
*  So perhaps the Europeans are stepping up. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=305.36s)]
*  But the bottom line is, at this point, after this horrible several days in Ukraine, the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=307.12s)]
*  international community, who has been relatively impotent, powerless on this, really does have [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=312.16s)]
*  to step up. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=316.52s)]
*  Is it going to be Trump? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=317.52s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=318.52s)]
*  Is it going to be the Europeans? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=319.52s)]
*  Perhaps. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=320.52s)]
*  But something has to be done. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=321.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think that role of the United States and the who knows posture that you're speaking [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=322.52s)]
*  to right there is one that you and I have talked about a lot on my show way too early. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=326.72s)]
*  We were talking about it this morning on Morning Joe. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=330.6s)]
*  And certainly it lands us right here with the idea of what would Putin's strategy be [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=333.32000000000005s)]
*  if he were to lose this friendly ear from Trump, which you don't go about saying that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  a president has emotional overload in his responses if you're not trying to at least [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=342.68s)]
*  shake the foundation of that relationship? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, I think Vladimir Putin, as a former Russian intelligence officer, has a pretty [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=348.88000000000005s)]
*  good idea of what makes Trump tick. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  So he can kind of needle Trump here and there. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=357.72s)]
*  But then he might follow it up with another friendly phone call. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=360.96s)]
*  I think Putin certainly calibrates everything that he does, knowing full well that just [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=363.88s)]
*  prolonging these negotiations ultimately is going to be good for him, never allowing [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=369.44s)]
*  Trump to feel so embarrassed, perhaps, that he would turn on the spigot again of weapons [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=374.48s)]
*  to Ukraine, because I think Vladimir Putin really understands that Trump at most perhaps [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=381.48s)]
*  is disinterested, but is never going to side with the Ukrainians. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=388.08s)]
*  The Kremlin has always been very good at assessing how Donald Trump ticks, and I would imagine [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=393.28s)]
*  that to continue. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=397.76s)]
*  Yeah, and you and I have talked about the fact that it's long seen as Putin just trying [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=398.76s)]
*  to buy himself time to regroup while he also continues that aggressive posture that we've [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=403.24s)]
*  seen on the ground in Ukraine, especially over the last 48 and 72 hours. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=407.79999999999995s)]
*  But before I let you go, I want to just shift our regional focus a little bit, because U.S. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=412.65999999999997s)]
*  law enforcement officials arrested a dual American-German citizen on Sunday after an [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=416.76s)]
*  alleged plot to firebomb a U.S. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  embassy office in Israel. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=423.48s)]
*  Mark, how concerned are you about these developments and where does an investigation like that [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=425.24s)]
*  now go? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=429.12s)]
*  Well, I think this certainly is a sign of what has always been the case, excellent cooperation [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=430.88s)]
*  between the security services in Israel and in the United States. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=435.24s)]
*  These kind of attacks, in essence, a lone wolf. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=439.56s)]
*  This is an individual. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=442.16s)]
*  A bit odd that he was both a U.S. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=443.6s)]
*  and German citizen, but he was going to, in essence, conduct an arson attack using Molotov [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=445.6s)]
*  cocktails at the U.S. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=450.64s)]
*  Embassy branch office in Tel Aviv, formerly the embassy. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank goodness it was stopped. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=456.24s)]
*  But these, of course, are things that one has to consider as the tensions in the region [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=458.16s)]
*  continue to amount. And at the end of the day, we still don't have any resolution to the war [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=463.04s)]
*  in Gaza, which, of course, is the source of so much frustration. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=467.48s)]
*  There's some competing peace proposals out there now, lots of things happening between [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=471.36s)]
*  what the Trump administration seems to want that the war to end. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=476.64000000000004s)]
*  Administration Bibi Netanyahu is saying no. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=479.68s)]
*  The next days ahead are going to be very telling. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=482.16s)]
*  Yeah. And Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is actually in Israel [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=484.56s)]
*  right now. She was saying on another network this morning that she's had some tough and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=488.84000000000003s)]
*  honest candid conversations with top Israeli officials. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IOQJbLw_TU&t=492.6s)]
