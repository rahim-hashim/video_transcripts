# ‘A horror show’: Analyst bashes Trump administration over Newark mayor’s ICE arrest
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg)
*  And joining us now, we've got Michael Hardaway, former communications director for Congressman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=0.0s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries and Brendan Buck, MSNBC political analyst and former press secretary to House [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=4.4s)]
*  Speaker John Boehner. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=9.64s)]
*  Michael, I want to go back to some of those recent ICE arrests. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=10.64s)]
*  The mayor of Newark was detained for several hours for what they're calling trespassing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=14.44s)]
*  at this new federal immigration detention center. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=18.68s)]
*  There was also this arrest of a woman in Massachusetts where the agents pinned her teenage daughter [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=21.2s)]
*  to the ground during that, you know, I don't know if we would call them arrests or whatever [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  we're calling them, picking her up. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=29.4s)]
*  How do most Americans feel about these incidents in the context of President Trump's immigration [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=31.16s)]
*  agenda? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=36.56s)]
*  This is a horror show. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=37.56s)]
*  Now, remember, this is a man who promised during his campaign to deport 12 million people. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=39.28s)]
*  And so I don't know if their plan to deport all of these people is to one by one, rip [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  them out of the arms of their parents and their children. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=50.32s)]
*  I don't think that's going to work. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=53.32s)]
*  What needs to actually happen is a comprehensive immigration bill similar to a bipartisan effort [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=54.72s)]
*  that Donald Trump killed last year. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=60.28s)]
*  I think that would address this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=62.16s)]
*  I think these one by ones and arresting mayors, obviously, who have done nothing and arresting [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=63.72s)]
*  others makes absolutely no sense. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=68.52s)]
*  But it's really representative of Donald Trump's strategy, which is to operate this country [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  the same way he did Trump's stakes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=75.8s)]
*  And that didn't turn out well. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=77.52s)]
*  And Brendan, beyond that, I'm wondering what you make of Trump adviser Stephen Miller saying [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=80.0s)]
*  they're looking at suspending habeas corpus, which would deny any due process for migrants. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=83.44s)]
*  You know, you're seeing some pushback on that even from some very unlikely places. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=89.12s)]
*  Joe Rogan among them. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=92.8s)]
*  Could the president be losing support on the immigration front if people believe he's overreaching [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=94.12s)]
*  here? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=98.76s)]
*  Yeah, potentially. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  Look, they're not going to let something like the Constitution get in the way of their immigration [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=100.76s)]
*  policy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=106.72s)]
*  And I think we should appreciate that there are people in the White House, including the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=107.72s)]
*  president, who have very extreme views on what they should be doing to reduce the population [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=111.44000000000001s)]
*  of immigrants in this country that is well outside of the mainstream. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=117.84s)]
*  I think there is mainstream support for things like border security and deporting people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  who shouldn't be here when they've certainly broken laws. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  And they talk about violent criminals. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=128.68s)]
*  But obviously, they're going well beyond that in a way that is instilling a lot of fear. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=130.08s)]
*  Now, they are basing all of this idea on the fact that the Constitution talks about you [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=135.4s)]
*  can suspend habeas corpus if the country is under invasion and they're trying to claim [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=140.28s)]
*  that the immigration situation we have in here is akin to an invasion. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=143.8s)]
*  And courts have time and time again ruled that that just doesn't hold up and is not [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=148.56s)]
*  what's actually going on here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=154.36s)]
*  And so I imagine this will be defeated. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=155.8s)]
*  What's most shocking to me is, look, habeas corpus has been suspended a few times in our [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=158.56s)]
*  nation's history, but it is viewed as perhaps some of the most shameful episodes in our [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=163.12s)]
*  history. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=167.28s)]
*  I don't appreciate that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=168.28s)]
*  And they're willing to go down that road to pursue this. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=169.28s)]
*  It tells me they certainly don't respect our people's rights and our Constitution and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  are a lot, I should say, out of the mainstream of what people are looking for. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE7mns50Fg&t=177.72s)]
