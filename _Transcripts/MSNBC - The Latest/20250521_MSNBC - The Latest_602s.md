# Pressure Trump is putting on GOP over Medicaid cuts is 'surprising': Forward Party CEO
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM)
*  agenda here. Joining us now is NBC's Chief Capitol Hill correspondent Ryan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=0.0s)]
*  Nobles and CEO of the Forward Party and former regional finance director for the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=4.68s)]
*  Romney campaign, Lindsey Drath. Let's start on Capitol Hill with Ryan. You've [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  been monitoring the hours-long markups, which started literally in the middle of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=13.08s)]
*  the night. The House Freedom Caucus just made a major announcement. What did we [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=18.12s)]
*  hear? Well, they said they're getting closer to voting yes, Ana, but they're [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=21.96s)]
*  not there quite yet. The House Freedom Caucus is, of course, one of two [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=27.24s)]
*  different factions that are a significant number of holdouts that are [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=31.56s)]
*  currently no on the bill, enough to kill the bill, who have been working with [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=36.68s)]
*  House leadership to try and get to a yes. And these discussions really began [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=40.68s)]
*  in earnest yesterday when President Trump came here to Capitol Hill and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  basically told these different factions to get off the sideline and get to a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=48.32s)]
*  place where they can get to a yes vote. Now, it wasn't just enough for Trump to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=51.76s)]
*  tell them to vote yes. They actually needed to see something tangible put on [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=56.68s)]
*  the table. These Freedom Caucus Republicans are looking for more cuts. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=60.24s)]
*  They're worried about the growing deficit. They want to see more efforts [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=64.44s)]
*  to try and rein in government spending to get to those deficit goals. But, of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=68.92s)]
*  course, the further that those cuts are extended, the risk then becomes that you [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=73.2s)]
*  lose moderates who could potentially vote no if the cuts specifically to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=78.64s)]
*  social programs like Medicaid are too much. So the news right now in the last [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=83.64s)]
*  five minutes or so is that the Freedom Caucus is getting closer. They believe [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=88.84s)]
*  that the negotiations are heading in the right direction, but they are skeptical [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=92.84s)]
*  that the vote could happen as soon as today because they believe that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=96.6s)]
*  something still need to change before they can get to a yes vote on it. And [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=99.92s)]
*  Ryan, this bill is over 1000 pages. It's 1116 pages to be exact. So give us the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=103.8s)]
*  Cliffs notes here. What are the biggest top lines, the things that will impact [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=112.16s)]
*  people's day to day lives for better or worse? Yeah, and you know, and the the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=115.96s)]
*  size of the bill is both the problem and it's also the benefit of this package. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=121.24s)]
*  What the White House and and what the House and Senate leadership are doing is [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  trying to leverage all these different issues against each other to try and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=130.76s)]
*  encourage people who want certain parts of the package to pass to vote yes. But [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=134.48s)]
*  then at the same time, because there are so many things in this bill, it's easy [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=138.36s)]
*  to find aspects of it to quibble with. But if you're somebody watching at home [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=142.88000000000002s)]
*  and wondering how this impacts you, the most obvious component of the bill that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=145.68s)]
*  could impact you are the extension of the Trump tax cuts. $4.5 trillion in tax [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=150.44000000000003s)]
*  cuts. If these tax cuts were to sunset, almost every American would face some [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=155.84s)]
*  sort of a tax increase. And so this is a very important part of the bill, but [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=160.68s)]
*  that also includes tax cuts for overtime. Tax on tips would be eliminated. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=164.6s)]
*  Also, tax on Social Security would also be eliminated. And then, of course, the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=169.88s)]
*  most controversial aspect of the bill are these cuts to Medicaid. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=174.0s)]
*  Republicans are pushing for work requirements for Medicaid recipients. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=178.68s)]
*  They also want to change the timeline in which people need to be renew their [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=182.72s)]
*  eligibility for Medicaid. And they also want to take a closer look at waste, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=186.2s)]
*  fraud and abuse and reining in what they say are people taking advantage of the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=191.56s)]
*  system. Now, Democrats have argued that that could potentially lead to the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=195.96s)]
*  cutting of benefits of anywhere between eight and 11 million Americans. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=200.08s)]
*  So that's the balance that they're trying to find as they push this massive [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  bill forward. So, Lindsay, the non congressional budget office or non [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=208.0s)]
*  partisan, I should say, congressional budget office reported just last week [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=212.88s)]
*  that over seven million people are going to lose health insurance because of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=216.32000000000002s)]
*  these Medicaid cuts that are in the initial bill that's been presented here. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=219.32s)]
*  Axios reported last month that Republicans own polling shows voters are [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=223.4s)]
*  opposed to reducing Medicaid spending to lower the deficit or lower the national [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  debt. What's the thinking here? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=232.92s)]
*  Well, I'm quite surprised that the president put the pressure that he did on [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=235.2s)]
*  a number of the members yesterday on the Hill because you're looking at members [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=239.88s)]
*  like Mike Lawler from New York, for example, who's holding strong on the salt [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=243.04s)]
*  deduction. The pathway to a House majority for the Republican Party goes [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=248.08s)]
*  through California and New York. They can't lose these members of Congress. So [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=253.36s)]
*  the pressure that the president is putting on them related to Medicaid and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=257.6s)]
*  some of these other issues is surprising to me. I don't understand what the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  thinking is. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=264.48s)]
*  And we have our Julie Serkin who's joining us right now. She was just at that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=265.48s)]
*  presser with the House Republican caucus. So I want to go to you, Julie, right now. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=269.48s)]
*  What just came out of that? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=272.88s)]
*  Well, a lot of question marks. We basically were in a room with a group of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=275.68s)]
*  House Freedom Caucus members who spent an hour in Speaker Johnson's office trying [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=279.6s)]
*  to haggle over these provisions of the bill since Johnson seemed to extend an [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=283.96s)]
*  olive branch to the Salters, those group of Republicans in blue states who want to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=288.08s)]
*  raise the cap on state and local income tax deduction. That, of course, does not [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=292.8s)]
*  bode well for conservative hardliners. To my right is actually Ralph Norman [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=297.0s)]
*  right now. Members of the House Freedom Caucus just going up and down the hallway [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  here in a couple of hours from now, though, they will head to the White House [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=305.4s)]
*  to meet with President Trump. Speaker Johnson, I'm told, will attend that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=308.84s)]
*  meeting as well as they try to get to yes on this provision. There's still a [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=312.2s)]
*  chance that they could vote on this bill later today. The House Freedom Caucus [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=316.96s)]
*  members led, of course, by Andy Harris, the chairman, said that they think [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  they're making progress. They don't see a reason to squeeze this bill in today. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=324.68s)]
*  There are still outlying issues. Apparently, according to them, the White [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  House presented them with another offer overnight, although a source tells me [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  that was less of what the White House wants to offer them, but more telling [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=336.24s)]
*  them if they can get the support for certain provisions, whether that's more [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  reforms to Medicaid, more reforms to when those clean energy tax credits phase [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  out, maybe some reforms again to the salt deduction that they would not stand [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=348.0s)]
*  in the way, which is notable but different from the White House saying you [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=352.32s)]
*  guys have free will over this bill, which of course we know they don't since [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=356.0s)]
*  President Trump came to the Hill earlier yesterday and told them to put their [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=359.16s)]
*  pens down on it. Okay, so more pressure from the White House, especially with [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=362.6s)]
*  these Freedom Caucus members expected to head to the White House later today. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=366.0s)]
*  Ryan, the CBO is also finding that this bill will boost the incomes of the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=371.12s)]
*  richest 10% while lowering the incomes of the lowest 10%. Republicans routinely [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=376.24s)]
*  trash the CBO's scoring and analysis, but people will undoubtedly notice when [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=382.72s)]
*  more money is taken out of their paychecks. Are there any Republicans [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  voicing concerns about that? Well, to your point, Ana, I think most Republicans are [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=391.48s)]
*  gonna just ignore the results of the Congressional Budget Office. They have, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=397.24s)]
*  for many years, believed that the CBO is not a reliable indicator of exactly how [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=401.36s)]
*  these bills manifest themselves, but if you look at the CBO's track record, you [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  know, in many instances, I mean, it's impossible to forecast the future with [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=411.68s)]
*  100% specificity, but they usually have a pretty accurate track record. And I [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=414.8s)]
*  think that's one of the big open questions that is a big difference [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  between how the White House views this package and how Congressional [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=423.08s)]
*  Republicans view this package. You know, President Trump has a deadline. He's [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=426.36s)]
*  gonna be leaving the White House in 2028. He just wants to get this package done [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=430.08s)]
*  immediately and isn't necessarily going to feel the impacts of the long term [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=435.48s)]
*  political consequences of this package five, 10 years down the road, where many [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=440.04s)]
*  of the decisions that are made here could manifest themselves. If you're a [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=444.84s)]
*  congressional Republican, especially somebody that's younger on their way up [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=448.04s)]
*  the chain, hoping to make a name for themselves in Congress, you're gonna be [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=452.28s)]
*  dealing with these real world impacts for the next two years in every single [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=456.16s)]
*  election cycle. So this is definitely something that they have to concern [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=459.8s)]
*  themselves with. And especially when you talk about trying to shrink the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=464.16s)]
*  deficit, you know, there are many House Republicans in particular who represent [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=467.28s)]
*  districts where they do not have a lot of wealthy people as their constituents. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=472.52s)]
*  And there are some congressional Republicans that have floated the idea [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=478.64s)]
*  of raising the rate on the top earners in this country as a way to help shrink [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=482.08s)]
*  that deficit and then not sacrifice Medicaid. It's so far been a no go with [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=486.26s)]
*  the rest of the Republican conference on. Here's another thing, Lindsay. This [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=490.4s)]
*  White House is pushing for Americans to have more babies. Well, another part of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=493.68s)]
*  this bill shows about two million people are going to lose the child tax credit, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=498.32s)]
*  among other things that might impact families. How does that square with [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=503.6s)]
*  Republicans claiming to be the Family Values Party? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=506.6s)]
*  The challenge that I'm seeing through this whole issue is a process one. Ryan [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=510.6s)]
*  referenced the pace at which we're trying to get this down to a vote and [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  get it out of the rules committee. I worked for Speaker Boehner and he had a [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=521.8399999999999s)]
*  mandatory wait period when a bill came out of the rules committee so that the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=526.0s)]
*  American people could see it. And as you said earlier, this is a 1000 page [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=530.76s)]
*  reconciliation bill, and it has things like the child tax credit and it really [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=534.88s)]
*  important things that impact American families. And American voters should have [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=538.88s)]
*  time to sit with this. They're trying to push it through for a vote before [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=542.8s)]
*  Memorial Day. Why do you think the pace is so important to them? Because the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=547.0s)]
*  president wants it on his desk. This is the president's big, beautiful bill, and [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=550.48s)]
*  he's asked Speaker Johnson to push this through. The Senate didn't want this. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=554.2s)]
*  They actually had two different versions of the bill that they had preferred. So [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=558.04s)]
*  I am hoping that by the time this lands with the Senate, we're gonna see a [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=561.24s)]
*  slower pace so that Americans can see what's inside it. Well, that's another [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=565.04s)]
*  conversation for another day, and that is the senators who are not along for [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=569.04s)]
*  the ride on this. We know that that's gonna face some hurdles once this [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=574.32s)]
*  legislation gets there. Ryan Nobles, Julie Serkin and Lindsay Draft. Thank you [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=577.96s)]
*  all. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF7egMCt9IM&t=581.84s)]
