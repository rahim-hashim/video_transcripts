# Hamas to release last American hostage, Edan Alexander
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps)
*  And our colleague, NBC's Matt Bradley, who's going to weigh in on this breaking news, again, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=0.0s)]
*  that the Israeli soldier, Edan Alexander, again a U.S. dual citizen, may be released [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=5.12s)]
*  forthcoming in negotiations to try to end the war between Hamas and Israel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=11.52s)]
*  Give me a sense of what you're hearing about this, Matt. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=17.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm hearing about it as much as everybody else. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=19.92s)]
*  I mean, the real issue here, as you mentioned, to try to end the war, we heard from Hamas [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=23.76s)]
*  themselves and Dr. Khalil El-Hayyeh, who has been making a lot of these announcements over [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=28.0s)]
*  the past year and a half. He is the head of Hamas' negotiating delegation. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=31.92s)]
*  He did say that this effort to release Edan Alexander, the last remaining American living [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  hostage still in the Gaza Strip, and again, he's a dual Israeli-American citizen, they said that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=41.84s)]
*  this statement, that the movement referring to Hamas affirms its readiness to immediately begin [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  intensive negotiations and exert serious efforts to reach a final agreement to end the war. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=52.48s)]
*  So as far as Hamas is concerned, this is an effort, a goodwill effort probably, to try to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  get to a point where they can actually reach a new sort of ceasefire. Remember, there was one [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=65.44s)]
*  that started in late January, it lasted for two months until March 18th, and that was when Israel [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=71.19999999999999s)]
*  decided to back out of the ceasefire, which had already extended beyond its deadline. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=76.64s)]
*  All negotiations to extend that ceasefire had been unsuccessful, so it looks as though Hamas [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=83.2s)]
*  is hoping that this effort, releasing this last American hostage, will pave the way for a renewed [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=88.64s)]
*  ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. Now, so far, all of these ceasefires, all of these negotiations have [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=97.2s)]
*  eluded any kind of accord that would bring some measure of peace to the Gaza Strip. This has been [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=102.0s)]
*  going on now for months, ever since March 18th, and for more than the past two months, Israel has [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=108.56s)]
*  blockaded the Gaza Strip in a full way. It has prevented any aid, and that means food, fresh water, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=114.72s)]
*  electricity, fuel, and medical aid, from getting into the Gaza Strip. So the population is really, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=121.52s)]
*  according to medical officials, international aid organizations, on the brink of famine, and we've [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=128.64s)]
*  seen this reported both from our teams on the ground and from several different advocacy [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=134.08s)]
*  organizations. So there really is a desperate need for the people of the Gaza Strip to try to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=139.28s)]
*  relieve that blockade. This effort, releasing this last American hostage, could be trying to assuage [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=145.6s)]
*  the population of the Gaza Strip, more than two million people, many of whom, Alex, by the way, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  have been protesting against Hamas' rule and against this continued war for the past several months. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBlcDC1gps&t=158.16s)]
