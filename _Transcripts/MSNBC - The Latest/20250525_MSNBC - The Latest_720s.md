Video Description: In recent years, the Supreme Court has overloaded its “shadow docket” with controversial cases that do not receive the same scrutiny and legal process as a traditional case in front of the court. NYU Law professor Melissa Murray says the courts’ use of the shadow docket has “raised a lot of questions about transparency.” Slate Senior Editor Dahlia Lithwick says that at a time when the Supreme Court struggles with legitimacy, the shadow docket is “the worst possible way to say [the Supreme Court] is a serious entity.”

# ‘Slot machine justice:’ The Supreme Court’s reliance on the emergency docket
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4)
*  Melissa, this is born of the idea that there's a lot of stuff is coming out of the Supreme Court these days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=0.0s)]
*  And those of us who don't study it as closely as the two of you assume that all things that start and end at the Supreme Court go through the same process. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=6.0s)]
*  That's not just not the case. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=13.0s)]
*  No, it's not. And you gave a really good explanation of that earlier, Ali. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=15.0s)]
*  This emergency docket or shadow docket is essentially a case management tool that the court uses in sort of interim measures in order to keep litigation moving. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=20.0s)]
*  But we've seen over the last couple of years in both the first Trump administration and in the Biden administration, the administration's going to the court through the shadow docket in order to get expedited relief for their policies. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=29.0s)]
*  Or in the case of some challengers to go to get relief from the administration's policy on the shadow docket. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=43.0s)]
*  The shadow docket has raised a lot of questions around transparency because, as you said, these are cases that typically do not come before the court with the benefit of full oral argument and briefing. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=49.0s)]
*  And they are often disposed of with very short cursory opinions that don't provide a lot of rationale. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=60.0s)]
*  And in fact, the court's decision last week on the question of the removal power, whether the president can summarily remove without cause members of independent agencies was just a very short two page opinion. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=66.0s)]
*  And that was unorthodox for the shadow docket because they usually just resolve things with just a few sentences. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=78.0s)]
*  So it's a real question about how the court uses its shadow docket. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=83.0s)]
*  And it's going to be an even bigger problem with so many important cases pending on that docket right now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=87.0s)]
*  And Dahlia, for a lot of Americans, they'll say, I've never listened to a Supreme Court argument in my life. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=92.0s)]
*  Why does that make a difference? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=98.0s)]
*  But first of all, you do. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=100.0s)]
*  And second of all, in certain cases that reach a certain level of urgency or importance, including the decision on Donald Trump's immunity, people listen to those things. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=102.0s)]
*  We would play them live on TV. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=112.0s)]
*  You couldn't watch it because you can't have cameras in the Supreme Court. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=114.0s)]
*  But we listen to the audio. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=117.0s)]
*  People get information through these arguments and listening to what the justices are asking. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=119.0s)]
*  So this concept of a shadow docket, though it may be efficient to get through a lot of things, does leave us with more questions and answers sometimes. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=127.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=135.0s)]
*  And, you know, maybe a good way to think about it is through the lens of this legitimacy question, this court legitimacy question that we've been talking about for years now and the sort of plummeting public trust in the court. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=138.0s)]
*  Well, what is the single most essential thing that a judicial body can do to instill in the public the sense that this is a lawyerly, sober, fact-based process? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=151.0s)]
*  Well, as you say, part of that is having arguments, which we all listen to, which we can read the transcripts of. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=164.0s)]
*  Part of it is briefing, right? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=171.0s)]
*  Having briefs in the case and having a lengthy process of letting this percolate in the courts below so that we have a district court opinion and we've got a circuit court opinion, right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=173.0s)]
*  We've got a fulsome development of the facts and the issues and an opinion. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=183.0s)]
*  The opinion is the single most important thing because that stands, right, as precedent going forward, not just for credibility for the public. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=189.0s)]
*  It's guidance for courts in similar cases. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=198.0s)]
*  Oh, right. This looks like that. We'll do that thing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=201.0s)]
*  As Melissa just said, as you just said, that's gone on the shadow docket. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=204.0s)]
*  There's no argument. There's very spartan briefing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=208.0s)]
*  The court below has been leapfrogged so that we don't have a developed record. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=212.0s)]
*  And then you get this kind of back of the envelope reasoning from the justices to three sentences. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=217.0s)]
*  Sometimes you don't even know how they voted. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=222.0s)]
*  And for a court that's really grappling with keeping a hold on the public respect in regard to do this kind of sort of slot machine justice on the fly is the worst possible way to say we're a serious entity. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=225.0s)]
*  So, Melissa, what's the what's the alternative? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=238.0s)]
*  Because one thing I think people register is that the Supreme Court does not take every case that comes its way. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=241.0s)]
*  It has to make choices and it makes its own choices on that stuff. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=245.0s)]
*  So there's some people who'd like relief from the Supreme Court who don't will never get it because there won't be hearing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=249.0s)]
*  So what does the Supreme Court do when something is urgent? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=253.0s)]
*  We have had examples of the Supreme Court acting in a sort of a proper procedural way in cases of urgency. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=256.0s)]
*  But it feels like everything's urgent these days. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=263.0s)]
*  So what what would what would right look like? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=265.0s)]
*  What would success look like to you in this in this arena? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=267.0s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that the court is capable of moving in an expedited fashion when it wants to. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=271.0s)]
*  It hasn't always wanted to, as we saw last term with the Trump versus United States immunity case where they seem to drag their feet well until the end of term on an issue that really did need expedited resolution. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=277.0s)]
*  But we have seen in other cases that the court has recognized the importance of more robust deliberations, certainly for the public to see. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=289.0s)]
*  And they've migrated cases from the shadow docket to the actual merits docket to take them up. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=298.0s)]
*  So, for example, the question back in 2021 over the Texas bounty hunter abortion law initially appeared on the shadow docket and the court made a decision on the shadow docket, but then went on to migrate the rest of that litigation to its merits docket where it then continued to litigate and decide that case. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=304.0s)]
*  So that is certainly an option and the court has done that in the past. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=322.0s)]
*  All right, we're back in school with Melissa Murray and Dahlia Lithwick. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=325.0s)]
*  Melissa, you just said something at the end of your last answer, which reminds me of my failure as a journalist because it was the whole point of this exercise was to explain to people the difference between the emergency docket and the merit document because there are people who hear these Supreme Court decisions, Dahlia, and they think that they're decisions that are merit decisions. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=328.0s)]
*  And so that's some of the confusion because you hear that the Supreme Court did something. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=350.0s)]
*  If you're the average person, you wonder, did they have a whole hearing? Did they look at the merits of this or did they do something else? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=354.0s)]
*  Now, I don't know what to tell the average person. Should that matter or not? But they do wonder about that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=361.0s)]
*  Maybe this is going to be an incredibly fatuous sounding analogy, but maybe we'll go with it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=368.0s)]
*  Maybe a way to think of it is, you know, you're in fourth grade and somebody throws a spitball at your head and the ordinary procedure is you go to the teacher, you explain how it feels. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=375.0s)]
*  You know, the teacher says, you know, go to the guidance counselor, you go to the guidance counselor, the guidance counselor says, I don't think so. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=388.0s)]
*  You go to the principal, you explain again, right? The principal makes a decision. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=395.0s)]
*  Maybe the best way to think of the emergency docket is just that you go straight to the principal's office and you start screaming. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=399.0s)]
*  There's no facts. There's no procedure. There's no record. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=405.0s)]
*  And then the principal is kind of making a decision based on, and that's exactly what the emergency docket is, as Melissa and I have just explained it, based on kind of often speculation about what might happen in the future and that or some of these cases we're talking about. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=409.0s)]
*  You know, I think this side is going to win. I think the other side is going to win. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=425.0s)]
*  I think hardship will fall more on this party or another party. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=429.0s)]
*  So there's just no there there. And I want to be really clear. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=432.0s)]
*  People who criticize the shadow docket understand and Melissa made this point, too. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=436.0s)]
*  You need to have an emergency docket. There's always been an emergency docket, usually used for executions and things that are genuine emergencies. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=441.0s)]
*  But the Humphreys executor case that Melissa just described, literally the emergency is that people are being removed and reinstated onto federal, you know, multiparty federal boards. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=449.0s)]
*  And the emergency is the administration didn't think that we should be, you know, putting them on and taking them off. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=461.0s)]
*  That was the hardship being asserted. That's not a hardship. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=468.0s)]
*  That's literally the Supreme Court overturning a 90 year old case without explaining why. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=471.0s)]
*  Which, Melissa, that's a perfect example. That's a discussion about the about executive authority in the administrative state. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=478.0s)]
*  It's a conversation we've had with the Chevron doctrine. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=484.0s)]
*  This is the kind of thing that deserves the full treatment by by the Supreme Court. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=487.0s)]
*  There's there's no reason to have shifted the entire way we think about government on the basis of an emergency docket. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=491.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. This case that Dahlia is referencing, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=498.0s)]
*  this is the case involving the removed heads of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Bureau is one that the administration is very deeply invested in. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=501.0s)]
*  They would like to be able to remove the heads of independent agencies without cause, which violates certain terms of Congress and also violates that 1935 Supreme Court precedent Humphreys executor. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=511.0s)]
*  They have brought this appeal to the court on the court shadow docket. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=522.0s)]
*  I think what is so irksome about the court's decision on this case is that the court essentially says we're making an emergency ruling that it's going to be more disruptive to continue reinstating and removing and reinstating removing these officers. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=525.0s)]
*  So we're just going to let the administration have its way for now. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=537.0s)]
*  And then eventually this case will percolate up to us on the merits docket and we will issue a final resolution. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=541.0s)]
*  But one of the most canny things about the emergency docket is sometimes the court uses this to forecast where it is on these substantive questions. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=547.0s)]
*  And the very fact that you have six members of the Supreme Court saying they're fine with the administration removing and getting these people off and they're concerned about the disruption of reinstating them already means that this court has made up its mind about Humphreys executor. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=557.0s)]
*  The fact that they didn't even mention this almost 90 year old precedent in resolving the shadow docket question shows you what the way forward looks like. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=574.0s)]
*  And Elena Kagan in her dissent in that decision made that clear. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=583.0s)]
*  This court effectively overruled a precedent by allowing the administration to remove these people and not then have them reinstated, which would be required by the court's existing precedents. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=587.0s)]
*  They've effectively overruled this and they've done it in the shadows of the shadow docket. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=599.0s)]
*  And that's the issue, right, Dolly? It's not that the court can't overrule something they've done before. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=603.0s)]
*  It's not that they can't make an argument about why that precedent may have been flawed or why things are different. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=609.0s)]
*  It's that they're not doing it. What we would like is for this to be fulsome and to hear all the arguments and then we would debate them all and the American public can come to its own conclusion about what it thinks the court did. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=615.0s)]
*  But at least it would have it would have the facts in front of them in a big in oral arguments in a in a big decision in dissents, maybe one or two dissents. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=626.0s)]
*  They'd be able to read it all at least try and understand it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=634.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. And one of the things that really, I think, sent Justice Kagan into orbit in this same dissent is that because the Supreme Court is doing the super, you know, quick and dirty tweet analysis where they're not really explaining themselves at all. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=638.0s)]
*  At some point, they say this is going to be true for all of the other agencies, but not for the Fed. Why? Mumble, mumble, mumble words. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=655.0s)]
*  And what Justice Kagan essentially says is that makes no sense. You've said the Fed is carved out. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=666.0s)]
*  You know, the president can't simply fire the head of the Fed without telling us why. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=671.0s)]
*  So how is any court in the future to judge what the case law is and the COVID cases? You may recall those mitigation cases about whether states could limit at religious services, limit attendance because of COVID. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=676.0s)]
*  The court would say no, rely on our shadow docket decision that is utterly inscrutable Jackson Pollock material and lower court judges don't know what the law is. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=691.0s)]
*  And so I think you're exactly right. If the court's one obligation is to show its work and to sort of leave us a map, this is the opposite of that. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=701.0s)]
*  And it becomes really this very subjective question of is this an emergency? Who thinks it's an emergency? And what a six justices feel. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwaquhSiV4&t=711.0s)]
