# ‘Who gets custody of Kanye?’: The best jokes on Trump’s breakup with Elon Musk
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k)
*  If only you guys could see the commercial break. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=0.0s)]
*  I know. Seriously. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=2.2s)]
*  Public breakdown of the ill-fated Trump-Musk bromance [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=3.4s)]
*  was not just the talk of the town here in D.C. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=6.74s)]
*  and across the political world and on Twitter. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=9.14s)]
*  It was also pure catnip for the late-night comics. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=11.68s)]
*  Seriously, their relationship went off a cliff [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=15.98s)]
*  faster than a self-driving Tesla. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=17.68s)]
*  So, to recap, Elon insulted Trump, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=19.28s)]
*  trashed his bill, and then said he's in the Epstein files. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=21.28s)]
*  Anyway, now Elon is now the Democratic front-runner [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=24.26s)]
*  for 2028, so that's a big deal. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=26.76s)]
*  Trump's gonna have to get one of those bumper stickers [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=29.72s)]
*  for his Tesla that says, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=31.58s)]
*  I bought this before Elon told everyone [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=32.92s)]
*  I was on Epstein's plane. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=35.08s)]
*  So now Donald Trump is a Tesla owner who hates Elon Musk? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=37.82s)]
*  He's never been more relatable. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=43.96s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=46.96s)]
*  Thankfully, a cooler head has stepped in to calm things down. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=49.9s)]
*  Kanye tweeted, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=53.5s)]
*  Bros, please, no. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=54.720000000000006s)]
*  Hug emoji. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=57.36s)]
*  We love you both so much. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=58.96s)]
*  We know things are nuts when the guy trying to bring [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=61.36s)]
*  everyone together is Kanye West. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=64.06s)]
*  I feel bad for Donald Trump. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=66.26s)]
*  I mean, first he lost Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=67.94s)]
*  Now, Elon, he's running out of friends. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=70.04s)]
*  This is so hard for everyone, except me, of course. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=72.84s)]
*  This is great for me. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=75.68s)]
*  I mean, Kanye. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=78.78s)]
*  Bros, no! [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=80.22s)]
*  No! [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=81.42s)]
*  He's like the kid with dueling parents. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=82.78s)]
*  Who gets custody of Kanye? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=85.92s)]
*  Exactly. Not us. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  The two of them can't get that child. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=88.72s)]
*  I mean, we all saw this coming. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=92.26s)]
*  We knew this fight was gonna come. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=95.66000000000001s)]
*  Do you think it was gonna be as big as it's been? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  I mean, as personal? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=99.86000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the efficacy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=101.56s)]
*  No, these are too narcissistic, petty, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  and if this weren't morning television and television, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=107.30000000000001s)]
*  there'd be another word that would follow that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=109.84s)]
*  But of course we knew it was gonna be this bad. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=112.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=114.72s)]
*  Like, real bad. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=115.22s)]
*  Petty, just in time for Pride Month. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=116.4s)]
*  Very fun for all of us. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=117.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=118.9s)]
*  We're having a good old time on Twitter, finally. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=119.4s)]
*  You're still on there? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=123.14s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=124.24s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=124.88s)]
*  Don't tell people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=125.34s)]
*  You just told people. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=126.38s)]
*  No, it's just us here, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=127.24s)]
*  This isn't live or anything. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=128.9s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=130.4s)]
*  Cool, cool, cool. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=131.08s)]
*  Actually, so that makes it, this is why I should probably [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=131.78s)]
*  read this now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=134.24s)]
*  Just for us. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKl7z_L-4k&t=134.88s)]
