# Nicolle Wallace on Trump's new tariff threats: 'There are no deals'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU)
*  A sharp new turn in Donald Trump's tariff roller coaster ride today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump telling the world and the American consumers, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=4.4s)]
*  brace for a brand new round of tariffs. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=8.0s)]
*  At the end of his foreign trip, Trump announced that the administration [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=10.4s)]
*  will start sending out letters to trading partners [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=13.68s)]
*  to let them know of new tariff rates. Watch. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=16.4s)]
*  We have at the same time 150 countries that want to make a deal, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  but you're not able to see that many countries. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  So at a certain point over the next two to three weeks, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=28.16s)]
*  I think Scott and Howard will be sending letters out, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=31.04s)]
*  essentially telling people, it would be very fair, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=34.72s)]
*  but we'll be telling people what they'll be paying to do business in the United States. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=37.2s)]
*  So essentially be paying to be doing business in the United States. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=43.36s)]
*  I guess you could say they could appeal it, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=48.08s)]
*  but for the most part, I think we're going to be very fair, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=50.08s)]
*  but it's not it's not possible to meet the number of people that want to see us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  Check your mailbox. We're sending you a letter. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  What? What? What happened to all the deals that the administration was going to make? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  What happened when Donald Trump climbed down from his so-called reciprocal tariff rates? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=69.6s)]
*  Trump officials then tried to save face when that almost collapsed the global economy [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=75.28s)]
*  by claiming that Mr. Art of the deal himself, the best deal maker ever. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=80.24s)]
*  And the Trump administration was going to ink hundreds and hundreds of deals. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=84.8s)]
*  Here's Peter Navarro saying that last month. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=88.8s)]
*  So we're going to run 90 deals in 90 days is possible. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=91.52s)]
*  The boss is going to be the chief negotiator. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=97.2s)]
*  Nothing's done without him looking very carefully at it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=100.08s)]
*  He has such a fine attention to detail. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=103.52s)]
*  Such a fine attention to detail that there are no deals. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=107.68s)]
*  There's no deals. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=110.64s)]
*  There's a framework for one deal with the UK. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=112.88s)]
*  By the way, the UK accounts for 3% of our trade with the world. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=116.8s)]
*  There's a framework for negotiations for a possible deal with China, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  not 90 deals in 90 days. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=127.04s)]
*  Like not even close, not even by Trumpian math. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=129.04s)]
*  So today's announcement by Trump actually raises more questions than it answers. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  They're sending letters. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=138.88s)]
*  It's unclear what countries are going to get their letters [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  and whether these new tariff rates in the letters [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=143.76s)]
*  are going to replace the reciprocal tariff rates [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=146.16s)]
*  that were put in place by Donald Trump in the Rose Garden on Liberation Day, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=148.56s)]
*  but then subsequently frozen after Liberation Day. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=152.56s)]
*  Again, because the global economy started to crater. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=156.4s)]
*  In other words, businesses and consumers don't know what to expect now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=160.48s)]
*  But they do know because of that announcement on camera [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=167.2s)]
*  that there are letters coming and so we're all bracing for more confusion [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  and more uncertainty on top of the chaos and confusion [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=173.76s)]
*  that has already put consumers in this country in a sour and anxious mood. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=177.6s)]
*  CNBC reports this, quote, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=182.72s)]
*  U.S. consumers are becoming increasingly worried that tariffs will lead to higher inflation. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=184.32s)]
*  That's according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday, quote, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  Tariffs were spontaneously mentioned by nearly three quarters of consumers, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=193.6s)]
*  up from almost 60 percent in April. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=197.84s)]
*  Uncertainty over trade policy continues to dominate consumers thinking about the economy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=200.16s)]
*  That's according to the survey director. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  That should come as no surprise because consumers are already paying more [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  for the same things, all because of Donald Trump. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  CNBC adding this, reporting, quote, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=214.0s)]
*  Even with the pauses on import levies against China and other countries, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=216.16s)]
*  the effective tariff rate for goods entering the U.S. is still significantly higher today [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=219.68s)]
*  than it was before Donald Trump's inauguration in January. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=224.88s)]
*  Donald Trump, continuing to confuse and threaten the American consumers and businesses [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=229.44s)]
*  with more economic mayhem and pain, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=235.28s)]
*  is where we start today with some of our favorite reporters and friends. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=238.16s)]
*  Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Michigan, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=241.44s)]
*  Justin Wolfers is back, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=245.52s)]
*  and MSNBC columnist, author of the newsletter To the Contrary, Charlie Sykes is here. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=247.12s)]
*  Justin, just tell me, and I have to say, I am happy that another segment of the world, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  another segment of American civic society has to watch the things he says because it [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=260.72s)]
*  threatens to drop the bottom out of their existence, and that is, you know, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=266.24s)]
*  the markets and small and large businesses and the American consumers. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  It doesn't mean I'm happy about the pain and the suffering that he's causing, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=273.84s)]
*  but I am glad that there are more people to help me understand what he's saying. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=278.23999999999995s)]
*  What do you understand this announcement about a new round of letters to mean? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=282.23999999999995s)]
*  Right. So the good news for you personally, Nicole, just for you, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  is you can start showing reruns. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=292.0s)]
*  Don't have to turn up to work tomorrow because we've done this once before. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=293.67999999999995s)]
*  Let me remind everyone how we got here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=297.44s)]
*  April 2nd was Liberation Day. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=300.23999999999995s)]
*  Trump and his blokes got in a room and wrote down some numbers. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=303.12s)]
*  They came out and said, here's our numbers. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=306.32s)]
*  They were utterly incoherent. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=308.56s)]
*  The penguins on the herd in McDonald Islands were very upset about it, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=310.64s)]
*  but they weren't the only ones. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=313.52s)]
*  So was Wall Street. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=314.72s)]
*  And stocks fell by 12% over the next week as we were looking at a near certain recession in the eye. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=316.24s)]
*  So time passes, seven days, stocks crater, businesses call the White House. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=324.08s)]
*  They say, what the heck are you doing? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=328.8s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=330.16s)]
*  So Trump comes out and says, just kidding. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=331.92s)]
*  I'm putting a 90-day pause because in reality, I didn't want tariffs. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=336.4s)]
*  I wanted bargaining power so I could make deals. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=340.96s)]
*  I'm going to make 90 in 90 days. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=345.68s)]
*  In fact, we've had updates. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=347.12s)]
*  We've had blokes on TV come on out. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=349.44s)]
*  So we've made eight deals. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=351.12s)]
*  We've made 12 deals. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=352.16s)]
*  We've made 16 deals. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=353.04s)]
*  We're going to make 90 in 90 days. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=354.08s)]
*  And then it turns out they've made two. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=357.2s)]
*  Let me read the last line of the UK deal. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=359.92s)]
*  This document does not constitute a legally binding agreement. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=362.88s)]
*  The China deal was, let's talk again. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=366.88s)]
*  So the deals aren't going well. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=370.24s)]
*  So he says, you know what I'm going to do? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to get in a room and make up some numbers. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=373.04s)]
*  Same as last time. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=376.64s)]
*  There's one important difference, Nicole, and it's fabulously important. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=377.36s)]
*  It's going to send a letter this time as well. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=381.44s)]
*  No deals. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=385.04s)]
*  There are no deals. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=385.92s)]
*  It is Charlie Sykes like Mexico paying for the wall. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=387.28s)]
*  Mexico never paid for the wall. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=391.44s)]
*  There was very little wall ever built. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=392.8s)]
*  There are no deals. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=395.76s)]
*  As Justin just said, there are no deals. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  That is a factually accurate statement. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=402.47999999999996s)]
*  What there is is economic uncertainty for businesses large and small [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=406.96s)]
*  and higher prices for consumers, which is a regressive tax [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=412.64s)]
*  that disproportionately impacts working class and low income Americans. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=417.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=424.24s)]
*  Well, I'm sure that, you know, Donald Trump, who is a well-known Bible salesman, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  will recognize the aphorism from Proverbs that as a dog returns to his vomit, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  so a fool repeats his folly. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=432.8s)]
*  Donald Trump keeps coming back to the same answer, to the same question [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=435.36s)]
*  that he failed on the test the last time. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=439.76s)]
*  So we're right back where we started from again. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=442.32000000000005s)]
*  Here's just an indication that Donald Trump simply does not have a full grasp [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  of how this is playing out globally and the impact on consumers. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=450.64000000000004s)]
*  So you're absolutely right. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=456.48s)]
*  I mean, there's two key points. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=457.68s)]
*  Number one, I mean, we're back to the uncertainty. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  The economy has been frozen in many ways. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=462.24s)]
*  Consumers are getting increasingly nervous. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=465.04s)]
*  They're about to discover how deeply regressive these tariffs are [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=468.0s)]
*  because the tariffs tax goods. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=471.84s)]
*  They don't tax services. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=475.12s)]
*  They tax the things that working class people pay for, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=476.32s)]
*  not the kinds of things that many of Donald Trump's buddies pay for. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=480.4s)]
*  And so we're going to be seeing this, the downstream effects of this, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  very, very, very soon. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  And I think that there was probably some wishful thinking [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  on the part of the business community and the markets [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=493.36s)]
*  that after he blinked on the China deal, that Donald Trump had learned his lesson. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=495.84s)]
*  Well, this is the one fixed idea that Donald Trump has had in his head [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=501.12s)]
*  for 20 or 30 years. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=507.04s)]
*  And he's going to keep coming back to it again and again and again. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=508.56s)]
*  And despite all the wishful thinking of the markets, here we are. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=512.88s)]
*  We're going to be replaying this again. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=515.92s)]
*  Let me read again. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=517.44s)]
*  I'd like to sort of stay focused on what this means for American consumers [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=519.84s)]
*  who make up traditionally the health and the resilience of our economy. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=526.0s)]
*  This is new reporting in Bloomberg. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=531.44s)]
*  Quote, Trump to keep 30% China tariffs in place until late in 25. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=533.28s)]
*  Quote, US levies on Chinese products imposed this year will likely hold at 30% [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=539.68s)]
*  through late 2025, according to a Bloomberg survey [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=545.2s)]
*  that had 22 respondents from a mix of Asian, European, and US fund managers, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=548.56s)]
*  banks, and research firms. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=552.8s)]
*  Much lower than before the fall this week. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=554.48s)]
*  The current rate is high enough to wipe out 70% of Chinese shipments [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=557.12s)]
*  to the world's largest economy in the medium term. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  That's a projection from Bloomberg economics. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  I also have this reporting that I think, Justin, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=568.08s)]
*  I'm going to need your help explaining from CNBC [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=571.44s)]
*  that the stacking of tariffs pushes the true cost for retail goods much higher than 30%. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=575.36s)]
*  Prices that we pay on the sticker or on the tag of a sweater [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=580.48s)]
*  isn't just going to be the price before Donald, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=584.4s)]
*  while Joe Biden was president, plus 30%, the Trump tariff tax. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=586.32s)]
*  It could go up by 46%. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=591.12s)]
*  A cotton sweater, that's 16% most favored nation, plus the fentanyl and reciprocal tariffs. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=593.52s)]
*  Women's bathing suits from China face a tariff of 54.9%, 24.9% most favored nation, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=599.44s)]
*  plus the fentanyl and reciprocal tariffs. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  A baby's dress that's made in China faces a tariff of 41.5%, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=608.0s)]
*  11.5% most favored nation, plus the fentanyl and reciprocal tariffs. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=613.44s)]
*  There have been tariff announcement after tariff announcement after tariff announcement. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=617.6s)]
*  Trump again today on camera talking about a letter [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=622.0s)]
*  that will be on top of the other tariffs he's already announced. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=624.72s)]
*  Just talk about how that layers into the price tag on an item at Walmart or another retailer. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=627.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=634.32s)]
*  So all of those numbers you read were just very confusing. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=635.6s)]
*  So let me de-confuse them. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=638.08s)]
*  I want you to remember all the way back in time to the start of January of this year. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=639.7600000000001s)]
*  Back then, we did have tariffs on China. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=644.8000000000001s)]
*  There were tariffs that the first Trump administration had put on. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=647.2800000000001s)]
*  There were tariffs that the Biden administration had continued or put on. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  And there's even tariffs from earlier. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=653.36s)]
*  Those tariffs on average are probably about 8%. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=655.84s)]
*  But they're higher for some things, like it sounded like girls' dresses, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=659.36s)]
*  and they're lower for other things. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=662.32s)]
*  So those tariffs are there. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=663.84s)]
*  Then Trump comes along and says, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=665.44s)]
*  I know how to prevent fentanyl getting into the US. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=666.72s)]
*  I'll put a 20% tariff on China. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=668.72s)]
*  That is a tax on Americans importing goods from China. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=671.0400000000001s)]
*  So now all of those numbers go up by 20. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=674.1600000000001s)]
*  And then he added his Liberation Day tariff of another 10. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=676.32s)]
*  Well, he actually added a lot more and then brought it all back down. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=679.6800000000001s)]
*  Let me tell you what it does mean on average. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=683.0400000000001s)]
*  It means on average, the tariff rate is the Trump 30%, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=684.6400000000001s)]
*  plus the 8% he inherited from history, so 38%. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=688.0s)]
*  And all of those are extra costs being charged to Americans. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=692.08s)]
*  And we'll either go through to higher price tags in the store [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=695.6s)]
*  or lower profit margins for the store that's selling it to you. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=698.5600000000001s)]
*  But from past experience, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=701.84s)]
*  most of it's going to be higher price tags for Americans. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAxZ9qmaeU&t=703.2s)]
