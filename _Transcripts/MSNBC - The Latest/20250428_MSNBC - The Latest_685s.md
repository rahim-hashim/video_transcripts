Video Description: As his second term approaches the 100-day mark, President Trump is defiant, pledging that he'll keep going with his tariffs even if they cause some economic chaos.

# 'None of this makes sense': Trump's economy just doesn't add up
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg)
*  It is day 99 of the second Trump administration and we're starting this evening with money power politics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=0.0s)]
*  According to Donald Trump, he runs the country and the world. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=6.4s)]
*  That is what he told the Atlantic about his view of his second term in office. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=10.4s)]
*  In the interview, Trump also pushed back on the idea that economic chaos would make him roll back his tariffs. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=14.4s)]
*  He said, well it always affects you a little bit, there's no red line or certain number that would make him change course. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  But it is not just Wall Street or the business community that's currently uneasy about Trump's economy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  Recent polls are showing that most Americans disapprove of how Trump has handled the economy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=32.8s)]
*  Of course, Trump's team in public is brushing off all the polls and the worries, saying Trump is focused on putting Americans first. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=38.8s)]
*  While the business world is very concerned about the trade war with China, Treasury Secretary Scott Besson says the ball will hit some China's court. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=46.8s)]
*  I believe that it's up to China to de-escalate because they sell five times more to us than we sell to them. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  And so these 125, 145 percent tariffs are unsustainable. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=64.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, Congress is back after two weeks off and now Republicans in the House and the Senate have got to figure out how they are going to actually deliver Trump's agenda, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=70.2s)]
*  including of course massive tax cuts and how they're going to pay for them. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=80.2s)]
*  Today's speaker, Mike Johnson, stay with me for this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson met with the president and said the next few weeks will be critical. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  He has vowed to get the bill on Trump's desk by Memorial Day. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  Okay, Memorial Day. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  But the Senate leader said it could take a little bit longer than that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  And then Secretary Besson, who also met with congressional leaders today, set a new goal to pass the bill by the 4th of July. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  But put all of those timelines aside, I have called source after source after source. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  And none of this makes sense, at least not to me. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=113.0s)]
*  The administration has pitched the use of tariffs in several different ways, but the scenarios don't support one argument. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=116.0s)]
*  They actually cancel one another out. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=122.0s)]
*  Secretary Besson has argued the tariffs will pay for the tax cuts and pay down our massive debt. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=125.0s)]
*  Those are his top two priorities. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=130.0s)]
*  But at the same time, he is the chief tariff negotiator and has argued some of the tariffs imposed are untenable and is actively working on a number of deals. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=132.0s)]
*  So my question, if we get the trade deals done and we drop the tariffs, how are we going to pay for the tax cuts and pay down our debt? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=142.4s)]
*  Luckily, I have really smart guests here tonight. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=151.4s)]
*  Maybe they can answer it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=153.4s)]
*  Our lead-off panel, Ron Insana is here. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=155.4s)]
*  CNBC senior analyst David Drucker, senior writer at The Dispatch, and Tyler Pager, New York Times White House correspondent. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=157.4s)]
*  His upcoming book, 2024, How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, is out this summer. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=163.4s)]
*  Ron, this doesn't make sense to me. How about you? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=169.4s)]
*  Well, no, because the president added another wrinkle, which was that he was going to eliminate the income tax for people making less than $200,000 and use the tariffs to pay for that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=171.8s)]
*  At one juncture, he even said possibly eliminating all income taxes. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=179.8s)]
*  You would require tariffs of about 125 percent to raise the $4 trillion plus that we gather in income taxes from individuals every year. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=183.8s)]
*  So they have competing explanations for how they're going to use the money. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=191.8s)]
*  The math ain't math-ing, as they like to say these days. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=195.8s)]
*  And there's just no explanation, no cogent explanation as to how they're going to accomplish all these things, particularly when you're talking about these tax cuts, which are not just an extension of the current cuts that were passed in 2017, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  but also additional cuts that could add anywhere from $5 to $11 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  David, Donald Trump has very, very loyal supporters, and he is a very, very good salesman. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  But the numbers don't lie. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  Can he continue to say things like this? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=226.6s)]
*  We're going to cut taxes for everybody making under $200,000 when the numbers aren't adding up and it's impacting people at every level economically? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=228.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think there are a couple of different issues there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=238.6s)]
*  Remember, the president has campaigned on and what's going to be in this reconciliation bill, at least we think, is an elimination of taxes on tips, an elimination of taxes on overtime, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=240.6s)]
*  and an elimination of taxes on Social Security income, as well as a new tax deduction for financed automobiles as long as they're American-made. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=251.0s)]
*  So there's a lot that congressional Republicans have to try and slip in here and they have to try and figure out how to make the numbers work, because in reconciliation, things have to balance out. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=259.0s)]
*  That's how you're able to do it this way and avoid the filibuster. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=271.0s)]
*  I think for the president's loyal base, they're going to give all of this time to shake out and they have a lot of faith in Trump from their point of view as a businessman who knows how to deliver. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=274.4s)]
*  And there's a deep distrust in government and institutions. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=286.4s)]
*  And so when eggheads like us argue about math, they just say, you were the guys that have been arguing about math for years and you got us into the Great Recession and you mishandled the pandemic. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=290.4s)]
*  And we're just pretty much done listening to you for the time being. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=302.79999999999995s)]
*  Now, if the economy were to sink to particular levels, that base gets whittled away a little bit and you start to lose not only massive amounts of independent voters, but you're going to lose some percentage of Republicans. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=305.79999999999995s)]
*  And then the president and his party are in trouble. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  But I just think it's too soon to say that we're going to get there because we're not there yet. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  But we are hearing the warnings, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=328.79999999999995s)]
*  And then Carl Rove goes on Fox News and says Donald Trump is in very bad shape on the economy. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=331.2s)]
*  And yes, Carl Rove isn't inside the White House, but he is certainly a Republican this White House listens to. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=337.2s)]
*  Tyler, what are they saying behind the scenes? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=343.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think there is real concern. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=345.2s)]
*  I mean, this is the difference between campaigning and governing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=348.2s)]
*  The biggest talking points for Donald Trump as a candidate for president was railing against Joe Biden and the Biden administration when Kamala Harris took over the ticket, their stewardship of the economy. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  And the Biden administration struggled mightily to explain why prices were rising. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  And even as they tried to blame Putin or blame the pandemic, Americans ultimately felt the price hike at home and that contributed to the unpopularity of the Biden administration. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  Trump was successful in making the economy a centerpiece of his campaign. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=379.0s)]
*  But they know that voters, when they head to the polls for the midterms, will be voting largely based on how they're feeling economically and regardless of the messaging. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=383.0s)]
*  And obviously, Trump has leaned into this messaging argument about tariffs and is convincing his base. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=393.0s)]
*  But ultimately, they need to win over independence. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=400.0s)]
*  Midterms are always hard for incumbent presidents. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=402.0s)]
*  And so this is something that Republicans across Washington and across the nation are concerned about. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=404.4s)]
*  Now, Trump is not someone that's going to lean into that and recognize that publicly. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=409.4s)]
*  But privately behind closed doors, Republicans are acutely aware. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=414.4s)]
*  And we saw Scott Besson and Howard Lotnick have some success with Donald Trump in explaining this as he put in this 90-day pause. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=417.4s)]
*  Now, we'll see what happens over the course of the next few months with these trade deals and whether that's enough to get Trump to change course. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=424.4s)]
*  But also, as, Steph, you know, economists, analysts are worried that the damage has already been done and there's no way to just take the foot off the gas and release this and bring back the economic growth that we were seeing before the president put in these tariffs. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=430.79999999999995s)]
*  All right. But then let's talk about the 90-day pause, David, because Donald Trump said he's not flustered. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  He's not bothered by a little economic chaos. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=450.79999999999995s)]
*  And he's going to do what he wants to do regardless of the markets. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=453.79999999999995s)]
*  He's already proven he won't. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=457.79999999999995s)]
*  Right. The markets stock market tanked, bond market tanked, and Trump blinked and said, we're going to pause. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=460.2s)]
*  We're going to lower the tariffs. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=466.2s)]
*  I mean, Tyler just referenced Scott Besson and Howard Lotnick coming to him. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=467.2s)]
*  So the president could say he's unbothered, but he has shown us in the last two weeks he is. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=471.2s)]
*  Well, I think we've seen him react to markets. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=479.2s)]
*  We've also seen him deny the reality of the economy. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=481.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=484.2s)]
*  And I would say, this is just a rough period to get from here to there. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  He said that there's no rough period. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  Everything is just fine. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=492.59999999999997s)]
*  And look, we know that it is. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=494.59999999999997s)]
*  And I would say also the interesting thing about the troubling polling that is coming out just as he's about to reach that 100-day mark is that, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  unlike the first term, it's not about his personality or his provocative behavior or things that he says which were so shocking and different during his first four years. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  This is all based on performance and how people feel about, in particular, the economy. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=515.0s)]
*  Always their number one issue. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=520.0s)]
*  Their number one issue last November, their number one issue always. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=522.0s)]
*  And so I like to try and pay attention to what Trump does, not to what Trump says, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=525.0s)]
*  because on the same day he will say he cares, he doesn't care, I'm not going to change course, oh, I am changing course. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=532.0s)]
*  And so you just have to look at what he's doing and not what he's saying. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=540.0s)]
*  Well, Scott Besson would argue it's all part of the strategy. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=543.4s)]
*  I want to share when he talked about this yesterday because he was basically talking about Trump's yo-yoing back and forth [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=546.4s)]
*  because it got quite a reaction from the business community. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=554.4s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=557.4s)]
*  And game theory is called strategic uncertainty. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=559.4s)]
*  So you're not going to tell the person on the other side of the negotiation where you're going to end up. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=562.4s)]
*  And nobody's better at creating this leverage than President Trump. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=568.4s)]
*  When this interview was on television, I wasn't watching. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=573.4s)]
*  My phone lit up with people from the business community basically saying, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=576.4s)]
*  F you, dude. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=581.4s)]
*  How can you say to the American people, businesses big and small, oh, it's strategic chaos. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=582.4s)]
*  Nobody's better at this than Donald Trump. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=588.4s)]
*  Because the business people watching this are saying the businessman Donald Trump went bankrupt six times [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=590.4s)]
*  and we're praying and hoping that's not us. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=595.4s)]
*  The actual term in geopolitical terms is strategic ambiguity, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=598.8s)]
*  which is to keep your foes guessing with respect to what you might do next. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=602.8s)]
*  I don't think you want to do this on the economic front because the consequences, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=606.8s)]
*  as you indicate, for real people are quite important. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=609.8s)]
*  When you look at what's going to happen in the next couple of weeks, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=613.8s)]
*  and you hinted about this at the top of the show, we're going to see empty shelves. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=615.8s)]
*  We're going to see price hikes. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=619.8s)]
*  And we already are. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=621.8s)]
*  We're seeing even some of these Chinese importers like Ti Mu and Shain raise prices 377 percent. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=622.8s)]
*  For items that Americans have become accustomed to being extraordinarily inexpensive. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=628.1999999999999s)]
*  So while this strategic uncertainty is going on, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=632.1999999999999s)]
*  it's also uncertainty for every American. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  It's for every American business and anybody who's trying to make sense of this plan. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=638.1999999999999s)]
*  And someone also said in the president's cabinet, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=643.1999999999999s)]
*  it was Scott Bessett, that, you know, businesses make plans and buy inventory ahead of disruptions like this. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=646.1999999999999s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=652.1999999999999s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=653.1999999999999s)]
*  They absolutely do not. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=654.1999999999999s)]
*  Do you think they've loaded up on Halloween costumes? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=657.6s)]
*  And school supplies? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=658.6s)]
*  No, they absolutely haven't. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=659.6s)]
*  And small toy makers are getting killed right now. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=660.6s)]
*  Crushed. Small toy makers. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9IXanL1SRg&t=662.6s)]
