# Michigan's Jocelyn Benson slams Trump’s ‘bullying tactics’ as states sue Administration over threats
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc)
*  The Trump administration insists on withholding funds to states with policies they don't like. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=0.0s)]
*  Now a coalition of states is fighting back. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=5.96s)]
*  Twenty of them have filed suit against the administration over executive orders signed [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=8.22s)]
*  last month, threatening federal funding for so-called sanctuary cities that don't comply [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=12.36s)]
*  with Trump's immigration agenda. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=17.28s)]
*  They argue in two separate lawsuits that the funding cuts could have drastic effects on [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=19.12s)]
*  state projects like disaster relief and bridge and airport construction. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=24.64s)]
*  Attorney General Peter Nirana of Rhode Island, where one lawsuit was filed, wrote in a statement, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=29.14s)]
*  quote, we are experiencing creeping authoritarianism in this country and as a people we must continue [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=34.86s)]
*  to resist. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=41.14s)]
*  With us now is Michigan's Secretary of State and author of The Purpose for Warrior, Standing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=42.58s)]
*  Up for What's Right When the Stakes Are High, Jocelyn Benson. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=47.08s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=54.18s)]
*  I guess first and foremost, how do you square the circle for with Donald Trump, with this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=55.74s)]
*  executive order saying they're withholding federal funds for you guys doing kind of states [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=62.22s)]
*  rights with Republicans and conservatives who've always said state rights above all? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=66.3s)]
*  How do is that something how do we explain to people how that makes any kind of sense? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=70.74s)]
*  It doesn't, but it's a tool that bullies use to try to get people to control and get people [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=76.26s)]
*  to accede to their demands, even when they're really bad demands. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=81.53999999999999s)]
*  It immediately reminded me of 2020 when I was working to ensure people could vote in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=84.74s)]
*  the midst of a pandemic and the president tweeted, which is a thing at the time, that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=90.5s)]
*  he was going to withhold all federal funding from the state of Michigan because I was sending [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=95.3s)]
*  out information on how people could vote. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=98.86s)]
*  So it's a bullying tactic that is exactly the opposite of what we need from a president, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=100.97999999999999s)]
*  from anyone seeking to govern a nation at a time when people are struggling, when we [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=105.17999999999999s)]
*  need that federal support, that investment in our infrastructure, in our states, in our [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=109.86s)]
*  health care systems to ensure that people can thrive in not just in Michigan, but in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=114.13999999999999s)]
*  every state. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=118.97999999999999s)]
*  Jocelyn, though, is this risky politics for Democrats when your Republican-led house voted [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=119.97999999999999s)]
*  to end funding for sanctuary cities and you have you look at what happened in this election [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=126.58s)]
*  and there are voters who are really, really angry over what they see as lax immigration [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=132.22s)]
*  policies and especially how it's impacted big cities that are forced to use their resources [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=138.22s)]
*  to handle the influx of immigrants versus the resources for their communities. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=143.94s)]
*  Well, what I've seen in Michigan is that the root of the anger, whether it's directed outward [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=150.86s)]
*  or inward, is economic strife, meaning in Michigan, people are struggling. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=156.02s)]
*  We want to be able to afford child care. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  We want to be able to afford to buy a home in the communities we live in. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=162.78s)]
*  And every time a leader is not focused on solving that issue, yes, that anger does [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=165.74s)]
*  bubble up into other areas. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=170.58s)]
*  But that isn't a reason to shift focus away from what the people of Michigan or people [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=173.06s)]
*  of our country really need right now, which is leadership that's going to reduce the cost [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=177.78s)]
*  of living. It's actually going to make your life easier. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=181.46s)]
*  And you can do that while also standing by our values, which is being inclusive, which is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=183.9s)]
*  being welcoming and which is being a country that thrives together. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=188.62s)]
*  Secretary, in your book, The Personal Purposeful Warrior, you write about the times in your [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=192.34s)]
*  life that that challenged you in learning to stand up for yourself in the face of injustice. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=197.42s)]
*  What do you hope people get from your book, learn from your book after reading it? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=202.98s)]
*  Well, in this moment in our country, I mean, this started as a book to talk about what [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=208.98s)]
*  happened in 2020 and what it was like to stand up to a president of the United States and a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=212.82s)]
*  coordinated effort to overturn our democracy, to blunt the will of the people of the country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=217.22s)]
*  But what it evolved into was a really a call to action for us all in this moment to be [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=221.98s)]
*  warriors on behalf of ourselves, our loved ones, our nation, our communities. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=226.82s)]
*  And it's a how to guide as to how to stand up to bullies or in the workplace or in the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=231.46s)]
*  presidency who may be trying to rip away who we are. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=236.9s)]
*  We have much more strength than people in power oftentimes give us as citizens. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=239.7s)]
*  But we've got to use that power to fight back, to speak the truth, to step forward, especially [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=244.34s)]
*  in moments like this when so much of what of who we actually are as Americans is at risk. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=250.7s)]
*  One of the things that we've seen over the last few months is different governors taking [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=256.54s)]
*  different tactics when it comes to dealing with Donald Trump and how they can continue [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=260.7s)]
*  to make sure they get resources to the state, not getting on his bad side. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=265.18s)]
*  You're running for governor. How would you do that? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=268.94s)]
*  What does it look like to to balance that standing up and fighting back like you're [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=271.26s)]
*  talking about and making sure that your state continues to get what it needs? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=275.02s)]
*  Well, I've done that as secretary of state as the chief election officer for Michigan. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=280.46s)]
*  My job is to make sure elections are run well. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=284.62s)]
*  And that has required me to stand up to the president at times for me. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=287.42s)]
*  I my commitment as governor is the same as my commitment as the chief election officer [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=290.54s)]
*  for the state of Michigan. I will never waver in standing up to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=295.82s)]
*  anyone who threatens the rights and the freedoms of our citizens or their economic well-being, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=298.94s)]
*  no matter how powerful or how many threats they throw at me. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=303.74s)]
*  It's all about being rooted in the truth and the law and the facts and the constitution [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=306.7s)]
*  and being very clear and unequivocal of who I serve, which is the people of our state [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=310.54s)]
*  every day. And so I will stand up to anyone and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=314.7s)]
*  certainly work with anyone who will help me improve their economic well-being. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=317.18s)]
*  But it requires a backbone and requires a commitment to ensuring [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=320.78000000000003s)]
*  that we are unequivocal and demanding what's best for our people. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=324.54s)]
*  Secretary, the threats you were talking earlier in this segment, the threats that you [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=329.9s)]
*  were receiving either Michigan or you personally in 2020 versus the threats that you personally [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=336.86s)]
*  or the states receiving in 2025, have they gotten worse? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=343.5s)]
*  They're similar. I think what has escalated, frankly, is the cruelty, the similarity of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=351.1s)]
*  withholding federal funding. We heard the same thing in 2020, but the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=358.54s)]
*  cruelty and the impact of that economic threat is much greater now. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=362.53999999999996s)]
*  Especially because the voters of Michigan, the folks who voted for this president, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=370.14s)]
*  voted for him expecting he was going to drive down costs. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  And so for him to act in such a way, whether it's these reckless tariffs or withholding [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  federal funding, that does the opposite, that's an abdication of the expectation that folks in [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=382.78s)]
*  Michigan had of this presidency. So it's more cruel, it's more callous, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=387.5s)]
*  it's more reckless than before. And that has increased the pain [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=391.58s)]
*  that a lot of people are feeling as a result of these decisions. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=395.26s)]
*  Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, thank you very much. Congratulations on the book. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=398.78s)]
*  Thanks for having me. And people can go to JocelynBenson.com to learn more. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=404.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmb7F_U7uc&t=417.5s)]
