# Why one Republican congressman says Trump has ‘gone too far’ with his tariffs
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM)
*  President Trump's aggressive tariffs sparking global economic turmoil to the administration's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=0.0s)]
*  immigration crackdowns and Trump's fights with judges. The president is making many in his own [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=4.64s)]
*  party nervous. While most Republican lawmakers are sticking with Trump's agenda, at least one [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=10.48s)]
*  is reaching across the aisle and teaming up with Democrats to stop part of it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=16.56s)]
*  Republican Congressman Don Bacon of Nebraska and Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer of the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=21.28s)]
*  great state of New Jersey, that's my home state, are pushing a bill to, quote, return Congress's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=26.48s)]
*  constitutionally authorized role in setting and approving U.S. trade policy. Congressman Gottheimer [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=31.76s)]
*  and Congressman Bacon, both members of the Problem Solvers Caucus, join us now. Gentlemen, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=39.28s)]
*  thank you for coming to the weekend. Congressman Bacon, tell us more about this bill and why you [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=44.56s)]
*  congressman heard chose to side with Democrats on this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=50.4s)]
*  Congressman Bacon, thanks so much for joining us today. You know, I want to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=80.4s)]
*  add to Jonathan's question and dig a little deeper, but there are some people who have sort [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  of analogized this situation, Trump's insistence on imposing and implementing and keeping these [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=108.32s)]
*  tariffs to Joe Biden's fumbling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, that his approval ratings when [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=115.27999999999999s)]
*  he did do that pullout of Afghanistan really never recovered despite some wins that his [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=120.8s)]
*  administration have, including millions of jobs, legislative victories, and that he never was [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=126.63999999999999s)]
*  ultimately able to restore trust with voters. Is this Trump's Afghanistan moment? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=132.4s)]
*  Probably too early to say yet, but by the way, I agree with you, that was the beginning of the end [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=138.56s)]
*  of the Biden administration, it was Afghanistan. I think maybe more analogous, I'm worried about [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=141.84s)]
*  what happens to Ukraine if Ukraine falls. That would be likely put on President Trump's shoulders [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=146.08s)]
*  if that goes south. I hope it doesn't. I want an independent Ukraine. I think it's a little [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=153.44s)]
*  early to say what's going to happen with these tariffs. I do know that our experience with them [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=157.6s)]
*  are not good. Last time the Republicans, the bad tariffs was in 1930. That did not turn out well. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=161.52s)]
*  By the way, that was the last time Republicans were isolationists as well. So we're seeing a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=167.52s)]
*  brand of our party that's isolationist and protectionist. We haven't seen that since the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  1930s in our party. And I'm an old fashioned conservative, I believe in free trade, it should [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=176.4s)]
*  be fair. I do think the president, if I was in that position, I know I'm not, I would have maybe [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=181.68s)]
*  targeted and worked on China and the bad actors. But to go after all of our allies and do 80 [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=187.2s)]
*  countries at once, it's analogous to fighting a three front war. It puts us at a disadvantage. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=193.2s)]
*  I would have been more strategic. I would have negotiated with our European Union allies and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=199.76s)]
*  tried to work this out before we go into a tariff war. That's what I would advise. But [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  Congress, James Madison, I should say, never intended to let one person wage a wholesale [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=211.2s)]
*  tariff war, turn it on, turn it off, turn it on. He intended Congress to be in charge of this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=218.24s)]
*  And it's time we get it back. Congressman Gottheimer, you're part of the Problem [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=223.36s)]
*  Solvers Caucus. You're constantly working to try to talk with Republicans, get bills together. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=228.0s)]
*  One thing that we continue to hear is that Republicans behind the scenes, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=234.08s)]
*  one, they tell us certain things and then they go in front of a camera and say something a little [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=237.2s)]
*  bit different for fear of political retribution, maybe political violence. How difficult has it [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=240.88s)]
*  been in this first four months of this Trump administration to get Republicans to sign on to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  those, to get them to stand up and really take back the power that the Constitution gives Congress? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=251.44s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me. And it's certainly not been the easiest time for bipartisan [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=258.0s)]
*  government, to say the least. But then listen, you got Don right here talking in the last minutes [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  about how these tariffs are so destructive to our country and the families. In Jersey, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=266.56s)]
*  it's going to be a $5,000 tax increase with these tariffs. Prices going up, crushing people on [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=271.84s)]
*  everything from coffee in the morning, the clothing, you name it, the cars, you name it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=277.84s)]
*  It's going to have a huge impact and already is having a huge impact. Of course, in the first [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=283.76s)]
*  hundred days, crushed the market, hurt people's retirement savings. So I think that the chaos that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=288.24s)]
*  an impact that Don's talking about is right. I mean, you're seeing this is why we introduced [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=295.44s)]
*  this bipartisan legislation to say enough. You cannot just throw using, claiming to use emergency [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=299.68s)]
*  powers and emergency authority tariffs across the board at once, wreaking havoc on the economy and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=305.44s)]
*  people's savings and the price they're paying. So that's the kind of bipartisan work we need. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=310.8s)]
*  And I'm grateful, obviously, that Don's doing it and speaking out about this critical issue. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=314.88s)]
*  In an interview that will be aired in full tomorrow, Meet the Press moderator, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  Kristen Welker, talked with, had an interview with President Trump and talking about the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=325.76s)]
*  fears of recession and what Wall Street has been saying about those fears. I think we have that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=331.68s)]
*  clip. Let's play that. I want to get your reactions on the other side. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=338.16s)]
*  Some people on Wall Street have expressed concerns that the possibility of a recession [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=342.16s)]
*  is increasing. And I want to know what you think about that. Are you comfortable with the country [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=348.0s)]
*  potentially dipping into a recession for a period of time if you are able to achieve your long term [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  goals? Well, you know, you say some people on Wall Street say, well, I could tell you something else. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=359.12s)]
*  Some people on Wall Street say that we're going to have the greatest economy in history. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=363.44s)]
*  Why don't you talk about them? Because some people on Wall Street say this is the greatest thing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=368.88s)]
*  Well, that's what I'm getting at. That's what I'm getting at, though. It's the same question. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=372.24s)]
*  There are many people on Wall Street say this is going to be the greatest windfall ever happened. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=375.84s)]
*  And that's my question. Long term. Is it OK in the short term to have a recession? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  Look, yes, everything's OK. What we are, I said, this is a transition period. I think we're going [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=386.56s)]
*  to do fantastically. Gentlemen, I would love to get both of your reactions to this, but Congressman [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=393.28s)]
*  Bacon, how concerned to argue that the president is, is he right to downplay the fears of recession, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=400.96s)]
*  especially when there's a growing cry on Wall Street that a recession is coming? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=409.76s)]
*  There's surely mixed signals right now. And I think Josh put out some of the things that [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=416.56s)]
*  already occurred when these tariffs began. But we for the first time in about four years, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=420.32s)]
*  our economy contracted last quarter. If it does that two quarters in a row, you're officially [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=425.52s)]
*  in a recession. And so we are pointed that way. Now, also, we've had some good numbers on [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=430.8s)]
*  employment this week. So we'd say there's some mixed signals going on right now. But when I talk [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=435.68s)]
*  to car dealers here in Omaha, they say if these tariffs aren't revised, the average person is [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=439.92s)]
*  going to pay five thousand more dollars to buy an American car, let alone a foreign made car. But [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=445.52000000000004s)]
*  an American car will cost that much more because a lot of our parts come from all over the world. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=451.04s)]
*  I got a globally sourced manufacturing for cars and many other things. I have many businesses, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=456.4s)]
*  just like Josh was saying, they're probably going to go out of business if this doesn't change. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  One gentleman, he has this whole store is Christmas Lights. It's one of the best Christmas [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=467.2s)]
*  lights store you'll ever see. It's a beautiful store. But all those lights come from China. So [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=472.08s)]
*  it doesn't have time to find other sources. So it may drive him out of business. And there's [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=476.96s)]
*  so many examples of this and it is creating a lot of disturbance. And if this is your livelihood, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  it's scary. And Congressman Gottheimer, yeah, this is your livelihood. This is serious and this is [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=488.08s)]
*  scary. But is this something that Democrats, just crassly politically speaking, can use to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=493.76s)]
*  their advantage to show the American people that what's coming out of the administration [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=500.48s)]
*  is indeed hurting them? Well, listen, I never want anyone to hurt. And when I'm talking to families [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=505.2s)]
*  and diners or to small business owners, they're panicked because there's chaos. There's no [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=511.44s)]
*  certainty. They don't know what's going to happen the next week. They don't know if their orders [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=516.0s)]
*  are going to come over right from overseas where they're relying on supplies and different things. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=518.96s)]
*  And so everything's frozen. And that's causing them to either say, hey, I'm either going to go [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=523.76s)]
*  out of business because I can't afford the tariffs to bring in any of the stuff I need to sell to [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=527.68s)]
*  people. They don't know what tomorrow is going to bring. And that uncertainty, that chaos, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=531.6s)]
*  obviously is having a huge impact, a freezing impact on the economy, which of course leads [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=536.64s)]
*  to recession. That's why JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have both said that we're headed [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=540.96s)]
*  toward a recession. Don pointed out the fact that their economy shrank for the first time in years [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=544.96s)]
*  last quarter, which is obviously not the direction you want to be going in. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=551.2800000000001s)]
*  And I don't know who President Trump was talking to from the financial world who says things are [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=555.6s)]
*  good. But there's no way to look at any of this stuff and say we're heading in the right direction [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=561.44s)]
*  when prices are shooting up and retirement savings are crashing. And the stress that's putting on [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=564.96s)]
*  people, especially seniors who are worried about Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to begin [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=570.32s)]
*  with, right? I just got a lot of people, parents and seniors and others who were saying to me, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=574.48s)]
*  I don't know what tomorrow is going to bring here. And I'm very concerned with my economic future. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=580.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to retire when I thought I was going to retire. So that's what I'm hearing out there. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=584.8000000000001s)]
*  And I'm sure Don's hearing a lot of the same. We've got to turn this around. This cannot go [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=588.1600000000001s)]
*  forward. It's why our legislation is key. It's time to actually, it's one thing to be tough on [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=592.5600000000001s)]
*  China. It's another thing to be tough on our key trading allies and send prices up here. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=596.4s)]
*  AARON MATEFIELD, President of the United States of America [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=601.1999999999999s)]
*  Really quickly, before we let you guys go, I want to look at President Trump talking about [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=602.4s)]
*  protecting Medicaid over and over and over again and then get your reaction, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=606.64s)]
*  Representative Bacon, on the other side. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=609.52s)]
*  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States of America [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=610.9599999999999s)]
*  One of the things that's very important will be saving Medicaid for Americans in need. So, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=613.36s)]
*  just remember, we will be saving Medicaid and strengthening it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=618.8s)]
*  We will defend Medicaid for those great people that are in need. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=623.04s)]
*  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States of America [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  We're going to pass the largest tax cuts in American history, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=627.36s)]
*  and we will not cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid benefits. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=632.7199999999999s)]
*  AARON MATEFIELD, President of the United States of America [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  Congressman Bacon, according to Politico, you told the White House you wouldn't accept [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=639.12s)]
*  more than a $500 billion, $500 billion in reductions to Medicaid. And I guess I'm curious, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  are you worried that what the president is doing that's putting the Republicans in a bind when [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=652.0s)]
*  they're looking to cut things over and over and over again and when you have the American people [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=657.44s)]
*  saying, don't touch our Medicaid? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=662.48s)]
*  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States of America [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=663.92s)]
*  Well, in this case, I wish more Republicans in the House would listen to President Trump. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=665.52s)]
*  When I said $500 billion, Politico sort of got the quote right, not quite, though. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=670.16s)]
*  AARON MATEFIELD, President of the United States of America [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=674.56s)]
*  What exactly was the quote? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=675.2s)]
*  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States of America [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=676.48s)]
*  What exactly was the quote? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=676.88s)]
*  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States of America [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=677.68s)]
*  If you do work requirements and you do an eligibility check and only [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=677.76s)]
*  people here legally can be on Medicaid, that saves you by $500 billion, according to the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=682.64s)]
*  Congressional Budget Office. So I'm not proposing any cuts to the Medicare or Medicaid, the people [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=688.64s)]
*  that are needed that they have to get or the hospitals. But if you do work requirements [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=694.56s)]
*  for able-bodied adults, eligibility checks, you save about $500 billion. And most Americans agree [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=699.3599999999999s)]
*  with that, by the way. And I just think President Trump is in that same boat where I'm at. The [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=705.5999999999999s)]
*  problem is we have a few people in our House that want to go much more than that. And that's [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=710.32s)]
*  probably ground zero right now between factions of the House right now trying to get an agreement. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=716.0s)]
*  And we don't want to really cut taxes more. We're just trying to extend the tax cuts that we had. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=721.7600000000001s)]
*  If we don't extend them, it's going to be a 20 percent tax increase, and that's not good either. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=727.2s)]
*  So I think what I'm proposing is fair. I've seen polling where 80 percent of Americans [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=732.24s)]
*  agree with work requirements for able-bodied people that don't have small children. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=738.4s)]
*  There's some smart things we could do here that we can meet in the middle and get an agreement. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=743.76s)]
*  I just hope that other Republicans are listening to President Trump. He says he doesn't want Medicaid [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=748.0s)]
*  cut. Congresswoman Josh Gottheimer, Don Bacon, thank you so much for joining us on our launch [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=751.68s)]
*  weekend. We really appreciate your time. Thank you. Congrats. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=758.0799999999999s)]
*  you [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtBVB8GJgM&t=768.4s)]
