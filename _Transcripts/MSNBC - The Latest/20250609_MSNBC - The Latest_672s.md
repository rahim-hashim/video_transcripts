Video Description: Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration raids. Bypassing Gavin Newsom, Trump’s move is the first time a president has used federal troops in this way without the permission of a state governor since the civil rights movement. MSNBC’s Ari Melber and Politico's Ankush Khardori discuss. (The Beat's YouTube playlist: https://msnbc.com/ari Ari: / arimelber Beat merch: www.msnbc.com/Beat5)

# Troops in the streets! Ari Melber on Trump courting legal showdown in L.A.
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU)
*  We are covering what's been happening in LA in an ongoing story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=0.0s)]
*  The president is clearly trying to test the bounds of the law and going beyond over half [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  a century of precedent, deploying these National Guard troops in LA with his stated reasons, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=8.9s)]
*  including what they call ISIS authority and public security, but also with another agenda. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=14.32s)]
*  We have these live pictures from LA. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=19.82s)]
*  Trump did not collaborate or cooperate with the state governor, where there's usually [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=21.72s)]
*  exercise dual authority in the use of the National Guard. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=26.66s)]
*  Instead, he invoked a statute which he asserts, and this could be ultimately confirmed or [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=30.14s)]
*  denied in court, but his team says that gives them the ability to call these units into [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=37.46s)]
*  this type of federal service. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=42.42s)]
*  That U.S. code, though, requires an invasion or rebellion or a situation where the president [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=44.34s)]
*  cannot faithfully execute the laws through regular forces. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  Now, Trump has said the protests are prohibiting ICE from doing what they need to do. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=53.94s)]
*  They're lawful duties, and that thus meets the definition of a, quote, rebellion. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=58.699999999999996s)]
*  Now, there just isn't a lot of case law to support that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=63.66s)]
*  So courts can decide anything. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=66.82s)]
*  They also can sometimes duck cases that they don't want to take. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=69.38s)]
*  But in the modern era, there is not good case law or precedent for that claim. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=72.62s)]
*  The New York Times notes the statute itself does not confer authority to use federal troops [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=77.58s)]
*  in the way that Trump wants, and that no president has done this without the permission of state [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=82.38000000000001s)]
*  governors since the civil rights movement, the precedent we mentioned, which, again, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=87.22s)]
*  cuts against Trump because there was literally years of lead-up to that ultimate use without [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=92.38000000000001s)]
*  the governor rather than what really exploded over the weekend with the Trump administration [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=98.18s)]
*  deciding to make a point here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=102.9s)]
*  Now, Trump also discussed and sometimes backed down on his musings or assertions to aides [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=104.58000000000001s)]
*  that he wanted to use the military more forcefully, including to break up protests. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=111.94s)]
*  It's also something that a previous guest mentioned tonight that he talked about on [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=116.94s)]
*  the campaign trail. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=120.1s)]
*  One of the other things I'll do, because you know you're supposed to not be involved [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=122.98s)]
*  in that, you just have to be asked by the governor or the mayor to come in. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=126.98s)]
*  The next time, I'm not waiting. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=132.1s)]
*  That was March 2023. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=136.62s)]
*  It was on his mind. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=139.82s)]
*  We've all seen Donald Trump, the reality show star, the entertainer, and the claims [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=141.74s)]
*  and defenses around him that everything is a joke or he doesn't know exactly what he's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=147.82000000000002s)]
*  doing, or he just floats ideas. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=151.70000000000002s)]
*  Here you actually see on the record the opposite. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=154.38s)]
*  Reliable claims from senior leaders, including in military and law enforcement in the federal [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=157.3s)]
*  administration, last time saying he tried to do this stuff. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=161.34s)]
*  Then you have him on the campaign trail musing about it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=166.74s)]
*  I'm not waiting. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=168.54000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to do it without the governor. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=169.54000000000002s)]
*  Also showing that he's aware of that general tradition, not that you can never take an [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=171.06s)]
*  exception but the tradition, long standing, that you don't do it without the governor [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=177.86s)]
*  and this time he's not waiting. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=181.38s)]
*  So California is trying to push back into courts while dealing with the emergency. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=183.22s)]
*  They are arguing that judges should rule against Trump on the idea that he basically infringed [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=188.0s)]
*  on California legal rule or the federalism, the two types of power that we have in this [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=193.5s)]
*  country, something we reported on in this very program. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=199.42s)]
*  Governor Newsom says, in his view, the whole thing is federal illegal powers by Trump. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=201.82s)]
*  Specifically notes and under what the DOD did is they had to coordinate with the governor [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=210.14s)]
*  of the state. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=215.18s)]
*  They never coordinate with the governor of the state. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=216.18s)]
*  There's a protocol. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=217.82s)]
*  There's a process. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=218.82s)]
*  He didn't care about that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=219.82s)]
*  It's Orwellian. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=220.82s)]
*  Simply lying to people. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=221.82s)]
*  Unconstitutional, illegal act. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=223.82s)]
*  His mess. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  They're trying to clean it up. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=227.58s)]
*  Now that is the governor's view. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=230.54000000000002s)]
*  Some of this comes down to truth. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=233.24s)]
*  In other words, was there coordination? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=235.82000000000002s)]
*  Did that truly happen or not? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  The governor says no. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=240.38000000000002s)]
*  Trump and his aides have suggested otherwise. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=242.06s)]
*  The governor said he's a quote, stone cold liar. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=243.98000000000002s)]
*  Trump has been caught making many falsehoods, but we're going to need a little more evidence [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=246.70000000000002s)]
*  and reporting which may come up in court about whether the governor is right. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=251.34s)]
*  If he is, that could cut against Trump in court. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=256.56s)]
*  And remember, national guard is this quasi thing. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=259.68s)]
*  It's this hybrid state federal thing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=262.96s)]
*  But if a judge or a senior federal court says you don't follow this order or this order [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=264.56s)]
*  is unlawful from the president, well then that's the end of that until and unless the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=271.4s)]
*  Supreme Court intervenes. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=275.24s)]
*  So we might learn more about this in short order. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=276.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump wants the Pentagon to dispatch personnel potentially anywhere for these laws. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=279.4s)]
*  We mentioned this earlier in the broadcast. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=286.34s)]
*  This is very important because some experts see that as a chilling sign that this is not [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=287.53999999999996s)]
*  a one-off in California this weekend, but a test case where Trump is, quote, prepared [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=292.32s)]
*  to send troops into other cities in response to protests. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=296.34s)]
*  Take it all together and keep in mind that while there were incidents of violence and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  there certainly have been physical clashes over deportation and ICE authorities, we've [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=305.85999999999996s)]
*  covering that, what we are talking about at its core is the first right that's in the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=312.74s)]
*  Constitution and not one that's very confused or debatable. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=318.74s)]
*  The very First Amendment, the right to speech and the right to peacefully assemble. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=322.94s)]
*  And there is no precedent in the modern era that has ever held up that you can go and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=327.86s)]
*  take people's peaceful speech and protests and send in the troops. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=333.14s)]
*  If that's what they have in mind on a repeat basis, well, they have in mind a very different [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=337.54s)]
*  country. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=341.42s)]
*  We're joined by a former federal prosecutor, Ankush Kordhuri, who knows these issues well [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=342.42s)]
*  and now writes about them for Politico. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=346.14000000000004s)]
*  Welcome and point blank, how extreme are these measures that the president has chosen to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=348.18s)]
*  take over the weekend and what is the likelihood that they may be unlawful? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=354.22s)]
*  I think they're quite extreme, very disproportionate and pretextual, I think, at least given the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=358.98s)]
*  stated rationale. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=365.94s)]
*  In terms of the likelihood of a successful court challenge, that's really unclear to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=368.02s)]
*  me. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=372.34s)]
*  As you've noted, there's not a lot of precedent, at least in our lifetimes, for a situation [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=373.34s)]
*  like this. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  It's not like there's a clear roadmap for a court to pick up a case like this and figure [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=377.65999999999997s)]
*  out what the standards should be, what kind of evidence should be admitted, what is the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=381.21999999999997s)]
*  relevant information that should be induced. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=383.94s)]
*  Courts generally, I think, try to avoid weighing in on issues like this, on the theory that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=387.78s)]
*  the executive branch is more competent to deal with these sorts of military issues than [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=391.9s)]
*  they are. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=396.06s)]
*  Of course, you have a broader issue, which is, could a court even intervene quickly enough [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=397.1s)]
*  to issue some sort of order that would put a halt to this, or will it all kind of blow [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=401.38s)]
*  over, ideally blow over quickly and before a court needs to step in? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=404.42s)]
*  There are a lot of issues hanging around here. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=410.14s)]
*  I think, though, to me, the clearest and most dispositive issue is that there is not a rebellion [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=411.5s)]
*  in Los Angeles. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=418.4s)]
*  That's the statutory predicate for the administration's actions. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=419.76s)]
*  There are other arguments that California has raised, but to me, that's the critical [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=424.02000000000004s)]
*  one. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=427.02000000000004s)]
*  There's not a rebellion. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=428.02000000000004s)]
*  There just simply isn't. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=429.02000000000004s)]
*  There are a bunch of protests. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=430.02000000000004s)]
*  There's some sporadic violence, which is illegal, and we should police appropriately, but that's [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=431.02000000000004s)]
*  not the same thing as a rebellion. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=436.1s)]
*  Yeah, there's no rebellion, and there isn't even the scale of protests that gets into [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=438.22s)]
*  mass safety issues, which, while not a rebellion, raise harder questions, which America has [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=443.42s)]
*  seen. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=449.42s)]
*  There's been mass protests sometimes in more than one city. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=451.3s)]
*  We've had marches on Washington. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=453.58000000000004s)]
*  We've had gatherings that go for days in some places at a higher scale than this, and then [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=455.38s)]
*  you have tougher questions of law enforcement that still don't reach the level of saying [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=460.98s)]
*  it's a rebellion. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=465.02000000000004s)]
*  I do want to draw your attention and viewers to the legal setbacks that the administration [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=466.22s)]
*  has faced, because they've dialed this up over the weekend right after yielding to a [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=471.1s)]
*  Supreme Court ruling formally on Friday in a process that took some time, but where the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=476.65999999999997s)]
*  administration returned, Abrego Garcia, who had been mistakenly deported to the wrong [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=482.09999999999997s)]
*  country, that wasn't even in dispute. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=488.06s)]
*  The question was whether they would follow the Supreme Court order to facilitate his [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=490.02s)]
*  return. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=493.82s)]
*  And so then over this weekend, having yielded in one place where they comply with a court [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=494.82s)]
*  order, and that is the actual legal outcome of what had been quite a serious matter that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=499.62s)]
*  went all the way up to the Supreme Court with a seven to two loss, they turn around and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=505.38s)]
*  on the weekend have something where they can look like and in some sense be on, quote, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=509.5s)]
*  offense or pushing other powers. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=514.98s)]
*  As a student of how this all works, who's also been inside the executive branch yourself [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=518.22s)]
*  in a certain way, do you think there's a link here, and do you think that that's part of [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=524.3s)]
*  the problem of the endless theatrics of the Trump administration they didn't want much [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=528.98s)]
*  time or attention on what ultimately turned out to be them yielding to the high court? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=533.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think that you've touched on two very important issues, I think. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=538.4s)]
*  One is that this sort of legal strategy is consistent with a strategy we've seen repeatedly [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=543.24s)]
*  since the start of this administration with concerns invoking these emergency powers, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=548.48s)]
*  these obscure laws, in order to deal with problems that are not emergencies. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=552.8s)]
*  We saw this when they invoked trade deficits as an emergency for the tariff framework. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=556.92s)]
*  That was rejected recently by the Court of International Trade, but that's up on appeal. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=562.24s)]
*  In the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and a bunch of the other deportations, there's been [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=566.12s)]
*  this claim that the Alien Enemies Act should be invoked or has properly been invoked because [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=570.12s)]
*  we're somehow at war with or engaged in hostilities with Venezuela or trending Aragua, which is [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=574.44s)]
*  simply not true. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=579.6400000000001s)]
*  This is a very problematic trend for a democracy, having emergency powers laws being invoked [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=581.36s)]
*  so regularly and almost becoming the norm. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=585.5200000000001s)]
*  The second thing I would say concerning sort of the politics around this is that there [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=588.3s)]
*  is plenty of reason for Trump to want to draw attention away from what is going on in the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=592.42s)]
*  rest of his administration. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=597.26s)]
*  He promised the economy would improve quickly after he came into office. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=599.66s)]
*  That has not happened. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=602.8599999999999s)]
*  He promised he would end two different wars quickly after he came into office. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=603.8599999999999s)]
*  That has not happened. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=607.42s)]
*  He promised that his tariffs would bring along an economic resurgence. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=608.56s)]
*  That has not happened, and the 90 deals in 90 days have not remotely emerged. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=611.9799999999999s)]
*  The bill, that big beautiful bill that's moving through Congress, is on the bubble now because [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=617.0600000000001s)]
*  the Senate, it's not clear that he'll be able to keep all the Republicans in line in the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=622.02s)]
*  Senate. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=625.54s)]
*  We shall see. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=626.54s)]
*  So he has faced a number of challenges on his core, on many of his core political promises. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=627.54s)]
*  This is the one, immigration, where he's gotten some traction and he's chosen now to escalate [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=632.66s)]
*  this in an area where there's very little for the other branches to do, at least quickly, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=637.82s)]
*  in the way of putting in some sort of breaks on the process. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNvTnPF3zOU&t=642.6800000000001s)]
