# Keisha Lance Bottoms would ‘push back against the chaos in the White House’ as Governor
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE)
*  My grandmama taught me no matter how hard they swing, you never stay down. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=0.0s)]
*  You fight back. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=5.8s)]
*  That's why I'm running for governor. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=7.36s)]
*  Because Georgia families deserve far better than what Donald Trump and Republicans are [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=9.26s)]
*  giving us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=14.34s)]
*  That was former mayor of Atlanta and former advisor to President Joe Biden, Keisha Lance [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=16.7s)]
*  Bottoms, making her case to be the next governor of Georgia. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=21.48s)]
*  If she wins, she would not only become the first Democratic governor elected in the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=25.5s)]
*  state in more than two decades, she would also be the state's and the nation's first [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=30.18s)]
*  black female governor. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=36.28s)]
*  One more data point. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=38.54s)]
*  She would be only the fourth black person ever elected governor in the United States. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=40.16s)]
*  And joining us now is Keisha Lance Bottoms. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=47.74s)]
*  Madam Mayor, welcome to the weekend. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=51.58s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=54.42s)]
*  It's great to see you all. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=55.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=57.22s)]
*  The first question is the basic question. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=58.22s)]
*  Why are you running? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=60.64s)]
*  Well, I am at least the fifth generation Georgian. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  That's as far back as we can trace our family to a plantation in Crawfordville, Georgia. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=67.92s)]
*  And for me, November was a turning point. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=72.9s)]
*  I know it was for people across this country, but I found myself wondering what am I to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=75.86s)]
*  do in this moment? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=82.22s)]
*  What can I do in this moment? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=83.84s)]
*  This state has meant so much to my family, so many opportunities throughout the generations. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=86.0s)]
*  And that's what we want for all of our families in Georgia. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=91.72s)]
*  I served as mayor for three years under Donald Trump, 1.0. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=94.72s)]
*  So I know what it means to have solid leadership that will push back against the chaos that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=99.9s)]
*  he is spewing from the White House. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=105.88s)]
*  How do you present yourself as not just kind of a check on or an opposition to Donald Trump, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  but also an alternative, right? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  A reason, giving people a reason to vote for you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  People care about what's happening in their families, in their communities. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=122.0s)]
*  People want to be able to put food on their table. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=125.78s)]
*  They want to be able to put gas in their car. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=127.92s)]
*  We're focusing on issues that are important to Georgia families. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=130.9s)]
*  We are one of nine states that have not expanded Medicaid, leaving $710 million on the table. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=136.6s)]
*  Nine rural hospitals have closed in this state, supporting our small businesses. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  Nearly half of our employees in this state are employed by small businesses. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=150.12s)]
*  That's important. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=154.68s)]
*  Also proposing that we eliminate state income taxes for our teachers. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=155.92s)]
*  We have a shortage of teachers. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  We are having difficulty retaining and attracting teachers. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=163.26s)]
*  So the bottom line will be to focus on those issues that matter to Georgians. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  And unfortunately, with the chaos that's coming out of the White House, we're not getting [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=173.66s)]
*  the support that we need in the state. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=178.42s)]
*  Take for example, our report says Savannah and Brunswick. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  600,000 jobs in this state are directly related to those ports. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=184.34s)]
*  And with the chaos with the tariffs, that's impacting people's bottom line in this state. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=189.34s)]
*  Madam Mayor, Donald Trump has withheld his endorsement so far, but do you see him getting [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=195.66s)]
*  involved and politically that actually could be advantageous to you, couldn't it? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=203.18s)]
*  Because he seems unlikely to endorse the Lieutenant Governor Chris Carr, who was not an election [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=208.38s)]
*  denier, and he seems more likely to endorse U.S. Congressman Buddy Carter. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=215.02s)]
*  So Chris Carr is actually the attorney general on the Republican side. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=222.62s)]
*  I doubt that he'll be endorsing me in this race, but there's going to be a lot of attention [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=228.74s)]
*  on Georgia. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=236.94s)]
*  Of course, Senator Ossoff is on the ballot again, and we know that there's going to be [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=237.94s)]
*  a lot of attention on this state because it can obviously impact the Senate, which is [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=242.1s)]
*  important. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=248.74s)]
*  And Donald Trump has personal reasons to keep his eyes on Georgia. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=250.34s)]
*  So I expect that we're going to see a lot of Donald Trump. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=255.85999999999999s)]
*  Whether or not that helps or hurts any candidate, we'll see. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=259.34s)]
*  I'm going to focus on my race and talking directly to the people of Georgia about what [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=263.42s)]
*  I can do as governor to make their lives better. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=268.3s)]
*  So, Madam Mayor, talk to us about why you think you can win. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=272.06s)]
*  And I ask this question because I want to put up the Georgia presidential election results [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=275.58000000000004s)]
*  from 2020 and 2024. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=281.38s)]
*  In the 2020 race, President Biden eked out a victory in the state over Donald Trump by [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=283.58000000000004s)]
*  0.3 percentage points. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=289.98s)]
*  But then four years later in the race against then Vice President Harris, he got more than [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=292.62s)]
*  50 percent of the vote. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  And so when you run for governor, how are you going to change that around? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=300.48s)]
*  How are you going to convince Georgians to make you the next governor? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, I'm used to close races. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=309.88s)]
*  Jonathan, when I won my election for mayor, it was by around 800 votes. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  So we know we are accustomed to these very close races in Georgia. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  But in 2020, we did a lot of work on the ground. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  There was a lot of knocking on doors. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=327.12s)]
*  We covered all the bases. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=328.9s)]
*  And that's what we will continue to do. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=330.67999999999995s)]
*  And if you think about Senators Warnock and Ossoff, we were able to send Warnock back [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=333.21999999999997s)]
*  to the Senate, I think at least three times at this point because of the multiple special [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=338.52s)]
*  multiple elections and runoffs, et cetera. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=345.17999999999995s)]
*  So it's possible in this state, even with the vice president's loss in Georgia, it was [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=348.2s)]
*  still around 100000 votes. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  So we know how to get it done. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=355.56s)]
*  We know how to knock on doors. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=357.0s)]
*  We know how to get people on the phone. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=358.48s)]
*  We know how to reach you via social media. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=359.98s)]
*  We're going to cover all the bases and go into communities and speak directly to people [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=362.38s)]
*  about what concerns them and what they want to see from leadership in this state. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=367.78s)]
*  Marakeesha Lance Bottoms, thank you very much for coming on. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=373.46s)]
*  We will be watching that race. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=377.22s)]
*  We'll have to do it again as things get closer. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzCXLK78PE&t=378.62s)]
