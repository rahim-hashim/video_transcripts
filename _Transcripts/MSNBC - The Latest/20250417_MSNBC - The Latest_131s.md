# Senator Van Hollen meets with Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks)
*  I hope to meet with representatives of the government. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=0.0s)]
*  I hope to have the chance to actually see Kilmar and see what his condition is. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=3.0s)]
*  That was Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen when he was on his way to El Salvador yesterday, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=9.0s)]
*  saying one of the main goals of his visit was to essentially do a wellness check on this constituent of his [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=14.0s)]
*  that the Trump administration said it mistakenly shipped to El Salvador [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=20.0s)]
*  and then said they couldn't or wouldn't try to get him back. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=24.0s)]
*  Well, earlier in the show tonight we had the breaking news that Senator Van Hollen has accomplished at least that stated goal. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=27.0s)]
*  He was initially turned away from this prison in El Salvador today, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=33.0s)]
*  but then hours later the El Salvadoran government arranged for Mr. Obrego Garcia to get out of the prison [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=37.0s)]
*  in order to meet Senator Van Hollen somewhat bizarrely in civilian clothes at a hotel in San Salvador. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=42.0s)]
*  Now, we do not have a sense of what this is going to mean for Mr. Obrego Garcia overall. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=50.0s)]
*  His lawyer tells us tonight he's just learning this meeting happened from social media like the rest of us are learning it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=55.0s)]
*  El Salvador's president just posted online that Mr. Obrego Garcia will now stay in El Salvador's custody. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=60.0s)]
*  But again, it is the U.S. government that has been ordered by U.S. courts to get Mr. Obrego Garcia back to the United States. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=67.0s)]
*  So we shall see. We did just obtain this statement from Mr. Obrego Garcia's wife. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=73.0s)]
*  She says, quote, My children and my prayers have been answered. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=78.0s)]
*  The efforts of my family and community in fighting for justice are being heard because I now know that my husband is alive. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=81.0s)]
*  God is listening and the community is standing strong. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=87.0s)]
*  We still have so many questions, hopes and fears. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=89.0s)]
*  I will continue praying and fighting for Kilmar's return home. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=91.0s)]
*  Thank you to everyone, including Senator Van Hollen, my CASA family, all our unions, faith leaders and community [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=94.0s)]
*  for continuing this fight for my family to be reunited. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=100.0s)]
*  We are just learning about this situation as it unfolds. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=105.0s)]
*  This hour, we'll bring you whatever new information we get as we get it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=107.0s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQ86tghKks&t=110.0s)]
