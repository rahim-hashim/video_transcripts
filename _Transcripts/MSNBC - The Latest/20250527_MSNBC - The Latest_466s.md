# Demoted Musk’s costly agenda: Melber and Erin Brockovich on deregulation risks
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU)
*  Erin Brockovich is a consumer advocate, environmental activist, and she has a sub stack, the Brockovich [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=0.0s)]
*  Report where she hosts weekly live chats. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=6.28s)]
*  You can find that by Googling or going online. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=8.72s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=11.56s)]
*  Hi, Ari. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=12.56s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=13.56s)]
*  I have many questions, but we did the setup. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=16.16s)]
*  So I'll give you the floor first. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=18.76s)]
*  What are you thinking and seeing right now? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=20.84s)]
*  Well, I did watch your setup, if you will. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  My hands started sweating because I'm pretty frustrated about the situation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=28.680000000000003s)]
*  And if you're going to talk about deregulations, some people might not like the response that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=32.6s)]
*  I have. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=37.32s)]
*  I'm not going to overreact to the deregulations. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=38.56s)]
*  We've been here before. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=42.36s)]
*  We've seen it before. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=44.2s)]
*  But my frustration is about regulations. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=46.3s)]
*  And I've had a unique experience since the film came out and staying in my career for [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=51.160000000000004s)]
*  30 years through seven administrations. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=55.4s)]
*  There's issues here on both sides of the aisle. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=59.48s)]
*  And the political leadership can lend to more problems. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=62.96s)]
*  They can be as guilty of kicking a can down the line as a corporation can. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=67.88s)]
*  And what I've observed in 30 years over and over and over again, even when we have regulations [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=73.36s)]
*  with no oversight, they're worthless. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=81.24s)]
*  And if these regulations had been working all this time, you and I would not be sitting [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=84.88s)]
*  here having this conversation 30 years into it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=90.08s)]
*  Well, we might, because I love the movie. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=94.96s)]
*  So any excuse to book you? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  When I take your deeper point. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, let's ask about the—let me ask you about the corporate side, because we showed [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=103.36s)]
*  that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=109.2s)]
*  Even if you don't do a human accounting, even by just financial accounting, when they get [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=110.76s)]
*  caught, it would have been better for them, cheaper, to do it right from the jump. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=115.92s)]
*  So is your concern then that no matter who's president, not enough of them are getting [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=121.48s)]
*  caught, so they look at it, if they're being inhuman or unethical, however you want to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=126.44s)]
*  call it, they look at it as just gambling because they'll get away with the other stuff? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=130.08s)]
*  Well, somebody's not learning their lesson. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=134.04s)]
*  I believe that there's kind of an old corporate theory in play that plays itself out politically [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=138.36s)]
*  and within our regulatory bodies as well. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=145.28s)]
*  And that was the Ford Pinto theory. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=148.28s)]
*  Not everybody's old enough to know that one. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=150.08s)]
*  I am. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=151.88000000000002s)]
*  Hello. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  Where they have the gasoline tank in the back, and when you rear ended it, it blew up. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=153.88000000000002s)]
*  But the company's decision was it was cheaper to run it and face the litigations than fix [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  the problem. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=162.8s)]
*  We have a huge problem here in this country with failing infrastructure. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=164.16s)]
*  Every situation I've been involved in, I could go to all the fires, we could go to the water [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=171.98s)]
*  systems, we could go to lead in the water, we can talk about forever chemicals, we can [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=177.16s)]
*  go all the way back to Hinckley, began with infrastructure failures. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  And then having regulations and then having no oversight, we continue to repeat the pattern. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=189.28s)]
*  And we're in a place now, Ari, this is not serving us. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=195.56s)]
*  And moving forward, I want the highway or your way, my way, no way, all the finger pointing, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=200.0s)]
*  which we've been doing for decades, hasn't changed a thing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=208.84s)]
*  We need to address regulations and oversight of those regulations. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=212.44s)]
*  I'm not going to overreact to deregulation. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=218.52s)]
*  So one good thing about that is we're having this conversation again. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=221.0s)]
*  And what I hope on all time is about infrastructure. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=225.76s)]
*  Where's our plans? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=230.92s)]
*  How are we going to implement them? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=232.32s)]
*  Because if we're not realistic, we're not changing out these infrastructures, we're [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=234.06s)]
*  not changing out all our lead lines, we're not changing out all our utilities, our grids [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=238.04s)]
*  aren't up to snuff, if you will. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=243.88s)]
*  If we aren't realistic about the time change that's going to require, we've wasted time [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  already because it won't be tomorrow. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=251.04s)]
*  We need to start being prepared. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=253.48s)]
*  And we are perfectly capable of doing that, whether it's through your own observation, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=256.88s)]
*  reports, getting to know your water, getting your water quality reports, following up on [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=263.88s)]
*  what regulations are or aren't, has anybody had oversight? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=269.48s)]
*  And it's a multi-pronged approach getting to where we need to be. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=274.2s)]
*  But if we continue to just stay in this stuck argument, it's deregulations, they're a problem, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=278.46s)]
*  regulations, no oversight, blaming the other party or this party, we're not going to get [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=285.68s)]
*  where we need to go. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=290.7s)]
*  So I'm super frustrated. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=292.20000000000005s)]
*  I get it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=293.72s)]
*  And I bet some people listening would be frustrated about a lot of aspects of this, and you put [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=295.88s)]
*  the work in. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=298.92s)]
*  Let me play a little bit of Elon Musk. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=299.92s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=301.04s)]
*  Regulations basically should be default gone, default gone, not default there, default gone. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=302.04s)]
*  And if it turns out that we missed the mark on the regulation, we always add it back in. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't think adding it back in would work well for the people you've represented. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=316.44s)]
*  And then I'm curious how you as an advocate feel in what seems a little bit like a dystopian [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=320.64s)]
*  kind of obvious movie plot where the richest person who runs the companies then has a partial [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=328.2s)]
*  role running the government that's supposed to regulate the companies. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=335.24s)]
*  That would seem to some degree different than decades ago. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=338.5s)]
*  But your thoughts? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=341.2s)]
*  Well, it is. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=342.2s)]
*  It's kind of everything I've been saying. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=344.08s)]
*  We're going to go to one extreme or to the other extreme, and neither extreme is going [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  to work. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  And so I pay very close attention to what's going on out there, regulated or deregulated. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=352.04s)]
*  And where I always find where we get better is through the people, the community, and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=358.6s)]
*  the action they take combined with the support of the law. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=367.76s)]
*  They make effective changes even at a local level. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=373.32s)]
*  We believe these regulatory regulations or if we talk about forever chemicals, forever [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=377.2s)]
*  chemicals were introduced very, very long time ago. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=385.4s)]
*  The US EPA knew about them in the 90s, still let it into the stream of commerce, set a [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=388.96s)]
*  guideline based on no science, only for us to find out it's one of the biggest contaminants [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=393.92s)]
*  that we have. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=398.8s)]
*  So we've got to rethink before we let something into the marketplace, what is the science [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=401.0s)]
*  on it, and not use us as the guinea pigs. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  And that these federal rules don't affect every single state. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=411.35999999999996s)]
*  When I was involved in Hinckley, the federal oversight was nowhere to be found. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=416.32s)]
*  California has been the first state to set an MCL, a maximum contaminant limit, for a [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=421.47999999999996s)]
*  hexavalent chromium that we follow that isn't a federal guideline. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=426.48s)]
*  I want people to not overreact and bring it home to your community. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=430.64000000000004s)]
*  I'm running over on time, that's the only reason I'm jumping in, but I think your point [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=436.48s)]
*  about not overreacting but having context, you said about the guinea pig, even guinea [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=439.92s)]
*  pigs don't want to be guinea pigs. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQWuulfoXU&t=444.56s)]
