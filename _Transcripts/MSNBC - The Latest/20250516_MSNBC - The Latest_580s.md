# DHS requests 20,000 National Guard soldiers for immigration crackdown at southern border
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg)
*  Joining us now, NBC News senior White House correspondent Gabe Gutierrez in Washington, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=0.0s)]
*  NBC's senior national security correspondent Courtney Cubie at the Pentagon, our legal [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=5.16s)]
*  affairs reporter Gary Grumbach, also former federal prosecutor Barrett Berger. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=10.0s)]
*  Courtney, what more do we know about this National Guard request? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Do we know which states would be involved or what exactly the troops would be doing? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=22.76s)]
*  So we know that it made its way from the Department of Homeland Security to the Department of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=24.68s)]
*  Homeland Security. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=28.6s)]
*  And generally what happens here, Ana, is they'll sort of kick back and forth the details. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=29.6s)]
*  They'll look at what exactly it is the Department of Homeland Security is asking for, what they [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=32.88s)]
*  want these troops to do. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=36.56s)]
*  And then DOD will decide whether they have, whether legally they can actually do these [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=38.32s)]
*  things and then what troops would be the most appropriate for it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=43.28s)]
*  Now the officials we've spoken with have said we're not, they won't tell us. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=46.56s)]
*  I'm sure they know more than they will say, but they won't tell us exactly what the troops [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=49.84s)]
*  would be used for. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=52.64s)]
*  But if past is precedent, what we have seen them, specifically National Guard used for, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=55.04s)]
*  is supporting the border operations along the southern border. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=59.8s)]
*  Now remember, if they are National Guard forces on state active duty, they actually have more [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=62.64s)]
*  authority to carry out more sort of classic police missions or law enforcement missions [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=69.28s)]
*  than an active duty service member would be allowed to. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=75.6s)]
*  And that may be part of the crux here, Ana, is if in fact they are looking for service [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=78.28s)]
*  members to do more law enforcement, then they would be looking for a National Guard, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=83.0s)]
*  most likely as opposed to active duty. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=87.64s)]
*  Now you mentioned this sort of border buffer zone area, what's being called in the Pentagon [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=89.24s)]
*  the NDA or National Defense Area. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=94.2s)]
*  That's a good example where you have U.S. military who, according to officials we've [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=96.64s)]
*  spoken with, are patrolling side by side with CBP officials. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=100.64s)]
*  The military members have the authority to temporarily detain immigrants who come across [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=105.2s)]
*  the border, but they don't have the authority to be able to actually long-term detain them [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=111.44s)]
*  or arrest them. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=116.55999999999999s)]
*  They have to turn them over to DHS officials. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=117.55999999999999s)]
*  That may be, we may see more of that, but this is all with the lawyers of the Pentagon [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=120.16s)]
*  right now and it's definitely not certain that these 20,000 troops will be assigned [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  to the mission, Ana. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  Gabe, what is the White House saying about this move? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=128.76s)]
*  Well, Ana, so far no comment directly from the White House on this particular move, but [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  it should come as no surprise. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=135.72s)]
*  This is something that the Trump administration has been indicating now really since the start [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=137.12s)]
*  of the administration and even before during the campaign. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=141.76s)]
*  They see this as doubling down on their immigration-related promises that they made to voters during the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=144.64s)]
*  campaign and the White House, on top of Trump aide Stephen Miller, has been repeatedly asked [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=151.28s)]
*  why can have this continue to be a so-called national emergency if the number of illegal [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=156.4s)]
*  border crossings have dropped dramatically so much since the start of the administration. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  This does seem to be part of the plan to make this a deterrent effect and to really keep [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=167.56s)]
*  doubling down again on a campaign promise not just at the southern border, but to ramp [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=173.01999999999998s)]
*  up mass deportations from the interior of the country, Ana. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=177.6s)]
*  Barrett, is it legal to have troops do immigration enforcement? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, this again, it could be. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=186.04s)]
*  This specific issue hasn't reached the courts yet. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  It depends on what type of immigration enforcement they're actually doing, certainly turning [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=192.28s)]
*  people around in the border, effectuating regular illegal entry cases. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=196.18s)]
*  This is all more standard. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=202.98s)]
*  These trespassing cases that the administration is trying to bring now, this is where we're [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=205.26s)]
*  veering into new territory, and this is where we're seeing the courts getting involved. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=209.62s)]
*  We have one judge that struck down a number of these trespassing charges that were brought [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=213.42s)]
*  saying, there's not sufficient warning to people that they're entering one of these [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=218.58s)]
*  restricted zones. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=222.9s)]
*  There's not enough signage, so we can't charge them criminally with trespass if they didn't [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  have sufficient warning. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=230.02s)]
*  So this is where you're seeing sort of new tactics being questioned by the courts. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=231.34s)]
*  The regular, we're turning you around at the border or even bringing these illegal entry [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=235.98000000000002s)]
*  cases, probably okay. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=239.76s)]
*  Yeah, give us more of those details in terms of what the courts are saying, Gary, when [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=241.58s)]
*  this national defense area that the president has tried to designate in some parts of the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  border. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=251.72s)]
*  Specifically, I know a judge has addressed what's happening in New Mexico with the border [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=252.72s)]
*  with Mexico, and the judge is saying this may not be legally sound. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=257.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Ana. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=264.48s)]
*  So when a migrant enters the U.S. illegally from Mexico to New Mexico, they're not now [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=266.12s)]
*  just getting charged just with entering the country illegally, but also with entering [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=271.68s)]
*  this military zone. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=275.04s)]
*  But it's not a traditional military zone that you would think of like a Joint Base Andrews [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=276.72s)]
*  or a Fort Belvoir. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  It is desert, right? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  So these individuals very likely don't even know they're entering a military zone. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  That's what got this federal judge in New Mexico upset. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=287.12s)]
*  He said in part in his order, quote, the United States provides no facts from which one could [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=289.72s)]
*  reasonably conclude that the defendant knew he was entering the national defense area. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=294.14000000000004s)]
*  And he's also upset with what he called a cut and paste approach to the factual allegations [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=298.48s)]
*  in many of these cases. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=304.36s)]
*  There were no specifics as to what these individuals actually really did, just general allegations. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  Ana? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=310.92s)]
*  Okay, so we're talking about, you know, moves to add military officials to immigration enforcement. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=311.92s)]
*  We're also learning of local law enforcement being brought on board more and more to do [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=318.24s)]
*  immigration. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  The New York Times is reporting that this arrangement is overextending local resources. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=323.88000000000005s)]
*  The arrests, quote, swamped local jails. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  Public defenders said the legal system in New Mexico was facing an onslaught of cases [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=331.88000000000005s)]
*  because federal prosecutors were criminally charging nearly every person apprehended along [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  the border rather than turning them back to Mexico. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=340.72s)]
*  Barrett, what legal concerns does this raise for you? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=343.88000000000005s)]
*  Well, you hit the nail on the head. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it really is a matter of resources. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=348.12s)]
*  Does, you know, each individual office have sufficient staff to handle all of these cases? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=351.72s)]
*  And if you have people transferred into units only to deal with immigration, where are they [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  being transferred from? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=362.12s)]
*  I mean, we see this on the federal level. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=363.12s)]
*  You had AUSAs, or Assistant United States Attorneys, that were taken from offices, you [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=365.16s)]
*  know, doing gang cases, drug cases, corruption cases, all brought in to solely focus on immigration [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=370.32000000000005s)]
*  work. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=377.04s)]
*  And that is a huge change in sort of the structure of these offices. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=378.04s)]
*  And it makes you wonder, well, what's happening to all those other cases? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=381.0s)]
*  They don't simply go away just because we now have everybody focused on immigration [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=383.36s)]
*  cases. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=386.6s)]
*  I mean, it just sounds like this adds more and more chaos. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=387.6s)]
*  And immigration is such a huge, huge focus. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  Gabe, we are learning more about Stephen Miller's role in the second Trump administration. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=391.8s)]
*  How influential has he been in all of this? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, incredibly influential, Ana. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=397.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=399.68s)]
*  And according to that new NBC News reporting, he really delves more deeply into his increased [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=400.68s)]
*  role in the second Trump administration. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=405.96000000000004s)]
*  He had a lot of influence in the first Trump administration, of course. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=407.64000000000004s)]
*  But you see right there that Stephen Miller has reemerged as really untouchable, as an [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=410.48s)]
*  untouchable force in this Trump White House. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=416.12s)]
*  According to the piece, there's little question that Miller is the de facto immigration czar [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  in Trump's Washington, the man the president relies on to turn ideas into action. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  And, Ana, this comes after, you know, he had a significant rise from being a communications [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=430.32000000000005s)]
*  staffer on Capitol Hill and then working for Jeff Sessions and now really turning into [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=436.36s)]
*  the id of Donald Trump, as it's described in that article. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think what was really indicative of that was just several weeks ago when my colleague [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=446.64s)]
*  Kristen Welker spoke with President Trump and he was asked whether Stephen Miller could [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  become potentially the national security adviser to replace Mike Walz. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  And Trump came back and said that that would be a downgrade for Stephen Miller, that he's [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=459.0s)]
*  actually much higher on the totem pole than that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=464.76000000000005s)]
*  Of course, his White House deputy chief of staff title is one thing, but especially when [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  it comes to immigration, it really is clear that he is driving the train on many of this. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=470.8s)]
*  Of course, the ultimate decision is with the president. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=476.24s)]
*  But when it comes to policy, Stephen Miller is driving many of these changes to immigration [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=478.6s)]
*  and is behind the ideas behind the mass deportation policy on. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=483.44000000000005s)]
*  Courtney, you combine the military involvement with the FBI field offices now ordered to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=488.36s)]
*  make immigration a major focus, which you reported earlier this week. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=493.35999999999996s)]
*  Are there any concerns that other areas of national security will fall through the cracks? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=496.35999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  So, I mean, the reality is this Pentagon and the White House has said that border security, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=502.03999999999996s)]
*  homeland security is their primary focus when it comes to national security. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=509.4s)]
*  So I'm not surprised that they are looking to dedicate even more uniform military to [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=512.92s)]
*  this issue. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=518.64s)]
*  And candidly, Anna, I wouldn't be surprised if we see even more of this going forward [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=519.64s)]
*  in the coming months, even as Gabe pointed out that crossings along the border have dramatically [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=522.8s)]
*  fallen in the past several months. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=528.04s)]
*  But it does open up the question about their other priorities, sort of the number two and [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=530.4s)]
*  the number three. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=535.88s)]
*  China continues to be a big priority. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=536.88s)]
*  We have seen this administration pull assets out of the Pacific region to other areas, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=538.52s)]
*  to the Middle East as they have tried to battle the Houthi rebels, as they have prepared for [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=544.64s)]
*  the possibility of some sort of a potential confrontation with Iran or the proxy groups. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=548.68s)]
*  But the reality is I wouldn't be surprised if they continue to prioritize the border [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  mission and even, as I said, add more troops. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWSg2qQOHVg&t=557.04s)]
