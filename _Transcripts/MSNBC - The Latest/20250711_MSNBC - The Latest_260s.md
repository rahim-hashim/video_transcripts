# Wake up call for Trump admin? FEMA needed 'now more than ever'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s)
*  Joining me now, Jeremy Edwards, former FEMA Deputy Director of Public Affairs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=0.0s)]
*  Jeremy, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem denies there was any delay in providing resources. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=4.4s)]
*  As someone who has been behind the scenes, who knows how things operate on the ground, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=10.64s)]
*  what did you see in FEMA's response? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=15.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think, and thank you for having me on the show today, I think what I saw in FEMA's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  response is a break from a typical process that has previously allowed the agency to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  lean forward in events like this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=27.68s)]
*  And what I mean by that is when a disaster strikes or leading up to one, FEMA has a lot [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=29.76s)]
*  of autonomy and a wide latitude to be able to pre-position resources, pre-position personnel [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=34.2s)]
*  to make sure that once the state requests assistance, there's no lag time between when [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=41.0s)]
*  that request is made and when they're able to offer that assistance. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=46.56s)]
*  So based on the reporting I've seen and from conversations I've had with people inside [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=49.36s)]
*  the agency, it seems like that process has kind of put the agency on its back foot and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  slowed down some of the response efforts that they've been able to undertake. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=58.12s)]
*  And I hope that this serves as a wake-up call to the administration. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=61.72s)]
*  So for example, this reporting that $100,000, something that would cost that much, would [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=65.08s)]
*  have to first be signed off on. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=70.36s)]
*  That's new. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=72.88s)]
*  That would never have happened before. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=73.64s)]
*  There was a plan in place. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=75.64s)]
*  You responded in a certain way based on the situation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=77.64s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=81.96s)]
*  You know, this sounds like new information. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  As I said, FEMA previously has had a lot of latitude to be able to respond to these disasters, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=85.08000000000001s)]
*  get positioned materials, resources, personnel as quickly as possible. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=90.76s)]
*  And anything like this kind of amounts to a micromanagement of the agency, which does [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  not make things more efficient, does not make them more capable, does not make them FEMA [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=101.28s)]
*  flexible as we used to say. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  FEMA needs to be able to move quickly. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  The disaster costs can often run up quickly into the millions and billions of dollars. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=110.6s)]
*  So such a small amount of money that needs to be cleared every single time personally [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  by the DHS secretary, who seemingly has her hands full with a lot of other stuff, would [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=120.24s)]
*  undoubtedly slow down the process that FEMA needs to respond to these disasters. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=124.56s)]
*  FEMA, as you know, has faced calls for reform for decades. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump administration officials have even pushed to eliminate the agency. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=133.2s)]
*  And he raised the possibility that could happen with the argument they want states [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=137.56s)]
*  to lead their own responses. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=141.72s)]
*  The Washington Post is reporting today from multiple administration officials, FEMA is [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=143.96s)]
*  not now potentially going to be outright abolished. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=148.8s)]
*  But is there a way to go about improving nationwide disaster response? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=152.76s)]
*  And does that involve putting more in the hands of states? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=158.24s)]
*  Look, I think I want to touch on a couple things here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  First and foremost is that disaster response has always been led and managed by the states [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=165.92s)]
*  and executed at a local level. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=171.04s)]
*  FEMA has always been a support agency. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=173.04s)]
*  So this idea that they are going to return disaster response to the states is a fiction [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  because it already happens that way. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=180.12s)]
*  Second, I think I'd be the first one to say that, and others who have worked for the agency, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=182.04s)]
*  there are ways that we can improve FEMA assistance. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=186.84s)]
*  And the previous administrator, Administrator Criswell, who I worked with closely on the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=189.56s)]
*  ground in many disasters and helping her for interviews like these, had taken a lot of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=193.72s)]
*  actions to make FEMA's recovery efforts the way that people can get assistance more streamlined [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=198.28s)]
*  and more efficient. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=204.48s)]
*  So I think what this disaster shows is that FEMA is needed now more than ever. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=205.6s)]
*  And I am glad to see that the administration has backed off this idea that they are going to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=210.92s)]
*  get rid of the agency because people need FEMA now more than ever. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  So I think that any steps they can take to improve the recovery process for individuals, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=218.44s)]
*  to make getting that assistance easier, is going to be welcomed by anybody. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=223.56s)]
*  But any action that they want to take to diminish or shrink the agency or outright abolish it [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=227.24s)]
*  are not going to be well received or are going to hurt survivors ultimately. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=233.24s)]
*  Jeremy Edwards, thank you for being on the program. Appreciate it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=236.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIJDNbIsN4s&t=253.56s)]
