# ‘War on tourism’: Trump set to cost U.S. billions as foreign tourists stay clear
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw)
*  For the first time in nearly four decades, the Olympics are returning to Los Angeles, California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=0.0s)]
*  Today we got to look at where many of the venues for the 2028 Summer Games will be, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=5.0s)]
*  from Long Beach to Pasadena, Dodger Stadium, even the Universal Studios lot. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=9.0s)]
*  Now, this is a big deal because when the world's biggest sport event comes to your country, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=14.0s)]
*  you get a lot of tourists, a ton of revenue, global prestige that comes with hosting the games. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=18.0s)]
*  Last year's Paris Olympics had more than 11 million paying visitors, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=23.0s)]
*  and of course many more TV viewers watching and saying themselves, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=27.0s)]
*  you know, we should visit Paris sometime. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=30.0s)]
*  And under normal circumstances, L.A. could expect to see similar benefits. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=32.0s)]
*  Last year, officials predicted the L.A. Olympics could generate $7 billion in revenue, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=36.0s)]
*  with a significant chunk of that coming from foreign tourists. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=40.0s)]
*  But circumstances aren't exactly normal, are they? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=44.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's entire schtick as president is that America is being ripped off by foreigners, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=47.0s)]
*  and we're kicking people out, not letting people in. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=53.0s)]
*  Heck, we've canceled the visas of more than a thousand foreign students in U.S. colleges, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=56.0s)]
*  let many of them be hunted down for deportation with no due process. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=61.0s)]
*  Our Secretary of State Marco Rubio says, if you think the wrong way, we don't really need you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=64.0s)]
*  Listen to this, visiting America is not an entitlement, he writes, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=70.0s)]
*  it is a privilege extended to those who respect our laws and values. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=73.0s)]
*  It's policy, born out of the general MAGA worldview, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=79.0s)]
*  that says that foreigners are taking from our society without contributing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=83.0s)]
*  Here's a thing to remember, since we're also in this trade war that might crater the American economy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=87.0s)]
*  America has always run a huge trade surplus with the rest of the world in one particular industry. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=92.0s)]
*  Tourism to America, right? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=98.0s)]
*  People have always wanted to visit the United States, they come from all over the world, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=102.0s)]
*  and they visit our institutions and our shops and our museums and eat in our restaurants and stay in our hotels. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=106.0s)]
*  The U.S. travel industry says it generated $1.3 trillion last year and supported 15 million American jobs. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=112.0s)]
*  That's not just from foreign families on holiday. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=119.0s)]
*  Much of it also comes from an educational system that was the envy of the world until a couple of months ago. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=122.0s)]
*  Because the world also sends its budding scientists and engineers and doctors to America to get educated, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=128.0s)]
*  and then Americans, again, take their tuition dollars, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=134.0s)]
*  This is one of those places where the flow of dollars go from the foreigners to the Americans. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=137.0s)]
*  We also get the benefit of incredibly smart people coming to our country, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=143.0s)]
*  where they do research here in America that helps American health and enterprise. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=147.0s)]
*  I mean, everyone understands and knows this to some level. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=152.0s)]
*  Even MAGA people grasp the concept when the foreigner in question is, for instance, a certain South African migrant who, oh, how'd he get here? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=155.0s)]
*  Right, he made his way to study at the University of Pennsylvania before he started a bunch of companies becoming the world's richest man. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=161.0s)]
*  His immigration status during those early years, a little unclear, by the way. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=168.0s)]
*  Again, this is a very common story, and now the U.S. is basically trying to chase all these people out [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=172.0s)]
*  with these ludicrous mass visa cancellations, which appeared to start as a kind of ideological crusade [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=179.0s)]
*  against people that had wrong think on the issue of the war in Gaza. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=186.0s)]
*  But now they're just on this incomprehensibly capricious spree where they appear to be just getting anyone that's got any kind of infractions, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=190.0s)]
*  including people who had none that are maybe made up or an error. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=198.0s)]
*  Here's one example. In the case of Suguru Ande, he's a Japanese grad student in computer science at Brigham Young University. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=202.0s)]
*  He's married with five children, two of whom were born here in the U.S. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=208.0s)]
*  Ice told Ande his visa has been revoked because they found a criminal record for him, okay, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=212.0s)]
*  but he only has two speeding tickets on his record as well as a catch-and-release violation from a fishing trip in 2019, which was dismissed by a court. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=218.0s)]
*  Nevertheless, he and his family may be forced out of the country before the end of the month for two speeding tickets and a fishing violation, which was dismissed. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=228.0s)]
*  And of course, Trump persecution extends beyond college students, border officials in Houston detained and deported, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=239.0s)]
*  and Australian man who had more than a year left in his work visa. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=245.0s)]
*  He'd been trying to get back to the states after attending an overseas memorial for his sister. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=248.0s)]
*  He says U.S. officials called him an epithet and told him Trump is back in town. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=254.0s)]
*  We're doing things the way we always should have been doing them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=258.0s)]
*  Now, the effect of all this on people coming to this great country and on U.S. tourism is exactly what you'd expected to be. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=262.0s)]
*  See all those charts? See what direction they go? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=269.0s)]
*  It's from the Financial Times and it shows how travel from Europe to the U.S. has already cratered under Trump. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=272.0s)]
*  Foreign dollars that would have flown here not going here. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=278.0s)]
*  It's happening elsewhere, too. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=282.0s)]
*  New data this week shows that arrivals of non-citizens to the U.S. by plane dropped almost 10 percent in March from a year earlier. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=284.0s)]
*  And Canadian flight reservations to the U.S. are down 70 percent through September versus the same period last year, another study found. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=292.0s)]
*  That's Canada, which accounts for, get this, more than a quarter of tourism to the U.S. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=301.0s)]
*  In a new worst case estimate, Goldman Sachs says reduced travel and boycotts could cost the U.S. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=308.0s)]
*  almost 90 billion dollars in lost GDP this year alone. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=313.0s)]
*  Again, stress this enough. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=317.0s)]
*  That's money that flows from foreigners to Americans that Donald Trump, in his infinite wisdom, has decided to possibly choke off. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=319.0s)]
*  Trump can bray all he wants about sticking it to those no good foreigners. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=331.0s)]
*  But in the same way, it's actually Americans who are going to be the ones to pay the tariffs when it comes to his and Marco Rubio's war on tourism. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=335.0s)]
*  It's Americans that are going to pay the price. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=343.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chGRf5rijrw&t=365.0s)]
