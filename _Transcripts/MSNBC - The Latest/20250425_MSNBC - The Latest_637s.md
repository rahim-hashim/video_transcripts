# World leaders including Trump and Zelenskyy to attend Pope Francis’ funeral
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc)
*  With me here, Edward Penton, senior contributor for the National Catholic Register. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=0.0s)]
*  NBC's Molly Hunter is here at the Vatican for us. And Peter Baker, New York Times Chief White [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=4.64s)]
*  House correspondent and an MSNBC political analyst. So, Edward, I've been watching this [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=9.68s)]
*  parade of people day after day for the last three days, and now a very formal ritual, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=15.44s)]
*  the closing of the coffin. Tell us what's going to be going on behind closed doors. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=21.44s)]
*  This is not going to be televised inside the Basilica. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=26.64s)]
*  That's right. Yes, it's behind closed doors. It will be presided by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=29.76s)]
*  who's an American Cardinal. He's actually in charge of the Vatican during this [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=33.6s)]
*  vacancy. The Camerlengo. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=37.6s)]
*  The Camerlengo, exactly. And the ceremony is very old. It's very traditional. It's simpler than [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=38.72s)]
*  in the past because Pope Francis wanted a simpler ceremony. But at the same time, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=46.0s)]
*  it's the same. He's going to be covered with a silk white cloth, and then there's going to be [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=50.8s)]
*  coins placed in the coffin, one for each year of the pontificate. This is all going back a long [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=56.239999999999995s)]
*  time. And then there'll be the regito, a text that's going to be put in the coffin, a text about [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=60.64s)]
*  his pontificate. And then it'll be sealed and it'll be ready for the funeral tomorrow. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=66.16s)]
*  And that's what's happening inside, Molly. But outside, it was an extraordinary scene earlier [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=71.52s)]
*  today. I think at least for me, the largest crowds that I have seen. Talk about what we saw today. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=77.6s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, absolutely the largest crowds that we've seen all week, especially since Wednesday. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  And I think people, A, it's a national holiday here in Italy today, so a lot of people had off [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=91.44s)]
*  work and decided to come. And secondly, I think people had a couple of days to travel, maybe [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=95.2s)]
*  since the death was announced, since the Basilica opened on Wednesday to allow for public viewing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=99.6s)]
*  But I'm actually just turning around and looking. There's live cameras, Chris. I'm just looking at [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=104.88s)]
*  these huge screens. I'm down in St. Peter's Square. And it still shows a couple of people [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=109.44s)]
*  filing past. What the timeline that was meant to happen was at 5 p.m., actually. St. Peter's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=114.56s)]
*  Square was supposed to be cleared for security reasons. At 6 p.m., the last people were meant [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=119.28s)]
*  to enter that line. And at 7 p.m., the Basilica was going to be sealed shut. Now, Chris, we have [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=123.92s)]
*  a producer at the exit where people are coming out and at the entrance. And at the entrance, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=129.2s)]
*  our producer who's there says there are a lot of people who didn't make that cutoff, who didn't get [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=133.6s)]
*  to see to join that line and get to go into the Basilica and says it's quite a crowd of people, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=138.16s)]
*  including people who traveled from far away just for today, thinking that they would be able to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=143.04s)]
*  enter the line after 5 p.m. Thank you so much for that. Keep us posted, if you will. We won't learn [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=147.28s)]
*  until after tomorrow's funeral when the date will be of the conclave, which is the high drama of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=155.28s)]
*  these weeks. 135 eligible cardinals. We understand two of them are ill, could not travel. So there [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=162.64s)]
*  will be 133 interesting statistics. The average age now, just over 70, which is younger than in [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=169.2s)]
*  2005 and in 2015. We know this is going to be geographically the most diverse group we've ever [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=175.92s)]
*  seen before. A lot of those folks appointed by Pope Francis. How will those statistics, geography, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=181.76s)]
*  age play into all of this, you think? Well, it's going to be interesting. It certainly makes it more [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=189.12s)]
*  interesting because I think it'll be perhaps more attractive than normal. It may go on a few more [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  days than people are expecting. And it also makes the likelihood of whoever might become [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=198.24s)]
*  Pope more unpredictable. So it makes it for a much more interesting conclave. We've talked a lot over [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=204.8s)]
*  the last couple of days about how this is an opportunity for cardinals to speak to each other [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=210.4s)]
*  informally as well as more formally in meetings that they have. But I wonder, given that so many [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=215.12s)]
*  people, because of their far-flung nature, may not know each other as well or know each other really [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  over the computer or over social media, if they might hold the conclave a few days later, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=227.12s)]
*  they have some wiggle room on that. Yes, they may extend it, the beginning of it, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=233.04s)]
*  to being slightly later. Some say it's going to be going on Monday, May the 5th, but it probably, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  it may start a bit later than that. But the point you make about them not knowing each other is a [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  very important one because they come from such a diverse background that this is the first time, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=247.12s)]
*  and there's so many of them, that it'll be very difficult for them to know who they're voting for, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=252.08s)]
*  which is why I, together with a team of researchers, created this website called [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=256.72s)]
*  the CollegeOfCardinalsReport.com, which you can go and see and you can get all the profiles of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=261.20000000000005s)]
*  all the cardinals, including 40 in-depth profiles. And that's really a service, meant as a service [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  for the cardinals so that they know who they're voting for and can make an informed choice. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=270.88000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, there are going to be a lot of conversations going on. Peter, let me go back for a minute [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=274.88000000000005s)]
*  to President Trump. Again, he left this morning, he stopped for the cameras. I want to play a little [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=279.04s)]
*  bit more of what he had to say. We're leading and going to Rome, where we'll be attending the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=283.12s)]
*  funeral of Pope Francis. It's going to be very interesting. We're going to meet with a lot of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=291.12s)]
*  the foreign leaders they want to meet. Trade deals are going very well. I think Russia [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=294.8s)]
*  and Ukraine, I think they're coming along, we hope. Very fragile. And Iran, I think, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=301.92s)]
*  is going very well. We'll see what happens. We're working on plenty of things. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=307.44s)]
*  In fact, there is news that some of world leaders who will be attending, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=310.72s)]
*  Ukrainian President Zelensky, the head of the EU Commission, among them, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=316.8s)]
*  we've heard that they want to get a meeting with President Trump as long as they're here. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  What do you say to those who might argue, this is the Pope's funeral? Why can't we keep politics [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=326.88000000000005s)]
*  out of it? Well, look, I mean, the truth is, it is, of course, a solemn moment and they will [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=332.48s)]
*  respect that, I think. But if they're in the same city at the same time when all these things are [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=338.88s)]
*  happening, meetings on the sidelines are not surprising, honestly. That's happened before. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=343.44s)]
*  And I think the Pope would want meetings if they were to lead to peace, right? I think that's [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=349.28s)]
*  something he considered to be important. Whether this will actually lead to that is hard to know. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=353.92s)]
*  Reason why so many world leaders want to get in the room with Trump is because they recognize [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=358.96s)]
*  that he is the one person who really matters in his administration. You can make deals [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=363.12s)]
*  with lower-level officials, you can make deals with secretaries of state or [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=367.36s)]
*  with special envoys. But unless Trump has signed off on it, unless it matches whatever he thinks [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=370.8s)]
*  he wants, you can't assume it's going to go forward. And right now, these talks, particularly [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=375.44s)]
*  on Ukraine, are at a very delicate moment. The Russians are still showing their aggressive side [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  by firing missiles at Kiev, and Zelensky is being pressured to give up territory that he's not [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=385.2s)]
*  willing to concede. It's a very, very delicate moment, and Trump himself may get involved. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  This is a global event, and one of the things that seems to have popped is pictures of a mural by a [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=398.32s)]
*  street artist showing the Pope looking at a guest list for his funeral. And it includes President [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=404.0s)]
*  Trump and the president of Argentina with the caption, but who invited them? I do think it [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  speaks to one of the more fascinating aspects of Donald Trump's space. So many Christians and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  Catholics embracing President Trump, and frankly others like him and the Pope at the same time. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=422.24s)]
*  Having covered the president and his supporters from the very beginning, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=430.64s)]
*  how do you address that? How do you speak to that? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, look, President Trump did win a majority of the Catholic vote in last November's election [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=439.44s)]
*  over Kamala Harris. He split it in 2020 with Joe Biden, who of course is the second Catholic [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=443.92s)]
*  president. A lot of Catholics do support President Trump, even as they might, of course, revere the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=449.28s)]
*  Pope. This Pope was a very controversial Pope on the American right. The American right saw him [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  as being too liberal. I've heard conservative Catholics in the United States refer to him as [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=460.8s)]
*  Obama's Pope, somebody they saw as too far to the left on issues of climate change, for instance, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=465.44s)]
*  and respect for people who are LGBTQ and so forth. But look, this has always been a dichotomy [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  between politics and religion. The Catholic Church can be both against abortion and against [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=483.52s)]
*  the death penalty. In America, those are split between the political right and the political [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=490.96s)]
*  left. It's not as clear cut as our politics might be. And so I think you have a lot of Catholics who [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=495.44s)]
*  can basically see these things as something they can reconcile, support for a political leader at [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=502.88s)]
*  the same time they revere the head of their church. Yeah, and let's not kid ourselves. This Pope never [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=508.8s)]
*  shied away from hot-button political issues. But let me bring it back to what we're seeing happening [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=515.2s)]
*  now, because something that happens after the funeral tomorrow hasn't been seen in more than [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=519.52s)]
*  100 years. That is, a Pope is going to be buried not in the Basilica beneath the Basilica behind [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  me, but he's going to be buried after, I guess, a kind of a procession to St. Mary Major. You [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=530.24s)]
*  tweeted these pictures. It's been a little bit secretive about exactly where he's going to be. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=537.28s)]
*  You see the wood around where they're working. Why there? And what do we imagine is going on [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  behind that wooden barrier? Right. Well, he chose St. Mary Major because he had a great devotion [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=548.32s)]
*  to the Blessed Virgin Mary. And he used to go before he'd go abroad, he'd always go to the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  St. Mary Major Basilica to pray to her. And then at the end of the visit, he'd go and pray to her [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=559.52s)]
*  again at the Basilica. So it was always very close to his heart. And I think he just really wants to [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=564.72s)]
*  to be close to Our Lady. I think that's what he feels. And the tomb itself, again, it's very [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  in keeping with Pope Francis, and that it's very simple. It's very, it's just basic. We've seen [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=576.88s)]
*  pictures of how it's going to look. And it's just his name with a simple white marble slab. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's how he wanted it. And it's very, it epitomizes his pontificate in many ways. And also [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=588.0s)]
*  the other interesting thing about his, when he arrives at St. Mary Major, there's going to be a [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=593.28s)]
*  sort of official farewell from the poorest of the poor. And he was very, one of the great strengths [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=598.9599999999999s)]
*  about Francis. He was a controversial Pope indeed, but one of the great strengths of his was his [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=605.04s)]
*  outreach to those who are the poorest of the poor, the most vulnerable. And so it'll be a very strong [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=610.72s)]
*  witness to that. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qbSESAjoNc&t=615.68s)]
