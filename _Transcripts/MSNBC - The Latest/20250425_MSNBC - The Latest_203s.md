# FBI arrests Wisconsin judge for allegedly interfering in immigration operation
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto)
*  at a judge in Wisconsin was arrested this morning at the very courthouse where she works. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us now is NBC's Tom Wunter back with us as Temidalia Oganga Williams. So Tom, what exactly [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=6.08s)]
*  happened here? Right, so the details are still coming in but the reporting comes from our colleague [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=11.76s)]
*  Mike Kosner at our Washington DC bureau. He's reporting that Judge Hannah Duggan, who she's a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=15.68s)]
*  Milwaukee County Circuit judge, was arrested this morning quote for allegedly assisting an undocumented [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=20.88s)]
*  immigrant in avoiding arrest after he appeared in her courtroom last week. Apparently, and by the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=26.4s)]
*  way we found out about all of this because the FBI director Cash Patel issued a tweet that has since [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=32.16s)]
*  been deleted, we're not sure why it was deleted, announcing this arrest and announcing these [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=38.64s)]
*  charges and he said quote, we believe Judge Duggan intentionally misdirected federal agents away [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=43.04s)]
*  from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse Eduardo Flores Ruiz allowing the subject, an [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  illegal alien, his words, to evade arrest end quote. So we're still trying to get some of the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=54.08s)]
*  details as to what this individual was specifically brought into court for, what charges they were [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=58.72s)]
*  specifically facing, and some of the details of this arrest I checked just as you were talking [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=64.24s)]
*  to our colleague Chris Jansing there in Rome, the docket in Wisconsin, the federal charging documents [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  have not yet been unsealed in this particular case. That's not particularly unusual when an arrest [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=76.64s)]
*  happens and sometimes it takes a while for that paperwork and remember there's a time difference [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=82.8s)]
*  as well to appear on the record. So again, still trying to get some details but again the arrest [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  was apparently made at 9 30 Eastern time this morning. This follows by the way Jose some similar [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=92.56s)]
*  types of incidents throughout the country where judges have been involved in some of these ICE [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=100.08s)]
*  cases just yesterday. The Suffolk County district attorney in Boston, a democratically elected [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=104.96s)]
*  district attorney, issued a report actually chastising the judge that was involved in an [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=111.28s)]
*  immigration case there saying the judge acted improperly after the judge accused ICE and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=117.12s)]
*  prosecutors there of basically colluding together to get somebody who was about to face trial. A [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=122.08s)]
*  jury had just been impaneled to be removed by ICE. The district attorney's office did an investigation [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=127.6s)]
*  into that and actually rebuked what the judge said. So there's definitely some pushback in law [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=133.12s)]
*  enforcement circles and one of the things that the Suffolk County district attorney pointed to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=137.28s)]
*  there which may or may not be relevant in the Milwaukee case in this judge that was just arrested [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=141.2s)]
*  and the judge that we've been speaking about is this idea of the supremacy cause. Basically ICE [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  has the authority because they're a federal agency to conduct these arrests whether or not it's in a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=150.88s)]
*  local courtroom or not and there have been different steps and different things have been [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=157.28s)]
*  done over the years with respect to some of these arrests and there's been a number of cases that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=161.04s)]
*  have gone through this even all prior to this current Trump administration. So it's definitely [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  an issue that I think everybody thought would reach a particular point. It appears that it has [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=170.56s)]
*  this morning in the case of this Milwaukee judge. We'll just have to see what charges are ultimately [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=175.6s)]
*  brought once that docket becomes unsealed. Jose. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=180.48s)]
*  you [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nsDdhHGto&t=200.56s)]
