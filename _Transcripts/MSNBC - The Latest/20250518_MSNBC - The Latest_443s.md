# ‘I’m absolutely furious’: Fmr. South Africa ambassador slams Trump’s White refugee double standard
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0)
*  As President Trump's cruel deportation campaign aimed at removing millions of immigrants from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=0.0s)]
*  the United States wages on, the president is making an exception for one group, white [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=6.18s)]
*  South Africans. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=11.3s)]
*  Unlike the Trump administration's treatment of other immigrants, especially those from [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=13.22s)]
*  Latin America and our Afghan allies that he's kicking out of sometime soon, the president [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=17.86s)]
*  gave a warm welcome to dozens of white South Africans this week. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  He's also expediting refugee statuses for the group, which he says includes victims [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=29.54s)]
*  of racial discrimination. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  The move comes after his decision to freeze refugee admissions from other nations and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=36.14s)]
*  cut off resettlement funding. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=40.68s)]
*  So we have back with us former United States ambassador to South Africa, Patrick Gaspar, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=42.5s)]
*  is back with us to discuss. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=47.379999999999995s)]
*  It's a bit mind boggling how Donald Trump of all the nations in the globe, all of the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=50.22s)]
*  conflict, the famine. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=56.26s)]
*  You know, we have Afghanistan where allies who worked for us, we aren't letting into [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=59.379999999999995s)]
*  the country and they've been cleared and vetted. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=64.02s)]
*  Yet South Africa, you were former ambassador there. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=66.86s)]
*  Can you talk about what he is describing as persecution? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=71.84s)]
*  I will. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  You know, I'll say a couple of things first. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=77.53999999999999s)]
*  You know, when, when I come on shows like this, I'm, I'm trained to kind of retain my [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=78.53999999999999s)]
*  anger. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=82.46s)]
*  It's hard to do that on this, on this issue. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=83.56s)]
*  I'm absolutely furious. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=86.3s)]
*  There are a number of things that are going on here. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=87.3s)]
*  One, Trump is playing to a domestic US fringe political audience, which I'll talk about [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=89.94s)]
*  in a second. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=96.58s)]
*  There's a geopolitical impact because there's an attempt to punish South Africa for the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=97.58s)]
*  posture that is taken internationally on the war in Gaza and its claims against Israel. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=101.62s)]
*  And Trump is very clear about the need to punish South Africa in that regard. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=109.7s)]
*  But there's a third thing that's happening. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=113.92s)]
*  Donald Trump is the master of distraction. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=115.42s)]
*  And he knows that while we're having this conversation, we're not talking about the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=117.54s)]
*  prices that are going up for average Americans in Walmart. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=120.34s)]
*  He loves that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=123.06s)]
*  So on South Africa, there's a bill that was passed by the parliament in South Africa in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=124.1s)]
*  order to right historic wrongs in the country in 1913. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=130.5s)]
*  And then again, in 1950, a set of laws were passed that restricted the ability of blacks [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=134.74s)]
*  in South Africa to own land. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=139.78s)]
*  They made sure that whites that were then less than 10% of the population, now less [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=141.66s)]
*  than 8% of the population, controlled 93% of the land in South Africa in 1913, about [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=146.57999999999998s)]
*  75% of it from the 1950s onwards. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=153.42s)]
*  And right now, today, even though white South Africans comprise, again, less than 8% of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=156.66s)]
*  the population, they control more than 65% of the private land that exists in the country. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=161.34s)]
*  So a law was passed to try to make some determinations about how to better allocate resources in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=168.1s)]
*  the country. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  But it's very similar to laws that were passed in this country. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  Like under the Fifth Amendment here, we have the right of eminent domain that the nation [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=179.38s)]
*  can impose in times of national security. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=185.78s)]
*  It's the same sort of law in South Africa. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=188.54s)]
*  But there is no way that land is being seized from white South Africans without compensation, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=190.5s)]
*  without due price. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=195.14s)]
*  It's just not happening. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=196.14s)]
*  It's a fiction from Donald Trump, from Elon Musk, and so many of their friends in the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=197.17999999999998s)]
*  fringe right like Tucker Carlson. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=201.54s)]
*  So now you have a president who is overturning the long-term asylum procedures that we have [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=204.01999999999998s)]
*  here in the U.S. for people who are fleeing violence, real political violence, from countries [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=210.61999999999998s)]
*  like Afghanistan. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=215.94s)]
*  But he's throwing it open to a group of people who are political pawns right now, Afrikaners [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=217.45999999999998s)]
*  from South Africa who may or may not feel physically threatened in some way. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=222.98s)]
*  But if you follow the data in South Africa, whites comprise 2% of victims of murder and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=227.34s)]
*  violent crime in the country. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=234.66s)]
*  And the crime that he's describing on these farms. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=235.66s)]
*  2% of the crime in the country targets these white farmers. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=237.38s)]
*  It is an obscene thing to say. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=244.54s)]
*  Ambassador, I want to pick up on something you said in response to Elise, that the three [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=246.82s)]
*  things that are happening here, you said one of them is that the president is playing [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=252.34s)]
*  to a domestic U.S. audience. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=257.18s)]
*  I want to read something from Callie Holloway that she wrote in The Nation on Friday, the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=259.66s)]
*  real reason those white South Africans are here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=265.9s)]
*  I'm going to quote her. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=268.7s)]
*  To be clear, white South Africans, and this really cannot be reiterated enough, are not [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=269.94s)]
*  being persecuted. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=274.98s)]
*  The red carpet is being rolled out for them slowly and deliberately, I might add. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=276.54s)]
*  As a political signal, consider it a statement of allegiance to whiteness, a full-throated [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=281.8s)]
*  declaration of where and with whom this administration's priorities lie. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=287.12s)]
*  If you are of a certain age, you remember the anti-apartheid demonstrations that were [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=293.26s)]
*  happening all over the country, and particularly on college campuses, and to see here we are [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=298.3s)]
*  you know, several decades hence that Afrikaners are being given refugee status and coming [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=303.64s)]
*  to bring, being brought here to the United States, we knew exactly the signal that President [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=310.56s)]
*  Trump was sending when he did that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=316.74s)]
*  Absolutely, Jonathan. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=318.91999999999996s)]
*  You and I are old enough to have participated in those demonstrations, right? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  So the first time I ever went to South Africa was 1991, and I got to observe Nelson Mandela's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=324.44s)]
*  vision for a rainbow nation. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=332.06s)]
*  I lived three and a half years in South Africa as ambassador, and I've seen white and black [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=333.94s)]
*  South Africans and colored South Africans working every single day towards the affirmation [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=338.02s)]
*  of that vision. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  I talk to my white South African friends all the time, and they think it's bizarre that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  this is occurring now. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=348.5s)]
*  They can't recognize their country that's being described by Donald Trump. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=350.38s)]
*  I will say that white supremacy has never lived in isolation. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=353.29999999999995s)]
*  It has always and ever thus will be a global phenomena. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=357.68s)]
*  There is a conversation that's taking place from the United States to South Africa to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=361.54s)]
*  Australia, to in Europe with fringe neo-Nazi adjacent groups like Afroforum that are promoting [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=366.66s)]
*  this notion of a white genocide. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=374.62s)]
*  It is really instructive to see the president of the United States, who is denying the plight, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=376.9s)]
*  the struggle of Palestinians in this moment who are under siege. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=383.78s)]
*  It's interesting to hear him use the word genocide when he's talking about a people [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=387.58000000000004s)]
*  who represent 7 percent of the population, have like 70 percent of the land, have 65 [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=391.62s)]
*  percent of the senior management jobs in South Africa, and whose unemployment ratio is like [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=397.1s)]
*  one-twentieth of the unemployment ratio of blacks in South Africa. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=403.98s)]
*  This is deliberate. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=408.5s)]
*  It is signaling to his fringe MAGA cohort here in the U.S. and sending a wide signal [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=409.66s)]
*  to those who are neo-Nazi adjacent in other parts of the world. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7t7ifgyuu0&t=418.7s)]
