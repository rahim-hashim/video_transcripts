# Why Trump agenda bill means you’ll be paying more for health care
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA)
*  Joining me now is our friend of Massachusetts Congressman Jake Ockenclus. Congressman, welcome [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=0.0s)]
*  and thanks for joining us on a holiday weekend particularly. You joined every other House [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=4.32s)]
*  Democrat voting no on President Trump's spending bill. The Congressional Budget Office estimates [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  it's $4 trillion in tax cuts lead to the top 10% of earners getting an income boost of about 4% [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=14.48s)]
*  in 2027. The huge cuts to Medicaid and social safety net programs will cause the bottom 10% [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=21.84s)]
*  of household incomes to fall about 2%. If this passes, how will it impact your constituents and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=28.08s)]
*  what do you say to Republicans who claim this bill is all about fiscal responsibility? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=35.28s)]
*  Alex, thanks for having me on. My head's spinning because I think I agree with Rand Paul actually. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=42.4s)]
*  Doesn't happen very often, but Rand Paul calls him as he sees him on the budget and he is 100% [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=50.08s)]
*  right. This is one of the most fiscally irresponsible bills ever passed, adding trillions [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=55.36s)]
*  to the national debt. And for what? To give tax cuts to people who don't need tax cuts. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=60.96s)]
*  Madeleine Dean put it really well about the effects on people who will lose health care access through [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=66.24s)]
*  Medicaid and will lose access to food security through SNAP. I want to add one other element to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=70.8s)]
*  this bill though and that is even if you get health care through your employer, you're still [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=76.0s)]
*  going to suffer from this legislation because you're going to pay a lot more. What's going to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=84.0s)]
*  happen is all those people who got kicked off of Medicaid, they still get sick, right? And instead [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  of going to a community health center, now they go to an emergency room where it costs about 10 times [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=93.68s)]
*  more. The care is less comprehensive. Hospitals have to subsidize that uncompensated care by [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=98.08s)]
*  charging more to the commercial health insurance corporations who then pass on those higher premiums [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=103.84s)]
*  to employers. That is a well understood health care phenomenon and what it's going to mean is [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=108.56s)]
*  that the middle class already being squeezed by child care, already being squeezed by health care, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=113.36s)]
*  already being squeezed by housing, is now going to pay even more. Yeah, go figure that. So a federal [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=118.0s)]
*  judge Friday temporarily blocked the administration from cutting off Harvard's enrollment of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=125.04s)]
*  international students after accusing the university of creating an unsafe campus environment for Jewish [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=129.28s)]
*  students. You are a Harvard alum and you have been critical of your alma mater, but you told [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=134.88s)]
*  Politico the administration quote is acting just like the most unhinged of the anti-Israel campus [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  protesters last year, performative, irrational, and cruel. So expand on that in terms of what you mean [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=145.6s)]
*  and is the Trump administration making some kind of a political power play over Harvard or is it [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=152.8s)]
*  something else? It's extortion. It's not about politics. It's not about policy. It's certainly [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=157.12s)]
*  not about the Jewish community. It's about culture. One of the core motivators of the Trump [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=164.56s)]
*  administration is the contention that the commanding heights of Western civilization from NATO to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=172.0s)]
*  national public radio to the NIH to universities, they've been taken over by the left and so what [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=177.52s)]
*  this administration is doing is waging guerrilla war against the left and Harvard of course is a [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=183.28s)]
*  symbolically critical fight and Jewish students and now students from every foreign country, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=188.56s)]
*  Nigeria, China, Europe are being caught in the middle of this enterprise. There is a right way [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=196.08s)]
*  to address anti-Semitism on campus. I've been working in both a bipartisan and through non-profit [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=201.84s)]
*  lanes to do that. What Trump is doing is not the right way. Like everything else that he does, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=207.12s)]
*  it's selfish and illegal. Which brings me to Trump having spent Thursday night at his Virginia golf [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=211.84s)]
*  club hosting the top 220 holders of the Trump crypto coin. A attendee spent an average of 1.8 [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=218.16s)]
*  million dollars on those coins and the White House said the president held the event in his personal [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=224.56s)]
*  time but the dinner website reads quote here firsthand President Trump talk about the future [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=229.6s)]
*  of crypto and then you had that lectern which obviously carried the presidential seal. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=236.24s)]
*  What do you make of Trump selling access and profiting off the presidency and does the president [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=241.2s)]
*  of the United States ever enjoy personal time like this without associating the president [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=245.6s)]
*  with being the president? I mean it's like King Charles. Is he ever not the King of England in [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=252.48s)]
*  any public forum? I don't think these crypto investors are trying to have dinner with the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=257.44s)]
*  president because of his charming and charismatic personality. They're trying to have dinner with [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=264.48s)]
*  the president because he is the president of the United States and he is monetizing access to the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=267.6s)]
*  levers of power in the U.S. government and they want to buy that power. This is exactly the concerns [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=273.12s)]
*  that Senator Warren and I had in January when two days after he issued his meme coin we launched [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=278.56s)]
*  a series of letters to the SEC and to the Treasury Department asking what exactly they were going to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  do to prevent violations of the emoluments clause under the constitution and right now what we are [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=290.8s)]
*  seeing is foreigners including people with strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party are buying the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=296.08s)]
*  United States presidency and that's just the people we know about Alex. There are investors in [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=302.64s)]
*  his cryptocurrency who didn't show up to that dinner and who are they involved with? The Iranian [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=307.28s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Politburo, the Kremlin, the Venezuelans and you know they're [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=312.32s)]
*  going to call those chits in at a time and place of their choosing. Trump returned to his trade war [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=318.56s)]
*  Friday threatening a 50% tax on all European Union imports, a 25% tariff on Apple iPhones if they [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=324.32s)]
*  aren't made in America. Stocks dropped and worries about the global economy rose. Trump's tariffs [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=330.72s)]
*  haven't produced the trade deals that he wants or the return of domestic manufacturing that he's [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=337.12s)]
*  promised voters. Are things not going well for him despite his claims? The same night where [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  tens of millions of Americans were watching their 401ks dip because of more chaos and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=348.16s)]
*  incompetence from his administration, Donald Trump was having dinner with 200 investors in his own [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=352.88000000000005s)]
*  personal net worth and it really underscores where his focus is at. His focus is not on your [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=358.64s)]
*  retirement security, his focus is on his retirement security and that type of self-dealing [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=363.2s)]
*  explains just the incompetency of these tariff proposals, right? There is a world in which we do [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  want to implement a tariff on China because we're not having free trade with free people right now, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=377.52s)]
*  they're cheating on the terms of trade but you do that through Congress, you do that with allies [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=382.32s)]
*  and you do that in concert with an industrial policy that has a point of view and a plan about [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=386.24s)]
*  how we're going to re-industrialize parts of our geography here in the United States. What he's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=390.56s)]
*  doing is tariff by tweet and it's making everybody poorer. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=396.56s)]
*  you [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAsGESuz3WA&t=416.24s)]
