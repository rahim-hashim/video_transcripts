# ‘Make. Life. Better.’: DNC Vice Chair lays out what Democratic priorities should be going forward
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU)
*  New calls today for Democratic Party reforms ahead of next year's midterms. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=0.0s)]
*  And they come as new revelations about the capability of President Biden are drawing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=5.92s)]
*  concerns from Democrats, some offering their opinions on how to move forward this morning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=9.86s)]
*  We played too much deference to party leaders, to the old guard, to the advisers. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=17.86s)]
*  We needed to be more independent and push back. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=23.6s)]
*  Before we get out here and start trying to tell people why they should like us, we need [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=26.06s)]
*  to look in the mirror, reorganize ourselves, get bad people and bad ideas out of the way, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=30.299999999999997s)]
*  and then we'll be able to come forward in the midterm. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=35.82s)]
*  And with me here in the studio, Pennsylvania State Representative and DNC Vice Chair, Malcolm [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=38.62s)]
*  Kenyatta. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  Malcolm, welcome. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  Let me pick up on that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  What was just said there? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=47.06s)]
*  We need to get bad people and bad ideas out of there, and then we'll be able to come forward [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=48.4s)]
*  in the midterms. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=53.54s)]
*  Give me your reaction. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=54.54s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=56.019999999999996s)]
*  You know, I'll leave other people to comment on what they're saying, but let me tell you [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  what I think. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=59.94s)]
*  The Democratic Party, our mission, and then ultimately our message can be summed up for [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=61.26s)]
*  me in three words. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=66.1s)]
*  Make life better. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=67.58s)]
*  How do we make life better for the seniors who are right now watching in horror that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=69.42s)]
*  Republicans want to cut Social Security, calling it a Ponzi scheme? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=74.3s)]
*  How do we make life better for the mom who's being squeezed and can't spend the time with [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=77.18s)]
*  she's working an extra shift. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=82.78s)]
*  And certainly, how do we do that for workers and working people who want to join a union? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  I think we do it by passing the PRO Act, giving people a raise by raising the minimum [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=89.06s)]
*  wage. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=92.42s)]
*  The list goes on and on. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=93.42s)]
*  And so we have to keep the main thing the main thing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=94.54s)]
*  And the main thing is Donald Trump has spent over a hundred days making life worse and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=96.78s)]
*  miserable for the American people, for the benefit of himself and his donors, while life [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=101.3s)]
*  does not get better for working families. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=105.82s)]
*  So is our constituents telling you specifics? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=107.26s)]
*  Look, this has got to change. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=109.5s)]
*  And if so, how does that align or not align with traditional democratic values? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=111.78s)]
*  A part of the problem we face right now is that there's so much noise and we're having [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  this inner party debate that you are well aware of. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=122.94s)]
*  And I don't want to add to that noise, but I do want to cut through that noise. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=127.78s)]
*  Right now, I've been having a conversation with my fellow vice chair about some of the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=133.06s)]
*  machinations and debates that are that are happening. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=137.26s)]
*  And I think it's important, though, that people understand this timeline right here. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=140.46s)]
*  So on February the 28th, someone challenged the election of my vice chair and David because [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  of procedural grounds. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=149.66s)]
*  On March the 25th, Chairman Martin laid out a bold agenda to reform the party, including [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=151.18s)]
*  neutrality. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=156.74s)]
*  And it wasn't until April 16th that David made clear he was not going to abide by that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=157.74s)]
*  neutrality plan. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=162.14s)]
*  I think leading into this election, it should be clear to voters. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=163.14s)]
*  And it's important that voters know party leaders are not going to pick our nominees [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=166.26s)]
*  for president or for state representative that they are going to pick. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=170.73999999999998s)]
*  And then we as party leaders are going to respect their support. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=174.54s)]
*  Yeah, I would have that conversation even further if David, who are here with you, I'd [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=176.54s)]
*  like to have him be able to respond to things. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=180.1s)]
*  But there are a number of Democrats who are either hinting that themselves. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=181.94s)]
*  Look, we might run. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  Others may be calling on us to run. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=189.06s)]
*  Give me a sense of who you think is prioritizing not only Democratic Party values that can [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=191.02s)]
*  reach the majority of Democrats, but stand up to President Trump at the same time. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=197.18s)]
*  Are those things mutually exclusive? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=203.06s)]
*  I think it goes back to those three words. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=205.74s)]
*  You make life better. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=207.58s)]
*  If you're talking about how we make life better for folks, then you have to have a conversation [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  at the same time that we can't fund tax breaks for billionaires and then cut the social safety [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=213.34s)]
*  net for the American worker. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=219.02s)]
*  That puts you in a position where you're doing both. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=221.74s)]
*  If you want to talk about making life better for people, as I believe the Democratic Party [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=223.9s)]
*  must, then that means you have to stand up to Donald Trump trying to disappear people, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=227.3s)]
*  ignore court orders, because it puts the rule of law in real chaos. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=231.66s)]
*  And so we have to do both. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=236.78s)]
*  And I know that what we're going to do is try to tamp down the noise, try to keep the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=238.66s)]
*  main thing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=243.14s)]
*  The main thing is the Super Bowl winning coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, Nick Sirianni [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=244.14s)]
*  And the main thing is we need to make life better for working people. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=247.58s)]
*  Donald Trump is only trying to make life better for him and his family. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=250.38s)]
*  Let me look quickly, though, at the Democratic favorability numbers. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=252.78s)]
*  It's kind of tough lately. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=256.62s)]
*  Let me go through them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=257.82s)]
*  They're generally underwater strategists, though, like James Carville. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=258.7s)]
*  Pretty bullish thing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=262.94s)]
*  Not only do we have a shot at winning in 2026 in the midterms, but he thinks we're winning [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=264.22s)]
*  now. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=269.5s)]
*  Smaller necessarily, but you know, state legislature and races like that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=269.98s)]
*  But do you agree with him? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=274.78000000000003s)]
*  This is what I think. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=277.42s)]
*  I think at the end of the day, there are a lot of people like me who want to reform this [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=279.02s)]
*  party. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=283.18s)]
*  It was a part of the reason I ran. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=283.58s)]
*  I didn't run because I thought everything was going great. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  But there are too many people who think that coming and sitting with you, Alex, and other [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=287.1s)]
*  people and saying the Democratic Party sucks, that that's actually reforming the party. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=290.38s)]
*  That doesn't reform the party. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=293.9s)]
*  We have to do the hard work of making sure that when voters pick our nominees, not party [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=295.42s)]
*  bosses, that we have everything in place for them to beat Republicans in the fall. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=300.14s)]
*  That's why right now at the Democratic Party, we're investing over a million dollars a [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=305.02s)]
*  month into our state parties, the largest investment in history. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=309.5s)]
*  It's why we're hiring the top talent and not just talent out of the political world, but [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=313.02s)]
*  top incredible talent who can help power our response to Donald Trump's lies. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=317.9s)]
*  And it's why we're building out the technological infrastructure. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=322.46s)]
*  And I get a lot of these things for the average person is boring. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=325.09999999999997s)]
*  What they see is the results of the work that we're doing behind the scenes. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=328.29999999999995s)]
*  I want to make sure that we are focused on that and we're lifting up voices that want to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=332.3s)]
*  prioritize the three word mission of this party. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=337.42s)]
*  Make life better. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=341.58s)]
*  I gotcha. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=343.18s)]
*  Okay. Thank you for communicating that to us. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=344.06s)]
*  And I love your enthusiasm. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=346.14s)]
*  Clearly, A for effort working on this. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=347.74s)]
*  Malcolm Kenyatta, thank you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1RArvi0OU&t=349.34000000000003s)]
