# Plane debacle: Ari Melber on Qatar blatantly playing Donald Trump
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0)
*  While President Trump is facing a scandal that's overwhelming this first foreign trip [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=0.0s)]
*  of his term, total condemnation for the bid to get a $400 million jet from Qatar. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=4.24s)]
*  Conservatives rebuking it as a blatant grift. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=12.48s)]
*  Elected Republicans opposing this and really trying to duck what they see as obvious political [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=14.68s)]
*  blowback for something they want no part of. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=18.48s)]
*  Democrats blasting it, of course. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  And then many ethics and nonpartisan experts agreeing this is actually, numerically, the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=24.34s)]
*  worst attempted corruption in the history of the White House. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=29.2s)]
*  Those are just some of the headlines battering Trump during the trip as he lands today in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=33.28s)]
*  the country offering this controversial and possibly illegal gift, Qatar. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=38.92s)]
*  And in one side, the entire plan might already be on the rocks. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=44.92s)]
*  Neither side publicly addressed this Trump controversy over the plane as he de-boarded [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=48.0s)]
*  a different plane. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=53.32s)]
*  Now for many Western democracies, Qatar is seen as a pretty extreme and challenging [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=54.8s)]
*  dictatorship to deal with. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=58.96s)]
*  It runs as an autocratic monarchy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=61.24s)]
*  They have crackdowns on human rights, limits on free speech, and of course the press over [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=63.7s)]
*  there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=68.08s)]
*  They fund Al Jazeera, and many U.S. experts view that as partly a tool of foreign influence [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=69.08s)]
*  sometimes cutting against U.S. interests. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=74.66s)]
*  They also work with the U.S. military, so it's a relationship that's complicated, nuanced [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=78.32s)]
*  to be sure, but it complicates American interests because this is a regime that does Iran diplomacy, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=82.74s)]
*  that hosts a Taliban office in Doha. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=89.3s)]
*  And this is not news to Donald Trump, by the way. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=92.82s)]
*  Back around the first term, he was blasting this same Qatar regime as what he called a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=95.72s)]
*  super terror funder. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=100.5s)]
*  Qatar clearly wants to play ball. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=102.61999999999999s)]
*  Qatar would rather pay money, which it gathers from its resources and people in a system [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=104.82s)]
*  where they have no accountability. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=110.02s)]
*  They're a monarchy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  They'd rather take that money to buy influence than change any of the policies that the U.S. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=113.34s)]
*  has a problem with. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=118.34s)]
*  Indeed, Qatar has been trying to transform its reputation, the Times reports, by spending [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=119.34s)]
*  millions on lobbyists in Washington, including Pam Bondi, now Trump's attorney general. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=123.94s)]
*  Now, Trump's visit, the Times notes, is a part of this wider success for a very pricey [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=129.98s)]
*  influence strategy for a relatively controversial autocratic monarchy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=137.94s)]
*  And their strategy appears to be working. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=143.33999999999997s)]
*  You have this regime trying to buy their way to some sort of better reputation or treatment [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=145.82s)]
*  by the United States. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=150.33999999999997s)]
*  That's the problem underlying the whole jet gift. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=152.98s)]
*  And it's also why, separate from the ethics, we're not getting an offer of a jet for our [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=155.28s)]
*  politicians from Canada. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=161.01999999999998s)]
*  Qatar has more cleanup to do. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=164.14s)]
*  And so even apart from the obvious ethics, which should have made this whole thing dead [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=166.14s)]
*  on arrival or not cleared for takeoff, if you prefer, even beyond that, Qatar has faced [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=170.42s)]
*  skepticism from American leaders for its actions on moral grounds and on the normal foreign [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=175.82s)]
*  policy grounds that they're adverse to U.S. interests. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  And so here, instead of facing the normal pressure of possibly changing those policies [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=184.2s)]
*  or just paying the consequences, the evidence and the influence campaign suggests what [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=188.14s)]
*  everyone's concerned about, that Qatar is trying to corrupt the United States process [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=194.82s)]
*  from inside, using or abusing money and influence to buy a closer relationship than the facts [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=199.18s)]
*  would otherwise warrant. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  Now this is according to multiple administrations and experts that have previously determined [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=206.7s)]
*  that Qatar, at a minimum, should be kept at arm's length, that you don't just embrace [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=211.22s)]
*  a monarchy like this or you can dial back to the Trump quote I played you or his own [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=215.45999999999998s)]
*  focus on the terror funding. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=221.22s)]
*  That was back before all the Qatar money offers were coming in. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=224.1s)]
*  The facts and the offer from Qatar suggests that this is not about what's best for America. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=229.9s)]
*  It's about a foreign effort to make Qatar great. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=236.92s)]
*  To take a turn on the Reagan phrase that Trump rebooted, of course, for his campaigns. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=241.9s)]
*  And this isn't a new or creative type of corruption to try to make Qatar great. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=246.88s)]
*  It's actually one of the oldest things in the book. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=254.68s)]
*  The founders of this country knew that there was always going to be a risk for the United [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=257.96s)]
*  States as a democracy with rotating leaders who don't just hold on to money like a monarchy, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=261.82s)]
*  that they might someday have people in important positions who were basically weak or greedy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=267.58s)]
*  And the founders were worried that weak or greedy leaders could get bought off, could [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=273.9s)]
*  get compromised, even by something so easily and noticeable as blatant as a foreign gift. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  And so keep that in mind when you remember the Trump family is doing the kind of double [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=284.88s)]
*  dealing with these deals in the exact countries that Trump has prioritized on this first visit. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=290.06s)]
*  And so to connect the dots tonight, the founders did not leave it up to any one leader to decide [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=296.97999999999996s)]
*  when to take gifts. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=302.35999999999996s)]
*  They permanently limited any such foreign gifts in our Constitution. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=303.36s)]
*  You may have heard reference to this recently given the news this week. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=307.92s)]
*  And if a foreign country or king, which actually applies given that Qatar is run through a [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  monarchy, if a king tried offering any gift that wasn't, say, for the people or the country [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=315.68s)]
*  of the United States, but was actually just to try to corrupt one person, a politician [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=322.44s)]
*  or leader, the founders were going to ban that or make it very hard to do. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  The classic example would be France gifting the Statue of Liberty, the beautiful, beautiful [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  statue you see there, for the U.S. centennial. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=338.67999999999995s)]
*  That was a gift to the country, of course, not to any one politician. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=341.76s)]
*  It is indeed a public statue in New York that many people see still all these years later [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=345.28s)]
*  as a great iconic tourist attraction, which they can visit. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=350.64s)]
*  But remember, that was even that was approved by Congress. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=354.03999999999996s)]
*  And it wasn't a gift for the politician. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=360.12s)]
*  As for a king who would try to give a huge gift to an officer or even a president, well, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=362.56s)]
*  I'll remind you, U.S. officers under the Constitution cannot accept any president from any king or [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=367.92s)]
*  foreign state without the consent of Congress. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=374.66s)]
*  The founders viewed it as obvious that Congress would never approve big, lavish personal gifts, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=379.44s)]
*  let alone gigantic ones. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=385.32s)]
*  And thus, that limit meant you would have a check. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=386.59999999999997s)]
*  A rough count suggests the majority of senators today are already on record against this gift [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=392.24s)]
*  plan when you have the Democrats and several Republican senators who've already spoken out. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=397.48s)]
*  So it looks like by that whip count, Trump can't even clear this constitutional hurdle. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=404.24s)]
*  And that's even if his attorney general and former Qatar lobbyist says she likes the idea. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=409.28s)]
*  So that's the rule. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=415.32s)]
*  Now, Trump could be pushed to drop this plan from all of the blowback before it's even [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=416.32s)]
*  tested in court. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=420.56s)]
*  It is still significant because it shows you where his priorities are. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=422.18s)]
*  It shows you what he's trying to do. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=425.76s)]
*  It shows you in the clearest possible sense that this personal enrichment matters more [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=427.36s)]
*  than what the U.S. might get. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  Again, if you use the Statue of Liberty example, why not give the $400 million if it's for [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=435.92s)]
*  the taking to some public project? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=439.6s)]
*  Why not? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=443.44s)]
*  Because it's not about you. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=444.6s)]
*  It's not about the oath he took. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  It's clearly about him. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=448.52000000000004s)]
*  And because, as I mentioned this in our coverage here, because of the fact that it's so physical [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=450.20000000000005s)]
*  and visible and it's a jet, it seems to be having more blowback, especially among Republicans, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=454.16s)]
*  than other self-interested maneuvers, certainly more than the cryptocurrency, which feels [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=459.48s)]
*  kind of, you know, hard to track. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=463.20000000000005s)]
*  For his part, Trump has defensively argued that taking foreign gifts is, he argues, somehow [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=466.0s)]
*  quote, smart. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=471.56s)]
*  Well, the Constitution, the U.S. military, the CIA policies, they all disagree. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=473.0s)]
*  If you're defending the United States, if you're a general or a CIA spy, it's not considered [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=477.40000000000003s)]
*  smart to pocket the gifts, which, by the way, are obviously offered in all sorts of ways [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=481.56s)]
*  in which tough, strong public servants are supposed to resist because you don't want [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=487.92s)]
*  to be compromised. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=493.24s)]
*  Trump is now arguing that the Gulf states have bigger planes, maybe greater planes, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=494.92s)]
*  and he wants the U.S. to kind of keep up, he says, even if that means having what would [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=500.0s)]
*  become the first ever Qatar Force One, if you will. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=504.84s)]
*  This really is his argument. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=510.03999999999996s)]
*  It's his new talking point in an interview where even Fox News felt the need to bring [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  up the scandal. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  When you land and you see Saudi Arabia and you see UAE and you see Qatar and you see [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=519.0799999999999s)]
*  all these and they have these brand new Boeing 747s mostly and you see ours next to it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=524.9200000000001s)]
*  This is like a totally different plane. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=531.64s)]
*  It's much smaller. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=533.84s)]
*  We're the United States of America. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=534.84s)]
*  I believe that we should have the most impressive plane. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=536.4s)]
*  Yes, we've gone from what the rules are to the self-dealing to the sort of general statement [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=539.72s)]
*  that we should have the most impressive plane. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  First of all, if you think about what's been going on with inflation and the prices up [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=549.9200000000001s)]
*  and the tariff war, we don't see a lot of evidence that most Americans are thinking [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=553.74s)]
*  about who has the larger plane when they land in various foreign capitals. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=557.8199999999999s)]
*  Second of all, if you want a bigger plane and you run the United States, you can go [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=563.2199999999999s)]
*  down to Congress and get that legislated. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=567.78s)]
*  You can do it without any national security or espionage risk. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=570.76s)]
*  It's a classic Trump deflection where he starts trying to get people to talk about that and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=574.14s)]
*  the size of planes instead of the real issue, which is you have a leader who 110 days a [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=579.1s)]
*  in has been busy doing business deals with these very countries, making money with his [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=583.62s)]
*  family, selling a mean crypto coin that came out of thin air, getting transaction fees [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=589.22s)]
*  off that, working with the richest guy in the world, Elon Musk. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=593.82s)]
*  Seems like a lot of stuff that has nothing to do with your life, your wellbeing, and [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=597.98s)]
*  how your economy is affecting your life and family. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=601.86s)]
*  Now, this Trump jet, if you are keeping track, would dwarf literally every type of little [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=604.94s)]
*  gift that any president has ever taken, which as you can see, are down to the tune of a [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=612.38s)]
*  couple hundred K for Biden, Bush, a million. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=618.06s)]
*  A lot of those things are held in various public presentation areas. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=622.9s)]
*  None of them involve a 400 million dollar gift. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=627.42s)]
*  NBC also reports that there'd be a high cost to getting this thing done. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=634.1s)]
*  So when you take it all together, you don't choose when you follow the news and politics. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  We don't get to choose which issues breakthrough. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=645.48s)]
*  Indeed, there are people who are critics of Trump and human rights experts and democratic [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=649.0799999999999s)]
*  activists who say of all the things in these first 110 days, this is where we've heard [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=653.66s)]
*  more from Republican senators more quickly than picking up students off the street and [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=658.9s)]
*  allegedly appearing to target people based on their free speech and at times sending [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=665.6s)]
*  people to the wrong foreign prison and feeling like what is due process in America anymore? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=669.6800000000001s)]
*  Even just name one bundle of issues. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=674.44s)]
*  We're talking about the jet. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=677.12s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=679.0s)]
*  We don't choose. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=681.0s)]
*  We live through it together. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=683.0s)]
*  And certain people have certain reasons why they're more skeptical of Trump on this, that, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=685.64s)]
*  or the other thing. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=689.12s)]
*  It is very clear from the Republican response and the outrage and what now looks like an [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=690.32s)]
*  effort by Donald Trump to get out from under parts of this. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=694.16s)]
*  This one broke through because of the sheer blatant physical undeniable grift. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiU5XRXJTh0&t=697.5600000000001s)]
