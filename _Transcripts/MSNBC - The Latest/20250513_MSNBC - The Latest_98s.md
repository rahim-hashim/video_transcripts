**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU)
*  And now back to one of our breaking stories this hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=0.0s)]
*  You are looking at live images from the Senate floor right now, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  where Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is speaking. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=6.36s)]
*  He just announced that he will put a hold on all Justice [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=8.72s)]
*  Department nominees until he gets answers on why the DOJ [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=12.9s)]
*  signed off on allowing the president to accept a Qatari [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=16.46s)]
*  jet as the new Air Force One. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=19.92s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=21.96s)]
*  Without objection. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Madam President, news of the Qatari government [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=25.64s)]
*  gifting Donald Trump a $400 million private jet to use as [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=29.2s)]
*  Air Force One is so corrupt that even Putin would give a [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=35.64s)]
*  double take. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=39.84s)]
*  This is not just naked corruption. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=41.64s)]
*  It is also a grave national security threat. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=44.14s)]
*  So in light of the deeply troubling news of a possible [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=48.8s)]
*  Qatari-funded Air Force One and the reports that the Attorney [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=52.04s)]
*  General personally signed off on this clearly unethical deal, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=56.92s)]
*  I am announcing a hold on all DOJ political nominees until we [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=62.2s)]
*  get more answers. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=69.08s)]
*  Senator Schumer also called for Attorney General Pam Bondi to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=71.36s)]
*  testify about the arrangement. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp_6JbBaMU&t=75.16s)]
