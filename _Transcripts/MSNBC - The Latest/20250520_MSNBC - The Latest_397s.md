# Rep. McIver 'will not be the last person' Trump's DOJ indicts: Rep. Swalwell
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A)
*  Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell from California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=0.0s)]
*  He also serves on the House Judiciary Committee and Homeland Security Committees. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=4.28s)]
*  Congressman, thanks for being here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=8.16s)]
*  You called Congresswoman MacIver's arrest a red line and accused the administration [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=9.48s)]
*  of prosecuting Trump's perceived political enemies. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=13.92s)]
*  Let me read some of your posts. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=17.68s)]
*  You say, quote, this is just the beginning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=19.96s)]
*  We must take whatever we've done before to show dissent and go one rung higher. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=22.04s)]
*  What does that look like to you? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=28.44s)]
*  What are you prepared to do? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=29.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=30.94s)]
*  Well, first, as far as my colleagues and I, we are family. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=31.94s)]
*  And the way we see this is that if you mess with one person in the family, you mess with [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=36.3s)]
*  the entire family. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=41.18s)]
*  And so we all have LaMonica's back here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=42.18s)]
*  And we're with her. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=46.06s)]
*  And she's going to beat these charges, I promise you. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=47.06s)]
*  It probably won't even get to a jury. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=48.7s)]
*  A judge will probably throw it out. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=50.42s)]
*  And if a judge doesn't throw it out, a jury is going to throw it out. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=51.58s)]
*  prosecutor who has made decisions around cases like this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=55.42s)]
*  But two, to your viewers, if they can go after someone like Congresswoman MacIver, somebody [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=59.660000000000004s)]
*  who serves in an official office, who's doing her official duties, they are coming for you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=66.38s)]
*  And so the only way we can stop that is if we link arms and we go to the town squares [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=71.86s)]
*  and the town halls and peacefully dissent. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=76.22s)]
*  So more people, more places. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=79.56s)]
*  That's what we have to do. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=81.82000000000001s)]
*  We have a day of action coming on June 14. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=82.82000000000001s)]
*  No King's Day. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=84.34s)]
*  I'm going to be out in the community. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=85.34s)]
*  And I know other Americans are as well. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=87.26s)]
*  But the other part of this, if you want to just break down the facts, they let her in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=90.26s)]
*  the facility after there was an arrest of the mayor. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=94.54s)]
*  So if she was so violent, if she was such a threat, why did they let her in? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=98.62s)]
*  I mean, that's why this is such nonsense. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=101.98s)]
*  But she will not be the last person they seek to indict. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=105.26s)]
*  And that's what must concern all of us. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=107.5s)]
*  And that's why House Democrats are going to stick together to make sure that we see this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=109.18s)]
*  as a red line. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=113.86s)]
*  And again, she is facing the charges. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=114.86s)]
*  She's technically not been arrested. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=116.7s)]
*  She says she looks forward to her day in court. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=118.22s)]
*  But she's there, she says, for oversight. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=120.06s)]
*  This is congressional oversight. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=123.26s)]
*  That's something that is not only allowed, but it's the responsibility of Congress to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=125.46s)]
*  do when it comes to these different governmental agencies. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=130.7s)]
*  How is that supposed to work? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=133.88s)]
*  Well, typically we would be able to give them notice when we visit a facility. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=135.9s)]
*  And the law says you don't have to give them notice. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=140.14s)]
*  But they're not worthy of much of a heads up because of the amount of lies that they've [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=142.78s)]
*  told the American people and the amount of lies that they've been called out on by judges [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=146.94s)]
*  across the country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=150.89999999999998s)]
*  And last week we saw in the Homeland Security Committee, Secretary Noem would not even acknowledge [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=152.42s)]
*  that they are detaining somebody indefinitely at a death camp in El Salvador based on Photoshopped, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=157.33999999999997s)]
*  doctored evidence. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=164.26s)]
*  And so if they're willing to lie and doctored evidence to put someone in jail for an indefinite [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=165.46s)]
*  amount of time, we can't trust them. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  So we have to do our oversight duties. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  And she was in the right to go and do that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  And I promise you there's going to be more unnoticed visits by my colleagues where they [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=177.62s)]
*  show up and they better be let in. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=183.9s)]
*  You pointed out this sort of cognitive dissonance in terms of how this unfolded in that New [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=187.38s)]
*  York's mayor was arrested that day. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=192.34s)]
*  But now the charges against him are dropped. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=195.3s)]
*  What do you make of Congresswoman MacGyver then being charged for her actions on that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=198.66s)]
*  same day at that same demonstration? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=204.44s)]
*  But she wasn't arrested that day. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=207.26s)]
*  How do you square it? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=210.06s)]
*  It's complete political theater. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=212.06s)]
*  And the U.S. attorney who's not even confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Haba, is completely unqualified. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=213.78s)]
*  She has no idea what she's doing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=221.58s)]
*  We saw this when she represented Donald Trump, the citizen, where he lost multiple cases [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=222.78s)]
*  under her representation. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=227.9s)]
*  She was called out by the court a number of times for not knowing the rules of evidence [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=229.82s)]
*  and other procedures. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=233.70000000000002s)]
*  So that's why I think a judge is probably going to throw this out. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=235.06s)]
*  But they would, you're going to see a jury throw it out if it makes it to a jury. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=238.34s)]
*  This will not meet the test of beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=242.58s)]
*  So these are charges or a complaint, criminal complaint, just to make sure our viewers understand [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=246.22s)]
*  this has to go before a jury for an indictment that grand jury would then bring forward the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  indictment. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=255.5s)]
*  This morning there on Capitol Hill, we were just covering the president trying to shore [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=256.7s)]
*  up his support with his Republican allies there on this big, beautiful bill. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=260.26s)]
*  Some in the more conservative wing of this party say they want to see more cuts to benefits [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=265.82s)]
*  like Medicaid. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=269.76s)]
*  What say you? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=270.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump is visiting Congress this morning when he should be visiting a grocery [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=272.5s)]
*  store or a Home Depot, because right now Americans want to know, what are you going [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=277.26s)]
*  to do to bring down the costs of our goods? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=280.86s)]
*  I had a birthday party over the weekend for my eight year old and I had to make an emergency [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=283.7s)]
*  trip to Home Depot to fix a leaky garden hose for a backyard pool party. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=288.82s)]
*  And I was stunned to see two things. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=293.62s)]
*  One, the prices are certainly going up. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=295.9s)]
*  But two, how empty the Home Depot was on a weekend. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=298.53999999999996s)]
*  And most people who go to Home Depot know that's the worst time to go. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  That's when people are doing their weekend backyard activities. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=304.76s)]
*  So Americans are fueling these costs and they want a president who sees them and is going [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=308.88s)]
*  to do something to bring them down. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=313.4s)]
*  This bill is only going to help the richest among us by taking away from the least capable [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=315.0s)]
*  to afford health care among us. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=322.32s)]
*  And so I'm going to vote against it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=324.08s)]
*  And there are still Republicans right now who are not so sure that they want to take [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=325.8s)]
*  this vote. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=329.56s)]
*  The president said Democrats want to increase taxes by 68 percent. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=330.68s)]
*  He also said only he and Republicans are trying to cut costs of drug prices. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=335.36s)]
*  He claims that by up to 85 percent. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=341.2s)]
*  Just want to give you a chance to respond to those specific. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=343.16s)]
*  He should bring that bill to the to the Congress. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=346.36s)]
*  I would vote to reduce health care prices by 85 percent. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=348.52s)]
*  The problem is his Republican friends in Congress, they don't want that bill. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=352.52s)]
*  And many of Donald Trump supporters don't want that bill. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=357.36s)]
*  I'm absolutely for it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=360.76s)]
*  We should make that a law. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  But he's just cheap talk and no action. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=363.44s)]
*  And that's why you'll never see us take a vote on that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=367.2s)]
*  He could put that in the reconciliation bill and you'd have at least one Democratic vote [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=369.0s)]
*  right here. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=372.44s)]
*  Congressman Eric Swalwell, appreciate your time. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=373.44s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jIe-UzE2A&t=375.04s)]
