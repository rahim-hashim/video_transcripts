# BREAKING: Supreme Court blocks some deportations under the Alien Enemies Act
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM)
*  We have some breaking news to tell you about from the United States Supreme Court. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=0.0s)]
*  Moments ago, in a 7-2 decision, the justices blocked the Trump administration from deporting [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=6.12s)]
*  a group of Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  It is a complicated ruling, with the court asking a lower court to make some big decisions. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=15.88s)]
*  But it is nonetheless a legal setback for the Trump administration, who wants to use [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=21.46s)]
*  the Alien Enemies Act to deport more migrants without standard due process. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=26.7s)]
*  Joining us to help us understand this breaking news is MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=32.14s)]
*  Charlie is with us as well. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=38.22s)]
*  Nicole, I should always know better than to put my hair on a ponytail on a Friday night [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=39.74s)]
*  because that's just asking for the Supreme Court to come to us. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=43.42s)]
*  This decision, you mentioned due process, this decision is the court saying again that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=48.14s)]
*  people who are immigrants, even if they are undocumented immigrants, even if they are [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=53.34s)]
*  alleged members of a Venezuelan gang, are entitled to that due process. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=57.14s)]
*  The court is refusing here to say exactly how much notice somebody who is an alleged [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=62.02s)]
*  member of Tren de Agua is entitled to. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=67.5s)]
*  But what they are saying is, we're going to continue our prior order that prevents the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=70.10000000000001s)]
*  administration from taking a group of people that are being held in a detention facility [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=74.38s)]
*  in a certain area of Texas. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=79.34s)]
*  These are the people that were previously boarded on buses that NBC News literally chased [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=81.1s)]
*  on their way up the highway to an airport and back around again. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=86.17999999999999s)]
*  They cannot take those folks, put them on a plane to El Salvador. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=90.78s)]
*  And the reason they can't do that is because the court wants a lower court to decide two [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=94.89999999999999s)]
*  things. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=99.82s)]
*  How likely are the plaintiffs to succeed in their argument that the Alien Enemies Act [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=100.82s)]
*  is not fairly applied to them? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=105.58s)]
*  What does the Alien Enemies Act mean, for example, when it talks about a predatory [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=107.82s)]
*  incursion or an invasion or a war? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=112.13999999999999s)]
*  Has Trump fairly applied it to this set of facts? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=115.13999999999999s)]
*  They want the lower court to decide, are the plaintiffs likely to succeed on that? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=118.5s)]
*  The second thing they want the appeals court to decide is how much notice these people [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  are entitled to. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=126.28s)]
*  And the Supreme Court is saying emphatically here, whatever that number is, 24 hours ain't [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=127.28s)]
*  enough. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=132.98s)]
*  Go back to the drawing board and decide. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=133.98s)]
*  And the final thing that they're saying, and this is really important, is that this injunction [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=137.22s)]
*  that they're continuing right now is going to last for some time. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=142.34s)]
*  It's going to last until that lower court, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, not only [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=146.78s)]
*  makes its decision, but until any petition for review by the Supreme Court is disposed [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  of. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=156.94s)]
*  We're used to thinking about all of these emergency cases that are percolating through [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=157.94s)]
*  the court. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=162.22s)]
*  We both know in the ordinary course, it takes a long time for a case to go through the traditional [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=163.26s)]
*  appeals process. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=168.9s)]
*  So this is a sign to the Trump administration, not only can't you do this now, but you might [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=170.26s)]
*  be stymied in doing this to this particular group of people for months to come. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=174.3s)]
*  And you can't go into any other court in the country where you might have detainees and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=179.1s)]
*  allege that 24 hours notice is going to be enough to give people the due process that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=183.94s)]
*  the court here, a seven-person majority on this court, is reasserting, is imperative [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=189.06s)]
*  to give not only to citizens, not only to undocumented immigrants, but even to alleged [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=194.61999999999998s)]
*  members of Tren Te Aragua. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=199.54s)]
*  OK, let me ask you three questions. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=200.94s)]
*  One, does this only protect from deportation to El Salvador the people who were... [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=202.89999999999998s)]
*  I mean, does this do anything for the people that they already used the Alien Enemies Act [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=210.14s)]
*  to send to this brutal prison in El Salvador? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=217.94s)]
*  Those people are being, I don't want to say dealt with, but there is a separate court [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=218.94s)]
*  proceeding still in front of James Boasberg, who's the district court judge who originally [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=223.34s)]
*  had Alien Enemies Act proceedings in front of him. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=228.02s)]
*  And one of the things that is being decided before him is, does he have jurisdiction even [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=231.06s)]
*  over the claims of people who are now in CCOTS or other facilities in El Salvador? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=237.1s)]
*  But he all... [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=241.82s)]
*  I mean, so this was about the Supreme Court telling those... [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=242.82s)]
*  And Von Hilliard, I think, was doing that great reporting to turn the buses around, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=246.10000000000002s)]
*  that you couldn't send them out. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=249.82000000000002s)]
*  Boasberg also said, turn the planes around. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=250.82000000000002s)]
*  Boasberg did say turn the planes around, and he was about to engage in some discovery about [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=253.74s)]
*  who was being contemptuous of his order when the Supreme Court vacated that order that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=260.42s)]
*  he had issued saying, turn the planes around. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=266.58s)]
*  Well, now the plaintiffs have come back before him, people representing those people who [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=268.62s)]
*  were now in El Salvador, and essentially said, okay, the Supreme Court told us that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=272.74s)]
*  we had to file these cases in the places people were detained. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=276.90000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, we can't do that for people who are in El Salvador already, and we have to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  file these cases in a particular way. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=285.3s)]
*  We have to bring them as habeas corpus petition. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=286.98s)]
*  So we're going to do that for you now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=289.58s)]
*  And Boasberg has said to them, first I have to figure out whether I have jurisdiction. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=291.78000000000003s)]
*  And what that turns on is, does the United States have what he calls constructive custody [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=296.5s)]
*  over these people in El Salvador? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  It depends on, is the U.S. sufficiently in control of them, even though, nominally speaking, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  they're in El Salvador? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=309.2s)]
*  And he, at the last hearing, quoted back to the government lawyer, Trump's interview with [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  our colleague Kristen Welker, and a number of other statements from folks in the administration [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=314.92s)]
*  that he said are a good indicator that the United States, despite all the kabuki theater [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  we've seen in Oval Office Press availabilities, that yes, the United States does have constructive [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=325.04s)]
*  custody, but that issue has not yet been decided. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=331.28s)]
*  Stay tuned for that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  So, Charlie, I mean, what we have here is an instance where the Supreme Court is saying [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  some of the same things that protesters at Chuck Grassley's town halls are saying, which [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  is due process, that we, and I know it's a very low bar, but we do still have today a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=347.84s)]
*  7-2 ruling that is in the vein of affirming due process rights in this country, even for [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=354.23999999999995s)]
*  people here illegally, as Lisa Rubin just said, even for people who are accused but [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=360.76s)]
*  not proven to be members of a gang. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=364.8s)]
*  That seems to be a very, very important point. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=369.4s)]
*  Lisa explained this very, very well. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=371.32s)]
*  I have a very quick question, though. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=373.52s)]
*  Was it 7-2, or really was it 8-1? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=375.12s)]
*  Because I'm just looking very, very quickly at it, and I'm not the lawyer here, but it [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  looks like Justice Kavanaugh wrote a concurring opinion, and only Justice Alito wrote a dissent, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=381.96s)]
*  which would suggest that you have seven or eight of the Supreme Court justices that say, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=387.96s)]
*  wait, we are not prepared to ignore due process, and that this would come down basically a [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=392.91999999999996s)]
*  week after Stephen Miller rolls out of the White House and says they are seriously considering [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=398.52s)]
*  suspending habeas corpus. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=403.21999999999997s)]
*  And the court is certainly sending, the majority of the court, saying a very clear message [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=405.28s)]
*  that no, we are not prepared to ignore due process rights for these migrants. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=410.24s)]
*  So I think that the number of justices that signed on to this, the speed with which the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=417.20000000000005s)]
*  court acted, really does send a signal that, in fact, people do care about due process, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=422.12s)]
*  and that the court is going to draw a red line. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=428.88000000000005s)]
*  They may give Donald Trump, in other cases, things that he wants, but in this case, they [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  have been relatively consistent, I think, in at least trying to send, fire these shots [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=436.20000000000005s)]
*  across the bow that, no, sorry, not on our watch. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=442.32s)]
*  We're not going to be doing this. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=446.04s)]
*  Well, Charlie, to answer your question about how the split was, the dissent by Justice [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=447.36s)]
*  Alito is also signed by Justice Thomas. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=452.08s)]
*  I want to go to your point, though, about Justice Kavanaugh is well taken, because one [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=454.96s)]
*  of the things Justice Kavanaugh does is he would actually go further than the court was. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=459.68s)]
*  He basically says, look, there's no reason not to engage with the merits right now. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=463.8s)]
*  The circumstances I'm going to read from the last paragraph of his concurrence, if [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=469.08s)]
*  you'll forgive me this, the circumstances call for a prompt and final resolution, which [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=472.28s)]
*  likely can be provided only by this court at this juncture. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=476.76s)]
*  I would prefer not to remand to the lower court and further put off this court's final [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=480.59999999999997s)]
*  resolution of the critical legal issues. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=484.53999999999996s)]
*  We saw shades of that yesterday in the birthright citizenship argument, where you saw folks [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=487.47999999999996s)]
*  from Justice Kagan, Justice Jackson, essentially saying, why are you before us here on this [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=492.64s)]
*  procedural issue when we could be dealing with the substance? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jszq9XWnvM&t=498.28s)]
