# Catholic Church in U.S. facing shortage of priests
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ)
*  A new pope will lead a church that is growing around the world, especially in Africa, where [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the number of Catholics grew 3.3% just from 2022 to 2023. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=5.08s)]
*  But it is also a church facing a crisis of vocations in the U.S., a challenge for the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=11.18s)]
*  church to have enough priests for all of its parishes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=16.22s)]
*  So what does this global growth and domestic shortage mean for the future of Catholic life [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=19.42s)]
*  in America? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=24.68s)]
*  And will cardinals in the conclave choose someone who can inspire young men to go to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=26.04s)]
*  the seminary? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=31.0s)]
*  John Bowles was a pre-med graduate from UCLA doing research when those plans took a major [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=33.4s)]
*  detour. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=39.2s)]
*  What made you want to become a priest? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=40.2s)]
*  Good question, but there's no simple answer to that question. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  His story does fit the profile of young men entering the priesthood these days. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  Like nearly all seminarians, Bowles has two Catholic parents. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=52.96s)]
*  His are converts. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=56.96s)]
*  And like nearly 70%, he had a full-time job before entering the seminary and was planning [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=58.68s)]
*  a different life. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=64.3s)]
*  The idea of having a happy Christian family has always been something that's been very [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=66.3s)]
*  attractive. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=70.48s)]
*  The second of nine children, Bowles was a faithful mass-goer. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=71.48s)]
*  Still, his decision shocked even close friends. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=75.0s)]
*  He said, are you crazy? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=78.48s)]
*  I said, I don't know yet. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=80.76s)]
*  Actually, the woman sitting next to us, she was eavesdropping and she leaned in and said, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=82.04s)]
*  you know, the world needs doctors just as much as they need priests. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=86.4s)]
*  The need for priests is in fact great. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=89.28s)]
*  In the U.S., there's just one priest for every 3,000 parishioners. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=92.06s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=96.56s)]
*  U.S. vocations fell way off, by nearly 50% between 1970 and 1990. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=97.56s)]
*  Since then, though, they've leveled, averaging 428 per year. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=104.28s)]
*  Really, it stopped with John Paul II. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=108.4s)]
*  John Paul was hugely important in putting brakes on what might have seemed like freefall [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  and vocations, the vocations of the priesthood. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=118.2s)]
*  That freefall ended. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=121.12s)]
*  But more priests are now retiring or dying than joining the priesthood. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  And the number of U.S. Catholics is growing from almost 48 million in 1970 to nearly 67 [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=127.98s)]
*  million in 2021. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  There are fewer parishioners in fewer parishes, and there's just not enough priests to serve them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=138.12s)]
*  Take Chicago. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=143.12s)]
*  Just two new priests ordained in 2022, while nearly 50 years ago, the seminary class was [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=144.48s)]
*  40. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=151.0s)]
*  And the 344 parishes Chicago had in 2018, four years later, it dropped to 221. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=152.0s)]
*  In New Orleans, when Monsignor Christopher Nalte came to Good Shepherd Parish, his first [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  job was to merge with two other parishes, devastating many parishioners. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  It's a strong attachment, especially for old, old churches. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=169.56s)]
*  And the feelings and the connection to a parish and where you lived or where your parents [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=173.16000000000003s)]
*  lived, your grandparents and great-grandparents, in some cases, lived. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  Emotional, financial and spiritual challenges that point to the need for more vocations [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=182.44s)]
*  at a time when the priesthood can seem anachronistic, a calling battered by the sex abuse scandal. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=187.36s)]
*  And those who do answer the call, like Bowles and Stephen Dardis in Louisiana, often spend [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  many years trying, essentially, to talk themselves out of it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=198.6s)]
*  Just the fear that you won't be able to do it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=202.88s)]
*  The fear that obedience might be difficult, the celibate lifestyle might be difficult. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=204.92s)]
*  Well, they are, aren't they? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=209.92s)]
*  They are a little difficult. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=210.92s)]
*  But as I've walked with married couples a lot, I've also come to appreciate everyone's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=211.92s)]
*  got a struggle in some way. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=216.92s)]
*  It's impossible to quantify how many more men might become priests if they could marry, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=219.32000000000002s)]
*  or women if they were allowed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=223.88s)]
*  But neither Pope Benedict or Francis seriously ever suggested that could happen. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  Instead, many U.S. parishes now have priests from Africa and Latin America where ordinations [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  are on the rise, while the U.S. looks to the young priests it does have to inspire the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  next generation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  You're so excited. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  Do you think you'll be this excited 10 or 20 years from now? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  I think I'll be more tired. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=247.38s)]
*  I will do my best. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=249.74s)]
*  And every single priest out there will do his best. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=251.48s)]
*  Joining me now is Catholic University Associate Professor of Practice and Director of the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=255.82s)]
*  Doctorate Program of Ministry, Susan Timoni. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=260.86s)]
*  It's so good to see you, Susan. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=264.14s)]
*  Do you think Cardinals in the Conclave will be looking to choose someone to inspire? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=266.02s)]
*  And by inspire, I mean inspire more young men to go to the seminary. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=271.86s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=277.86s)]
*  Yes, I think that's the short answer to the question because you see so many more bishops [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=279.46000000000004s)]
*  making vocations work a priority, making sure they send some of their best priests to be [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=284.5s)]
*  chaplains on college campuses, making sure they have robust young adult programs, because [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=289.72s)]
*  these are the entry points, the places where they can begin to have those conversations [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=295.62s)]
*  to invite young men to think about the priesthood. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=300.82s)]
*  And I think to have someone who himself is inspiring as a man who loves to preach the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=303.42s)]
*  gospel, who loves to serve God's people, that's what they want to see, right, in the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=307.66s)]
*  pope as well. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=312.38s)]
*  One of the things I talked to Amansi or Nalte about was that so many of the people who are [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=313.38s)]
*  the most faithful mass goers, the most faithful contributors are older. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=320.46000000000004s)]
*  They remember a church where there wasn't just maybe one priest, but maybe two, where [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=325.34s)]
*  they were always there when they got a phone call. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=331.29999999999995s)]
*  That doesn't exist anymore. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=334.65999999999997s)]
*  Does there need to be an adjustment in the way Catholics think about their priests or [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=337.06s)]
*  do they just need to figure out a way to get more guys to go to the seminary? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=341.82s)]
*  It might be a little bit of both. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=346.97999999999996s)]
*  And I teach a course on the theology of pastoral leadership for seminarians. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=350.14s)]
*  And I talk about the need to be able to think about the way they can engage lay people who [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=354.66s)]
*  have specific skills and talents who can assist them. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=360.22s)]
*  Who are the people in your parish that make really good folks to, along with you, go and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=364.78s)]
*  visit parishioners who are sick? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=369.94s)]
*  Who are the people in your parish who are dynamic, who can coordinate youth groups, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=372.12s)]
*  who can teach in our religious education classes? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=376.9s)]
*  So it's a real opportunity for them to be able to say, hey, I've got some partners in [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=380.14s)]
*  this work that I'm called to do. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=384.86s)]
*  And we can do this together and create a real sense of community within the parish. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=386.74s)]
*  And so that people see many gifts coming forward with the priest and with the other pastoral [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=391.42s)]
*  leaders in the parish. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=396.58s)]
*  The biggest question I get and a lot of the priests I talk to get is the discussion about [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=399.9s)]
*  whether the church should allow priests to marry and or open up the priesthood to women. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=404.78s)]
*  I mentioned that neither Pope Benedict nor Pope Francis made moves to do that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=411.05999999999995s)]
*  And the question that many Americans have is why? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=416.05999999999995s)]
*  Can you answer that? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  I think so. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=422.73999999999995s)]
*  I think there's been a really consistent teaching in the church that the priest acts in the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=423.73999999999995s)]
*  person of Christ. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=429.61999999999995s)]
*  And so it makes sense for Christ, who was fully human and fully divine, in fact was [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=431.26s)]
*  a man. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=436.86s)]
*  And so this beauty of this relationship of men acting in persona Christi as priests is [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=437.86s)]
*  really at the core of how we understand the vocation and the mission of our priests. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=447.82s)]
*  That said, I think it's an opportunity also to say while they exercise certain gifts within [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=453.86s)]
*  the context of who they are as priests, we know that there's many other ways we can call [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=460.34s)]
*  men and women forward to be healers, to be teachers, to be preachers. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  And so I like to look at it as what's the complementarity of the roles of pastoral leadership [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=471.41999999999996s)]
*  in the church? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=476.9s)]
*  The priest has one role that's central and really important, and then it's complemented [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=478.23999999999995s)]
*  by these other roles. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=482.9s)]
*  And so I think that's the way the church teacher thinks about it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=485.78s)]
*  I should at least acknowledge that in some Jesuit parishes, they had what they called [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BsBmeZ5VQ&t=490.97999999999996s)]
