# ‘Waiting for the other shoe to drop’: Inflation rose less than expected despite tariff turmoil
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg)
*  Well, the May inflation report is out and it shows consumer prices rose less than expected [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=0.0s)]
*  last month despite the ongoing fears over President Trump's tariffs. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=4.66s)]
*  We want to bring in NBC senior business correspondent Christine Romans and here with us in the studio, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=8.92s)]
*  Courtney Brown, senior economics reporter for Axios. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=13.68s)]
*  Christine, I want to start with you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=16.48s)]
*  Can you break down the numbers for us and what this is going to mean for most Americans' [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=18.16s)]
*  bottom line? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=21.52s)]
*  So basically we saw inflation, the inflation rate 2.4 percent. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=22.6s)]
*  That means prices rising from year on year 2.4 percent. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=26.68s)]
*  That's really right in line with what a lot of people have been expecting. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=30.84s)]
*  And from April to May, up just 0.1 percent. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=34.08s)]
*  When you look within the numbers, you could see price declines for things like energy, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=36.8s)]
*  gas prices. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=40.56s)]
*  Gas right now is down 30 cents a gallon from where it was last year. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=41.56s)]
*  So that's something that, you know, everyday consumers have probably been noticing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  But keeping that number still higher than the Federal Reserve would like and still higher [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=50.04s)]
*  than normal is shelter. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=54.16s)]
*  So prices have still been quite high and stayed that way. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=56.14s)]
*  And Courtney, I want to ask you, you just posted a piece and we referenced it earlier, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=60.54s)]
*  Trump's waiting for good dough economy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=64.78s)]
*  That's too classy for me. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=66.94s)]
*  I'm more like waiting for Goffman. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=67.94s)]
*  But we were talking earlier about how you're saying you're just not seeing the impacts, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=69.58s)]
*  the expected impacts of these policies. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  Why is that and what else does it tell us? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=76.0s)]
*  All across Wall Street, economists expect that either the economy will slow, inflation [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=78.02000000000001s)]
*  will rise or some combination of both. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=83.34s)]
*  And as far as the economic data is concerned, we just haven't seen it yet. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=86.86s)]
*  Today's inflation numbers are mild. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=91.10000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure the Federal Reserve is breathing a sigh of relief. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=93.54s)]
*  And so we're all just waiting for this shoe to drop. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=97.02000000000001s)]
*  And months now we haven't seen it yet. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=100.98s)]
*  So what's going on? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=104.94s)]
*  What's going on is companies have stocked up a bunch of inventory, right? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=105.78s)]
*  They brought in a bunch of stuff from overseas. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=110.22s)]
*  And did they do that when that pause went into effect? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=112.82000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=114.66s)]
*  Or even before tariffs were set to take effect. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=115.42s)]
*  So you have all of this pre-tariff inventory, not subject to potential price hikes for consumers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=118.58s)]
*  But what's happening is businesses are running down that inventory. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=126.18s)]
*  The momentum is kind of running out. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=130.5s)]
*  Well, yeah, and they're just running out of stuff. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=132.02s)]
*  So they're selling through it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=134.38s)]
*  So the expectation is that eventually in the months ahead, as businesses run down that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=136.26s)]
*  pre-tariff inventory, if you will, we are going to see some price hikes on consumers. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=141.98s)]
*  But haven't seen it yet. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=147.94s)]
*  OK, Christine, the other breaking news I want to ask you about is President Trump says [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=149.38s)]
*  the U.S. will keep tariffs high on Chinese goods. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=153.62s)]
*  He's touting this preliminary trade agreement with China that, of course, still needs final [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=156.98s)]
*  approval. What is the significance for everyday items we get from China? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=160.7s)]
*  The mixed messages. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=165.5s)]
*  And for businesses here at home, what do they do? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=166.7s)]
*  I mean, look, 55 percent tariffs on things coming in from China. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=169.9s)]
*  That is significant, Christina, and that is going to have a big effect for any importer, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=173.45999999999998s)]
*  any small business that's relying on parts and goods that are coming from China. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=178.42s)]
*  These are still pretty high tariff levels, 55 percent on imports from China. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=182.26s)]
*  And then the Chinese are taxing American goods at 10 percent. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  You know, the Commerce Secretary was talking about this earlier today. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=190.06s)]
*  And you know, really what we want to know is there going to be certainty where these [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=193.38s)]
*  tariff rates are so people, companies can start making plans later this fall. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=197.46s)]
*  This is what he said. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=201.5s)]
*  They've agreed we're going to examine how China can do more business with us. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=204.42s)]
*  You know, we've got a giant trade deficit. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=208.9s)]
*  How about China? You buy more of our agriculture, you buy more of our equipment. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=211.01999999999998s)]
*  And I think they've agreed to that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=216.78s)]
*  We're going to go through that over the next couple of months. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=218.62s)]
*  But this feels very, very positive. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=220.82s)]
*  Well, Mr. Secretary, it's potentially very good for the markets if they can be convinced [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=224.66s)]
*  that these numbers, these tariff levels are not going to change from here. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=229.3s)]
*  Can we say that? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=232.9s)]
*  You can definitely say that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=234.34s)]
*  OK, so we'll see. It sounds like there's going to be more talking, Christina, in the days [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=236.9s)]
*  and months ahead. You know, the president said this deal with China is done. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=240.02s)]
*  This is not done like a traditional deal. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=242.9s)]
*  This is a handshake in Geneva. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  Now maybe some social media posts about it from the U.S. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=246.62s)]
*  side, some vague language on the Chinese side. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=250.22s)]
*  This isn't this isn't a papered up deal like we're used to. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=253.58s)]
*  And Courtney, the president seized on the new inflation report to once again press [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=256.94s)]
*  Fed chair Jerome Powell to slash interest rates. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=262.1s)]
*  Do you think that's going to happen or do you think he's going to stick to his guns [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=265.94s)]
*  despite this immense pressure he's getting from the White House? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=269.82s)]
*  The Federal Reserve holds its two day policy meeting next week. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=272.1s)]
*  It ends on Wednesday. No interest rate change is expected. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=275.34s)]
*  But what we do get, which is super important, we get a set of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=279.78s)]
*  new economic projections that show how the Fed sees inflation and employment [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=283.38s)]
*  and broader economic growth developing in the months and years ahead. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  And that will kind of give us a clue of how the Federal Reserve sees adjusting [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=293.38s)]
*  interest rates in the near term. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=298.3s)]
*  But for now, they're very much in this wait and see approach. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=300.5s)]
*  They want to see how trade tensions play out. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=303.86s)]
*  They want to see how the economic data is developing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=306.58s)]
*  But what's interesting today is we didn't just have President Trump calling on the Fed [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=310.1s)]
*  to cut rates. We saw Vice President J.D. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=314.18s)]
*  Vance get on the action to pressing Powell to lower interest rates. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=316.70000000000005s)]
*  So a little bit of double teaming in the Fed on the Fed here. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=321.62s)]
*  All right. We'll see if it makes any difference. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=324.86s)]
*  Gartney Brown, Christine Romans, thank you both so much for joining us. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTr0VK_OMQg&t=326.90000000000003s)]
