# ‘This is just nutty’: Trump says he wants to rebuild Alcatraz to hold ‘ruthless’ offenders
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI)
*  I want to bring in NBC's Vaughn Hilliard covering the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=0.0s)]
*  Stuart Stevens is senior advisor to the Lincoln Project. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=3.84s)]
*  He helped lead Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign and is author of the book It Was All a Lie. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=6.72s)]
*  Donna Edwards is a former Democratic congresswoman from Maryland and an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=12.24s)]
*  Stuart, how seriously should we take the president when he responds to a question about upholding [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=17.72s)]
*  the Constitution by saying, I don't know, is that just, I don't know, messaging? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=23.26s)]
*  Is it something more? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=29.46s)]
*  Listen, we have the president, it's exactly what you said, we have the president of the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=30.66s)]
*  United States saying that he's not sure that he's going to uphold the Constitution, which [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=35.38s)]
*  by the way, he took an oath, put his hand on the Bible and swore that he would uphold. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=38.46s)]
*  That is the major job of the president of the United States. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=43.72s)]
*  So you know, I think if we get conditioned that we just sort of say, well, that's just [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=47.84s)]
*  I think that's dumbing down what deviancy, as Monahan said, we just can't accept that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=52.62s)]
*  We have to take it seriously. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=61.14s)]
*  And we see that his actions are, he says he wants to deport the homegrown. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=62.699999999999996s)]
*  He's already deported American citizens, tried to deport American citizens. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  He's kind of disappeared them. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=70.58s)]
*  This is very serious. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=72.86s)]
*  And there's this sort of human instinct not to see it as that serious, because we want [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=74.34s)]
*  to go about our business. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=78.44s)]
*  But we don't have the luxury of that because we don't have a president who believes that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=80.22s)]
*  he is elected to uphold the Constitution. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=84.14s)]
*  He obviously doesn't believe there's a downside to this congresswoman. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=88.38s)]
*  So now that Democrats literally have him on tape, right, questioning the constitutional [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=91.86s)]
*  process and in particular, in deportation cases, what do they do with it? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  Well, look, I think it's actually important to like replay this point over all the things [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=104.98s)]
*  in that interview. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=109.98s)]
*  That was the most those comments were the most troubling. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=111.5s)]
*  The president reviews a constitutional guarantee of due process as an inconvenience because [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=114.30000000000001s)]
*  people would be held to be entitled to a trial. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=121.38000000000001s)]
*  I think that this is really a scary moment. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=125.66000000000001s)]
*  He's already demonstrated his willingness to disobey court orders, to delay implementing [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=128.66s)]
*  court orders, a complete disregard of the rule of law. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=134.94s)]
*  We can't, I think, as Stuart says, we can't just sort of pass over this and go, oh, that's [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  Trump being Trump. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=143.86s)]
*  It's really imperative for Democrats to help the American people understand that this president [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=145.06s)]
*  has no regard for rule of law, doesn't care about the Constitution if it's inconvenient [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=150.34s)]
*  for him, and would easily trample on the rights not just of immigrants, but the rights of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=156.5s)]
*  U.S. citizens. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=163.62s)]
*  So I think this is a scary moment and it's a wake up call not to just let this pass by. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=164.46s)]
*  He's gotten so much pushback, Vaughn, about El Salvador. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=171.34s)]
*  Now he seems to want to put at least some of the worst of the worst, as he likes to call [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=175.58s)]
*  them, at Alcatraz. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=179.82s)]
*  I mean, is that real? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=181.82s)]
*  Is he just spitballing? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=183.3s)]
*  Do we know? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=184.54000000000002s)]
*  Right. The top line of this is that the president wants to detain and incarcerate and or deport [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  more individuals than currently the U.S. federal prison system has the capacity to fulfill. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=193.06s)]
*  That is why we saw him sign and invoke the Alien Enemies Act in order to more swiftly send [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=200.5s)]
*  undocumented individuals outside of the United States. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=208.26s)]
*  And yet we know, based off of our own reporting at NBC News over the year, that the federal [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=211.78s)]
*  prison system through the Bureau of Prisons continues to face staffing shortages, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=217.38s)]
*  particularly of guards. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=222.1s)]
*  We have been out to the Florence Correctional Facility, one of the 17 supermax facilities [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=223.38s)]
*  out in Colorado, for instance, where they continue to face an overwhelming number of inmates [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=228.42s)]
*  to guards that are able to effectively oversee these facilities. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=234.42s)]
*  And yet what you're hearing from the president and his desire to open up a new facility on [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=238.42s)]
*  Alcatraz, the specifics of it are not clear and the White House has not provided any details [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=242.5s)]
*  about how they would fund or effectively rebuild this facility that closed down more than 60 years [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=247.94000000000003s)]
*  ago. But here was the president talking about it last night. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=253.3s)]
*  So many of these radicalized judges, they want to have trials for every single thing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=258.1s)]
*  Every single person that's in our country illegally, they came in illegally. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=264.42s)]
*  That would mean millions of trials. And it's just so ridiculous what's happening. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=268.74s)]
*  And it's long been a symbol, Alcatraz, of whatever it is. I mean, it's a sad symbol, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=273.78s)]
*  but it's a symbol of law and order. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=281.21999999999997s)]
*  Now, of course, we heard him rebuff the idea of potentially due process for undocumented [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=285.3s)]
*  individuals in the country. His own deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, here just today in the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=290.18s)]
*  social media post suggested that undocumented individuals are not guaranteed due process in [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=295.14s)]
*  the Constitution. It's very explicit that due process is guaranteed for all persons. It doesn't [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=301.46s)]
*  say citizens specifically here, but what you have is the president seeking to detain and incarcerate [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=307.21999999999997s)]
*  or deport more individuals than what the system currently allows for and at the pace that he does [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=313.62s)]
*  not desire. And Donna, if you go back to when they closed Alcatraz back in 1963, there were two main [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=318.9s)]
*  reasons. One, it was falling apart and it was going to cost an awful lot of money in dollars [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=325.46s)]
*  at that time to repair it. And number two, it was really expensive to run. They had to fly everything [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=331.06s)]
*  in there. They had to find food, even drinkable water. You have to get staff in and off of it, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=336.98s)]
*  right? So there's no clear idea, as Juan points out, how much this might cost. So even if it was [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=342.42s)]
*  a serious proposal, how do you make that proposal at a time when what you're saying to America is, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=350.90000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to save you money? Well, look, the president of the United States, Juan doesn't [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=358.1s)]
*  consider the cost, but he thinks it's actually more important for Americans to pay 145, 140% [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=365.70000000000005s)]
*  more on consumer goods than it is to put that into the cost of running an Alcatraz. Alcatraz was [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=372.82000000000005s)]
*  incredibly expensive, not just the maintenance that needed to bring it up to scale in the 21st [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=380.66s)]
*  century, but the ongoing maintenance as a facility. It only ever housed about 300 persons there anyway, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=387.94s)]
*  and so it's just not workable. And I don't think it's a serious proposal. I think it's another one [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=398.82000000000005s)]
*  of these things where the rest of us were doing something on Sunday evening and the president [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=404.26000000000005s)]
*  of the United States was consumed by Alcaraz. So it doesn't make sense financially. It is not [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=408.42s)]
*  workable as a prison facility, and the worst of the worst, frankly, are housed in our state prisons [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=415.3s)]
*  and not in the federal system. So this is really not a serious proposal at all. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=422.42s)]
*  So what it does bring up, though, Stuart, because when the president brought up this idea of [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=427.70000000000005s)]
*  reopening Alcatraz, he said basically the same thing he said to Kristen Welker about people [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=431.54s)]
*  facing deportation, which is that there's no way you can give all these people a hearing. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=435.86s)]
*  There's no way they...he clearly thinks that the worst of the worst should necessarily have to go [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=440.66s)]
*  through due process. So not a political issue, but a practical issue. Is that message [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=446.02000000000004s)]
*  going to fly among even Republicans? Well, look, yeah, let me just point out that Escape from [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=454.02000000000004s)]
*  Alcatraz was playing on television where Trump was this weekend, and it's clearly what happened is [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=460.42s)]
*  this guy saw Escape from Alcatraz and then grabbed his phone and started tweeting, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=465.46s)]
*  we ought to reopen Alcatraz. I mean, next time we're having a big issue with Ukraine, we should show [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=469.78s)]
*  Red Dawn with the Russians invading Colorado, and he'll probably give the Ukrainian nuclear weapons. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=476.09999999999997s)]
*  He treats the Constitution as sort of like a course that he's taken, and he can just skip [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=485.38s)]
*  certain classes and it doesn't matter. This is just nutty, and it's very, very dangerous. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=491.46s)]
*  And you know what really breaks my heart as a guy who helped elect a lot of these people who are up [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=499.29999999999995s)]
*  there? Why is it that no Republican senators are speaking out for the Constitution? If there was [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=503.62s)]
*  one conservative idea, it was to protect the Constitution and to try to follow the Constitution, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=510.9s)]
*  and that has just been thrown out the window. The Republican Party has become this sort of radical [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=518.9s)]
*  movement that has no coherent governing philosophy, and this is where you end up. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=524.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, what Donna, he promised was mass deportations, right? And that hasn't happened. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=531.06s)]
*  We did see, for example, 1,100 people picked up in Florida as part of an operation [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=535.38s)]
*  at the end of April, but this has not been the kind of nationwide headlines that I think the White [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=539.9399999999999s)]
*  House suggested that there might be. Is that why we're hearing all this tough talk, put them in [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=546.18s)]
*  Alcatraz, sort of in lieu of results? Well, I mean, I think, you know, everybody knows that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=550.7399999999999s)]
*  this proposal, or at least people who are sane know that the proposal to gather up so-called [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=558.7399999999999s)]
*  illegal immigrants and deport them was always a harebrained scheme. And so now he has to invent [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=565.4599999999999s)]
*  another reason to be. Now, I'm the law and order president when he doesn't have anything else [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=572.5s)]
*  to show for it. Unfortunately, American citizens, people who are here [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=579.06s)]
*  legally, people who are not gang members, are being swept up in Mr. Trump's craziness. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4owncaupveI&t=584.26s)]
