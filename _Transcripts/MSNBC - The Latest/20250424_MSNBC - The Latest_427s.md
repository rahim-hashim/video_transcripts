# 'They are making the pay to play deal explicit': Trump offers dinner to his meme coin investors
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc)
*  I will not say this, but we'll give Trump credit. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=0.0s)]
*  The big grift has reached unprecedented heights in what the New York Times describes as an [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=2.12s)]
*  astonishing escalation of the Trump family's efforts to profit from crypto. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=7.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is offering exclusive access to those willing to pay up and buy into his [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=13.16s)]
*  meme coin. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=17.92s)]
*  Trump offered the top 220 investors in the coin a seat at the private dinner at his golf [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  club in Virginia. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=25.36s)]
*  The coin is a business entity linked to Trump who owns a large tranche of the coins, meaning [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=27.18s)]
*  the president personally profits every time the price or value increases, at least on [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=33.42s)]
*  paper. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=38.94s)]
*  Trump and his business partners also collect fees when the coins are traded, a windfall [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=39.94s)]
*  that amounted to nearly $100 million in the weeks after the coin debuted in January. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=44.3s)]
*  Now in news of the dinner invitation spread on social media, the meme coin's price surged [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=50.66s)]
*  more than 70 percent. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=55.54s)]
*  Corey Frayer, who oversaw crypto policy for the SEC during the Biden years, said this, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=57.3s)]
*  quote, This is really incredible. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=62.86s)]
*  They are making the pay to play deal explicit. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=65.54s)]
*  Joining us now, technology reporter for the New York Times, David Yaffe Bellany, who is [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=68.86s)]
*  byline on that reporting we read from. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=72.98s)]
*  David Gurra is here as well. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=74.78s)]
*  Just for the out of the loop and uninformed, just take me through how this works for anyone [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=78.02s)]
*  and then we'll deal with how it works for an American president, if you don't mind. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=88.02s)]
*  So a meme coin is a pretty controversial type of cryptocurrency. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=93.86s)]
*  It doesn't have any real function beyond speculation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=97.7s)]
*  It's based on an online joke or a celebrity mascot. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=101.02s)]
*  And meme coins get launched every day, hundreds of them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=104.94s)]
*  It's very easy to do. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=107.28s)]
*  You can do it in a few clicks. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=108.28s)]
*  And just a few days before the inauguration, Trump launched one of his own. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=110.2s)]
*  So David, tell me what the reporting adds to our understanding of what Trump did before [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=115.44s)]
*  inauguration. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=121.68s)]
*  How is he sort of turning up the volume on the grift? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=122.68s)]
*  So when when the meme coin was initially launched, this raised a lot of concerns with ethics [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=127.68s)]
*  because clearly this presents a new avenue for people to channel money into the president's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=132.44s)]
*  pockets and potentially try to maneuver for access to the White House through that avenue. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=138.0s)]
*  But all of this was kind of implicit in the proposal. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=143.44s)]
*  What this news about the dinner does is make that completely explicit. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=147.08s)]
*  If you're in the top 220 investors in this meme coin, then you get access to the president. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=151.46s)]
*  You get to sit with him at a dinner and go on a VIP tour of the website. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=156.68s)]
*  And so it's sort of saying the quiet part out loud. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=161.48s)]
*  So this is what Richard Painter said on the SEC punting on any kind of oversight. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=164.5s)]
*  And he was the ethics adviser when I worked in the White House. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=170.12s)]
*  He said, quote, This is, I guess, going to be the new approach. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  Hands off crypto, not enforcing fraud. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=176.04s)]
*  And I don't think it's going to end well. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=178.56s)]
*  That's Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, an ethics lawyer [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=180.12s)]
*  for the George W. Bush administration. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=183.88s)]
*  Quote, the SEC is going to back off because that's what the Trump administration wants [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=185.92s)]
*  or whatever enforcement they're able to do. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=190.28s)]
*  I think it's a very worrisome situation. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=192.12s)]
*  What stops every elected official, Republican and Democratic, from doing this? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=194.88s)]
*  I mean, the fear is there really isn't anything to stop them. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  Under under Biden, the SEC was incredibly aggressive in policing crypto. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=205.16s)]
*  But that's that stopped. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=210.0s)]
*  And so it's sort of hard to believe that the SEC in this current administration is going [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=211.4s)]
*  to go after these cases with any aggression. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=215.36s)]
*  And in fact, the SEC has already declared that this specific type of cryptocurrency, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  the meme coin, is outside of its purview. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=222.11999999999998s)]
*  I mean, David Gura, this is so antithetical to the public trust, to the separation of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=225.6s)]
*  profiting off of your post in public service, off the American presidency. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=233.64s)]
*  And this is for us, our third story. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=239.92s)]
*  I haven't seen this get a lot of attention. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=242.48s)]
*  What's your sense of why that's the case? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  We started off the show talking about blinking and here it's winking. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=248.04s)]
*  If you look at the fine print on this website, I mean, it's wild to pick up on what David [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=251.32s)]
*  was saying just a moment ago. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=255.76s)]
*  They're very explicit that we shouldn't think of these as a currency or an investable [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=257.88s)]
*  stock like object. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=262.24s)]
*  We think of them as kind of a memento to show our affection for the president. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=263.4s)]
*  That's how they're characterized. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=267.96s)]
*  It's kind of a collectible. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=268.64s)]
*  But what was wise to me is if you look at sort of what they're offering here, it's to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=271.36s)]
*  go to the golf club, have dinner and then quote, hear firsthand President Trump talk [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=274.68s)]
*  about the future of crypto. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=279.08s)]
*  And that's another layer to the bizarreness of this, which, you know, for the first term, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=280.79999999999995s)]
*  he was such a crypto skeptic. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  This was not something that he believed in. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=286.2s)]
*  He cast doubt on it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=287.47999999999996s)]
*  He espoused his love for the dollar above above all else. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=288.35999999999996s)]
*  And now he's done a complete reversal because of the fact that he's figured out he can [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  make money off of this with pretty seeming ease. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=296.28s)]
*  So what would he say about the future of crypto? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  I have no idea other than the fact that it seems to be working out pretty well for him [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=302.24s)]
*  and for Eric Trump, who's running this part of the business, and for Baron Trump, who's [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=304.88s)]
*  also working for a crypto business that the Trumps have going as well. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=309.0s)]
*  So it's a very effective mechanism for them to make money. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  And as your colleague, Stephanie Rule, has pointed out, this is really the first time [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=315.2s)]
*  that Donald Trump has been like a bona fide, legitimate billionaire. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  He's made a ton of money off of this. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=322.2s)]
*  And you can look back on his past career and there was money in real estate and all of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=324.52s)]
*  that was so highly levered. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=327.32s)]
*  He, for the first time, is amassing a huge sum of wealth because of the dabbling that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=328.76s)]
*  he's doing in this space. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=333.0s)]
*  And if I mean, I'm just thinking of all of the things that Republicans investigated [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=334.36s)]
*  the Bidens for for mixing government service and business. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=339.56s)]
*  I mean, where is where is Congress? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=344.32s)]
*  Where is oversight? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=347.6s)]
*  Where are the ethics advisors? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=348.64s)]
*  I mean, it's been a longstanding story that Congress, despite some happy talk from some [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=350.2s)]
*  members, hasn't done much when it comes to cryptocurrency. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  So much faith was placed in the SEC during President Biden's term. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  That's now gone out the window. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  There is a new SEC chairman, Paul Atkins, is in that job. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=362.88s)]
*  And we've had this interim chair who relaxed the rules that David was talking about a [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=365.12s)]
*  moment ago. But this is part of the broader story of the hollowing out of the regulatory [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=368.12s)]
*  apparatus in Washington. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  And Congress will still talk about creating some tailored legislation for stable coins or [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=374.0s)]
*  some other niche cryptocurrency. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=378.92s)]
*  But there's nothing broad coming. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=380.84000000000003s)]
*  And it's a president who's acting with a lot of impunity, legal and otherwise, I think [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=382.44s)]
*  recognizing the fact that there are fewer cops on the beat and the likelihood of being [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=387.64s)]
*  caught for doing anything untoward or illegal is much smaller than, of course, as the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  Supreme Court decided, there's just kind of blanket immunity to the S as well. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=395.76s)]
*  It just leaves us where every other story does with a political reaction and whether or [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  not the country really wants this. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPeNO-lUqc&t=404.88s)]
