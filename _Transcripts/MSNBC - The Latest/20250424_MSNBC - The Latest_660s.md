# 'Reality bites Donald Trump in the you know where': China contradicts the White House over tariffs
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg)
*  Today, reality bites Donald Trump in the you-know-where. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=0.0s)]
*  If the price of eggs propelled Donald Trump to victory in November, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=4.0s)]
*  then his man-made economic instability, which has rattled markets [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=8.0s)]
*  and ushered in unease for American consumers, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=12.0s)]
*  may very well be his political undoing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=15.0s)]
*  A wave of new polls show that both Donald Trump's approval ratings [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=18.0s)]
*  and voters' opinions of his handling of the economy are today in freefall. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=21.0s)]
*  The New York Times average of polls shows this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=27.0s)]
*  Quote, Trump's approval rating has sunk to about 45 percent. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=29.0s)]
*  That's down from 52 percent one week after he took office. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=33.0s)]
*  Voters' views of his handling of the economy are even lower [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=36.0s)]
*  than his overall approval rating. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=40.0s)]
*  A Fox News poll out last night puts his approval on the economy at 38 percent. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=42.0s)]
*  As far as handling of inflation and tariffs, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=48.0s)]
*  just 33 percent of Americans approve of that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=51.0s)]
*  And for the first time since the year 2001, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=54.0s)]
*  a majority of Americans say their personal finances are getting worse. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=57.0s)]
*  So, see, it turns out the more voters see of Donald Trump's man-made chaos, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=62.0s)]
*  the less they like it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=67.0s)]
*  And there is a lot of chaos. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=68.0s)]
*  As the New York Times reports on major economic decisions, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=70.0s)]
*  Trump blinks and then blinks again. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=74.0s)]
*  As we reported on the show yesterday, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=76.0s)]
*  Donald Trump threatened to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=78.0s)]
*  then changed his mind and backed off that threat. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=82.0s)]
*  After slapping so-called reciprocal tariffs on every country [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=85.0s)]
*  and every island in the world, even those inhabited only by penguins, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=88.0s)]
*  he reversed himself on that and announced a pause on those, too. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=92.0s)]
*  As for China, which is subject to a 145 percent tariff, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=96.0s)]
*  Trump says, wow, now they're negotiating. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=100.0s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=103.0s)]
*  We are going to have a fair deal with China. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=104.0s)]
*  It's going to be fair. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=108.0s)]
*  Are you talking to them actively now? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=109.0s)]
*  Actively. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=111.0s)]
*  Everything's active. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=112.0s)]
*  Everybody wants to be a part of what we're doing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=113.0s)]
*  The Chinese government says no, not active. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=116.0s)]
*  Quote, China and the U.S. have not engaged in any consultations [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=120.0s)]
*  or negotiations regarding tariffs, let alone reached an agreement, end quote. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=123.0s)]
*  Adding that while China is open to talks, quote, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=128.0s)]
*  if it's a fight, we will fight till the end. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=131.0s)]
*  Confronted with China pouring cold water on Donald Trump's version of reality, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=134.0s)]
*  Trump said this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=139.0s)]
*  A question on China. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=140.0s)]
*  Can you clarify with whom the U.S. is speaking with China? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=142.0s)]
*  They're saying it's big news that trade talks are happening. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=145.0s)]
*  Well, they had a meeting this morning, so I can't tell you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=148.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter who they is. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=152.0s)]
*  They just doesn't include China in the U.S., according to China. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=153.0s)]
*  New York Times reports this, quote, in private, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=159.0s)]
*  some Trump officials concede that they did not accurately predict China's reaction. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=161.0s)]
*  Trump seemed to expect China to be among the first to come begging for relief, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=166.0s)]
*  given the size of its exports to the U.S. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=170.0s)]
*  Now, though, the cost of all of it, the price we as Americans and as a country [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=173.0s)]
*  are paying for Trump's incompetence and delusions as he stumbles on what was once [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=178.0s)]
*  his political calling card, the economy, is in part our image, our reputation, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=183.0s)]
*  our history, is a safe place to invest in and a reliable player and partner [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=190.0s)]
*  on the world stage. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=194.0s)]
*  Take a look at the cover of The Economist. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=195.0s)]
*  Quote, only 1,361 days to go, showing America's national symbol, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=198.0s)]
*  the bald eagle, battered and injured and bandaged. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=203.0s)]
*  The top Trump MAGA donor puts it this way, our national brand is at risk. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=208.0s)]
*  Take a listen to that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=213.0s)]
*  America rose beyond just being a country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=214.0s)]
*  It was like an aspiration for most of the world. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=216.0s)]
*  And we're eroding that brand right now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=219.0s)]
*  And if you think of your behavior as a consumer, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=224.0s)]
*  how many times do you buy a product with a brand on it because you trust that brand? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=227.0s)]
*  In the financial markets, no brand compared to the brand of the U.S. Treasuries. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=231.0s)]
*  U.S. Treasury market, the strength of the U.S. dollar and the strength, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=236.0s)]
*  the credit worthiness of U.S. Treasuries. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=239.0s)]
*  No brand came close. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=242.0s)]
*  We put that brand at risk. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=244.0s)]
*  And as you and I both know, it can take a very long time, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=248.0s)]
*  very long time to remove the tarnish on a brand. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=254.0s)]
*  So the president and the secretary of treasury and the secretary of commerce [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=258.0s)]
*  need to be very thoughtful that when you have a brand, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=262.0s)]
*  you need to behave in a way that respects that brand, that strengthens that brand. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=267.0s)]
*  Because when you tarnish that brand, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=271.0s)]
*  it can be a lifetime to repair the damage that has been done. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=274.0s)]
*  The economic and political price of Donald Trump's stumbles on the economy [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=278.0s)]
*  is where we start today. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=282.0s)]
*  Joining us now, U.S. financial commentator for the Financial Times, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=284.0s)]
*  writer of the Unhedge newsletter, Robert Armstrong is here. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=287.0s)]
*  Also joining us, Sarah Longwell. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=291.0s)]
*  She's publisher of The Bulwark, host of the podcast, The Focus Group. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=293.0s)]
*  And with me at the table for the hour, anchor and correspondent for Bloomberg News, David Gura. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=296.0s)]
*  Sarah Longwell, let me start with you and the public's experience [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=301.0s)]
*  of Donald Trump's erratic behavior around economic policy. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=306.0s)]
*  What has sunk in? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=311.0s)]
*  I mean, the main thing that has sunk in is that maybe Donald Trump [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=314.0s)]
*  doesn't know exactly what he's doing. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=317.0s)]
*  Look, the fact is, when it comes to why a lot of voters, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=320.0s)]
*  not all of them, not, you know, the hardcore MAGA people, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=324.0s)]
*  but there was another major slice of the Trump voting coalition [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=326.0s)]
*  that were people who just wanted things to cost less, right? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=330.0s)]
*  They were upset about inflation. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=333.0s)]
*  They were upset about the cost of housing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=335.0s)]
*  And they heard Donald Trump promise to lower the price of groceries [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=337.0s)]
*  and that he was going to lower the cost of everything. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=342.0s)]
*  It was going to be so easy and so fast. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=345.0s)]
*  And when you listen to voters and focus groups, they say, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=347.0s)]
*  not only are things not getting better, but it feels like they're getting worse. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=350.0s)]
*  And the level of uncertainty that they feel, and that is it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=354.0s)]
*  I really want to, it's the uncertainty that you can hear from people. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=358.0s)]
*  You know, you'll get some who are, you know, they're still fans of Donald Trump, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=361.0s)]
*  but they're kind of like, boy, I hope this works out. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=364.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=367.0s)]
*  But then you get other people, especially people who are cost constrained, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=368.0s)]
*  who are at the lower end of the income spectrum. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=371.0s)]
*  And those people notice every dollar and the way any price that goes up. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=374.0s)]
*  And so from those voters who heard the promise that Trump was going to lower costs, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=378.0s)]
*  who thought he was a businessman who knew what he was doing, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=382.0s)]
*  and is now watching this chaos and not seeing their prices go down, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=385.0s)]
*  they are starting to lose faith that he's going to be able to keep the promises that he made to them. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=389.0s)]
*  Sarah, you and I had a lot of conversations in the run up to the November election day [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=394.0s)]
*  talking about how, you know, who could break through to people? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=401.0s)]
*  You know, could generals make the argument? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=404.0s)]
*  And they finally, in the closing days of the campaign, spoke out about who Trump was. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=406.0s)]
*  They said he was, quote, fascist to the core. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=410.0s)]
*  I think that no one would have ever been cynical enough to want people to experience [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=413.0s)]
*  any economic insecurity, instability, or rising prices, right? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=422.0s)]
*  It's not a thought exercise because too many people's lives and livelihoods [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=427.0s)]
*  and sense of their place in the world is at risk. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=432.0s)]
*  But Donald Trump has done that experience for us. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=435.0s)]
*  And I think if we go into the numbers, he's never had a 33% approval on any economic question. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=438.0s)]
*  I don't think he even had that during the pandemic when the disapproval was for supply chain issues, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=444.0s)]
*  which people didn't completely blame him for. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=450.0s)]
*  The world was shut down. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=452.0s)]
*  The world's streets were empty. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=454.0s)]
*  And 38% is his overall approval on the economy. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=456.0s)]
*  Has he ever been here before politically? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=459.0s)]
*  He's never been here before. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=462.0s)]
*  But part of the reason he's never been here before is that with the exception of COVID, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=464.0s)]
*  where people recognized a major exogenous event occurring, Donald Trump's strength, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=468.0s)]
*  his central mythology was this idea that he was a businessman. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=473.0s)]
*  And in that first term before COVID hit, he had a very strong economy and he kept running it hot. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=476.0s)]
*  And so what you're seeing right now is people experiencing negative personal consequences [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=483.0s)]
*  as the result of the decisions that Donald Trump is making. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=488.0s)]
*  And so when Donald Trump's strength, the thing that people count on him the most for, there's two things. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=492.0s)]
*  One, that he will handle immigration well, and two, that he will handle the economy well, although they're flipped. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=497.0s)]
*  They want the economy first, immigration second. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=502.0s)]
*  And right now, he is failing on both of those fronts, and you're seeing his numbers drop on both of those fronts. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=504.0s)]
*  And when you go at his strengths, at the central things people elected him to do, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=510.0s)]
*  and people feel like he's failing on those fronts, especially because he keeps deporting people wrongly [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=515.0s)]
*  and he keeps crashing the stock market and prices of things are going up, inflation's not coming down, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=520.0s)]
*  he made promises he couldn't keep. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=525.0s)]
*  That is a recipe for Donald Trump to get into really negative territory really fast. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=527.0s)]
*  We have never seen somebody in the first hundred days. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=532.0s)]
*  I mean, presidents enjoy a hunger period. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=534.0s)]
*  The bottom usually starts to fall out sometime in the summer. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=537.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has managed to crater every advantage he had before the first hundred days are up. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=539.0s)]
*  We talk a lot as well about message delivery in the Manosphere and the Blogosphere and the Potosphere [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=545.0s)]
*  and the Spherosphere and all that stuff, message delivery. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=551.0s)]
*  It feels like we're in a lived experience chapter of our politics. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=555.0s)]
*  How much influence do influencers even have in the political arena right now, Sarah? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=560.0s)]
*  Well, they actually do have some. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=565.0s)]
*  Look, I want to make an argument for offense right now. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=567.0s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump wanted to make the case that the problems in the economy were Joe Biden's fault. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=571.0s)]
*  And I think that, yes, people do not believe that, and they don't believe it in part because [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=577.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has made it such a signature, the tariffs especially, such a signature of what he's doing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=581.0s)]
*  But look, you've got to be able to press your advantage. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=587.0s)]
*  You've got to go on offense. You've got to say Trump is doing this. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=589.0s)]
*  And I think people have been doing a better job of making him own this. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=592.0s)]
*  And then especially where this has mattered is on immigration. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=596.0s)]
*  You know, I think there were some politicians who said, look, don't talk about these wrongful deportations [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=599.0s)]
*  because, you know, Trump is so strong on immigration and it'll just be a distraction. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=605.0s)]
*  That is wrong. Okay. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=610.0s)]
*  Pressing on this, pressing on the rule of law components on this and the fact that he's defying the Supreme Court, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=612.0s)]
*  that has mattered. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=618.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's numbers are falling precipitously on his handling of immigration. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=619.0s)]
*  And so I think people need to start realizing that you can, people are so afraid of Trump. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=623.0s)]
*  Don't be afraid of Donald Trump. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=627.0s)]
*  Go on offense. Help the American people understand why this is happening and whose fault it is. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=629.0s)]
*  And I think you will continue to see Donald Trump's numbers decline because he is making so many catastrophically bad decisions. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=634.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAGVnjviPg&t=657.0s)]
