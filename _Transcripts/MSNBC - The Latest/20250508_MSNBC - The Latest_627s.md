Video Description: President Trump is expected to announce a trade deal with the United Kingdom, the first such deal with a country hit by global tariffs by the U.S. government in April. University of Michigan Economics and Public Policy professor Justin Wolfers, Axios Chief Economic Correspondent Neil Irwin, and NBC News’ Brian Cheung and Vaughn Hillyard join Ana Cabrera to preview what the deal may look like and if it will move the needle on recession fears.

# U.S., UK trade deal likely ‘tiny little peas’, not even ‘small potatoes’: Economics professor
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM)
*  Yeah, right now, Brian, the details are lacking, but the president did make this announcement [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=0.0s)]
*  on social media calling it a full and comprehensive deal, one that's going to cement the relationship [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=5.2s)]
*  between these two countries for many years to come. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  Any reactions so far from the markets and from the business community? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=12.38s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, it seems like the announcement that, you know, there will be some sort of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=14.92s)]
*  announcement has markets excited. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=18.36s)]
*  Currently, the markets are up. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=19.88s)]
*  When you look at the S&P 500 up about half a percent. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=21.44s)]
*  The Dow Jones Industrial Average up about the same. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  You can see over 230 points in the first 30 minutes of trading here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=26.28s)]
*  But again, I think a lot of the market movements and just the general business community reaction, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=29.72s)]
*  this is going to depend on the details of this agreement. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=34.4s)]
*  Yes, the president is saying on social that this is a full and comprehensive deal. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=36.76s)]
*  Is it going to be a full and comprehensive deal? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=41.0s)]
*  I think that given the speed and just also the nature of the trading relationship that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=42.8s)]
*  we have right now, as Vaughn just interestingly pointed out, which is true, that the United [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  States has a trade surplus with the UK as well. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=50.14s)]
*  And also understanding that the United Kingdom isn't necessarily one of the largest trading [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=52.8s)]
*  partners with the United States, at least by volume and by dollar amount. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, yes, maybe this is just at least the first step. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  But at least it seems like in the early trading that markets are at least a little bit optimistic [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=62.16s)]
*  that this could maybe be the first domino to fall in what could be these other trade [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=66.44s)]
*  deals, even if not as aggressively fast as the administration had promised with the 90 [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=69.52s)]
*  deals in 90 days. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=73.88s)]
*  We don't know how big of a deal this really is at this point. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  And Justin, it would be just one deal with one country after the White House has boasted [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=78.24s)]
*  they will sign dozens of deals by July. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=83.44s)]
*  How do you see it? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, actually, we do know how much of a deal this is or could be because we know a lot [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=87.24s)]
*  about our trading relationship with Britain. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=91.44s)]
*  It's our 11th closest trading partner. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=94.08s)]
*  It is responsible for 3% of total trade from the United States. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=98.88s)]
*  And more than that, we can go a step further. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  Before all this began, we know the average tariff rate that the United Kingdom charged [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=109.44s)]
*  its trading partners was 1%. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=114.76s)]
*  So that's the best you can do is move that from one to zero. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=119.12s)]
*  And I don't reckon he's done that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=123.4s)]
*  So there's a chance I reckon maybe he's got now average tariff rate. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=124.84s)]
*  I'm just guessing because we haven't seen the agreement down from 1% to 0.8% from a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=128.28s)]
*  trading partner that's worth 3% of our trade. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  So if this sounds like small potatoes to you, that's because these aren't potatoes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  These are tiny little peas. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=141.0s)]
*  So, Neil, let me just reiterate what we have now heard from our guests and analysts here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=142.56s)]
*  Already, the UK buys more from the US than it sells to America. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=148.52s)]
*  So the US has a trade surplus with Britain that figures rising. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  Why was the UK included in the broad tariffs to begin with? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=158.56s)]
*  And how might today's announcement perhaps set the stage for other potential deals to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=161.8s)]
*  come? Yeah, look, the key of today's news and the reason markets are up is because it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=166.08s)]
*  does show that there are off ramps from this trade war that can deescalate on a country [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=170.4s)]
*  by country basis. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=174.96s)]
*  On the other hand, as the other guests are saying, this was the low hanging fruit. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=177.24s)]
*  This was the easiest one because of the surplus, because of the size and scale, even the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=180.28s)]
*  historical relationship, the kind of special relationship between the US and Britain. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=184.0s)]
*  Look, the big ones are yet to come. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=188.36s)]
*  You know, we're going to have this weekend talks between Secretary Besson and the Chinese [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=189.56s)]
*  in Geneva. That's a much more consequential for the economy, for the world trading system. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=193.68s)]
*  What becomes of that? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=199.28s)]
*  These hundred and forty five percent tariffs on China, are those going to be deescalated [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  anytime soon or is that something that we're dealing with for weeks and months? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  That matters economically a whole lot more than anything that gets done with the UK. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=207.28s)]
*  Neil, do you think this gives Secretary Besson any more leverage heading into those talks [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=210.88s)]
*  with China this weekend? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure about this, about that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=217.16s)]
*  You know, the the other thing we don't know about the UK deal is is this 10 percent tariff? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=218.72s)]
*  It's kind of the across the board minimum. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=222.68s)]
*  Is that going to remain in place on Britain? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=224.28s)]
*  You know, if that's the case, that's a signal that even countries that do things right, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=226.0s)]
*  that have a trade deficit with the US, that that are kind of good partners are still going [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=229.4s)]
*  to face these these significant levies, which is a lot higher than we had this time six [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=234.0s)]
*  months ago. So so, you know, I'm not sure that a deal with the UK changes the equation [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=237.76s)]
*  with China. And again, the economics, the size, the scale of those hundred and forty [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=241.76s)]
*  five percent tariffs on Chinese imports, just a different order of magnitude than what we're [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=246.32s)]
*  talking about here today. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=249.8s)]
*  And Vaughn, wouldn't this all have to be approved by Congress? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=251.16s)]
*  How long could that take? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=254.08s)]
*  Right. I don't want to sidestep your question on it, but I think that's a serious [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=255.56s)]
*  question here is the extent to what the details are of this trade agreement. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=259.32s)]
*  Right. The president is contended in to a certain extent that he has the executive [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=263.79999999999995s)]
*  authority to negotiate foreign policy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=269.2s)]
*  At the same time, the Constitution is clear that foreign commerce falls under the purview [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=272.67999999999995s)]
*  of Congress and that it has been a longstanding policy that Congress approves trade [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  deals, much like they did the USMCA trade agreement. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  But even if you go back to right just before President Obama left office, he was [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=286.36s)]
*  negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership and there was much rancor even within his [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=290.88s)]
*  own party over fast track authority just to give the president the negotiating power [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  to be the one negotiating directly with the more than dozen other countries as part of [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  the TPP. And that wasn't even a discussion ultimately on whether TPP [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=305.84s)]
*  would be approved by Congress or not. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=312.56s)]
*  And so what you're seeing in this situation is that Congress has effectively ceded [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=314.24s)]
*  negotiating power to the president of the United States. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=318.56s)]
*  And based off of the details here, I think that will be a conversation up on Capitol [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=321.68s)]
*  Hill, the extent to which any sort of trade deal here that is to be announced in the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=325.84s)]
*  next hour ultimately needs congressional approval or not. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=330.96s)]
*  And as we await this announcement from the Oval Office, just an UK deal or not, Trump's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=334.16s)]
*  tariffs have already sent shockwaves through the auto industry. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=339.52s)]
*  In just the last 24 hours, Ford announced its raising prices on several models. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=343.12s)]
*  The world's biggest automaker, Toyota, says tariffs are going to instantly wipe out [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  over a billion dollars in profits. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=352.88s)]
*  Does any of this translate to better outcomes for the US auto industry, which is [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=355.35999999999996s)]
*  one of the stated goals? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=360.64s)]
*  Well, I can start with my own personal finances here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=363.35999999999996s)]
*  I've been needing to buy a second car for quite a while and seeing these tariffs come [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=366.32s)]
*  in, I don't want to pay 25 percent over the odds. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=371.0s)]
*  And I think there's some chance at some point this administration is going to back down. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=373.48s)]
*  So I've stayed out of that market. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=377.48s)]
*  I'm not advising your viewers to do the same. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=379.44s)]
*  But what that means is there's a whole lot less demand for US autos right now. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=381.52s)]
*  Second thing to realize is this whole mess has put the US on the cusp of a recession. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=386.28s)]
*  The first thing that goes south when we go into recession is people stop buying those [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=392.24s)]
*  big, durable goods like cars. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=396.28s)]
*  And so potentially the president has put us right in the crosshairs of a real downturn [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=398.91999999999996s)]
*  that could really hurt the auto industry and my home state here of Michigan. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=404.79999999999995s)]
*  And in fact, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, warned yesterday that the risk of stagflation [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=409.11999999999995s)]
*  is higher now this morning. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=414.64s)]
*  President Trump's calling Jerome Powell a fool. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=416.59999999999997s)]
*  Brian, will this one deal alleviate potential stagflation concerns at all? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=419.64s)]
*  Not this singular deal. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=425.48s)]
*  But again, I think it's all about the momentum in totality with whether or not there are [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=426.68s)]
*  other trade deals to follow, because in the aggregate, yes, a number of countries signing [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=430.2s)]
*  trade deals with the United States, especially if you talk about China entering in the fold. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=434.8s)]
*  But yes, that would be impactful for the tariff uncertainty that the Fed chair spoke about [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=438.84s)]
*  yesterday when the Fed decided not to move on interest rates, obviously drawing the ire [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=443.04s)]
*  of the president, who has been very vocal in calling on the Fed chair his own appointee. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=446.76s)]
*  I should remind our viewers to lower interest rates, which he didn't yesterday. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=450.84s)]
*  The key word in the meeting yesterday with regards to the overall economic outlook was [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=454.52s)]
*  wait and see. That's what the Fed wants to do here. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=459.04s)]
*  Yes, they could lower interest rates later on if the economy needs it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=460.76s)]
*  Right now, they see the economy as in good enough footing with unemployment relatively low, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=464.64s)]
*  four point two percent inflation, a little bit above their target, but still nonetheless [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=468.44s)]
*  not necessarily exacerbated at this moment. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=473.12s)]
*  But again, this is all about the tariff uncertainty. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=475.4s)]
*  The Fed actually, interestingly, still is holding on to this view that the tariffs could [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=478.0s)]
*  not to bring that word up again, but transitory if it's the case that a number of countries can [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=482.32s)]
*  sign a deal very quickly. But if they last for, let's say, six months or maybe a year, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=487.11999999999995s)]
*  does that then bleed into something that could have a permanent impact or at least a medium [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=491.28s)]
*  term impact on inflation? That's what the Federal Reserve is unsure about. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=495.44s)]
*  How do they predict what's going on out in the White House? This is the first domino to fall. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  That's certainly encouraging. But does that point to momentum going forward? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=502.0s)]
*  That's what the Fed wants. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  And already we know that shipments to the ports like in Los Angeles are down right now. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=505.91999999999996s)]
*  Therefore, even if there is a deal across the board over multiple countries to get the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=510.56s)]
*  product moving again, still going to take some time. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=516.8000000000001s)]
*  Neil, there's been this heated debate in just the past day or so about [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=519.84s)]
*  the longer term view on the U.S. economy. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=524.4s)]
*  And I want you to listen to the two sides here from Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=526.72s)]
*  as well as Trump's economic counsel director, Kevin Hassett, speaking about this last night. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=530.96s)]
*  What economists, not politicians, economists are out there debating is, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=536.0s)]
*  are we already in the recession? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=541.44s)]
*  Right. That's it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=543.12s)]
*  Or are we just headed over the cliff into the recession? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=544.08s)]
*  I'm dismayed that they've got bad economic modeling of what might happen to tariffs. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=547.36s)]
*  They said, you know, if you look at the Wall Street folks, they're saying that the tariffs [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=552.4s)]
*  are going to crater the economy. Meanwhile, we got really strong jobs [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=555.36s)]
*  and we don't have the inflation that they said was going to happen. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=559.12s)]
*  Neil, who's right? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=563.04s)]
*  Look, these big economic changes don't happen overnight. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=565.92s)]
*  We've seen this with past episodes. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=569.28s)]
*  The stock market bubble of the dot com era peaked in March 2000. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=571.28s)]
*  There wasn't a recession until March 2001. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=574.96s)]
*  The global financial crisis started in the summer of 2007. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=577.12s)]
*  There wasn't a recession until early 2008. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=579.84s)]
*  You can't expect for these changes that do have massive economic consequences [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=582.08s)]
*  to show up in all the data, in employment, in the unemployment rate, in GDP. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=585.6s)]
*  It just doesn't show up overnight. These things move more slowly. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=589.6s)]
*  Whether Senator Warren is right or not that we're already in recession, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=592.4s)]
*  if there ends up being one, when does it exactly start? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=595.6s)]
*  We don't know the answer to that. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=597.68s)]
*  What we do know is that the fact that things have stabilized in markets [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=599.1999999999999s)]
*  does not necessarily mean we're out of the woods for what is to come. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6TkkAgkuFM&t=603.28s)]
