# Trump vanity parade comes with hefty price tag; will displace Vietnam veterans event
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg)
*  Two weeks from tomorrow, Donald Trump will finally get the military parade [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=0.0s)]
*  he's been pretty much begging for. Ever the fanboy for the pomp and the glitz of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=4.96s)]
*  a big show, whatever it looks like, Trump first became enamored with the idea in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  2017 after seeing France's military parade on Bastille Day. And even months [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=15.24s)]
*  after attending, he just couldn't get it out of his head. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=20.2s)]
*  It was one of the greatest parades I've ever seen. It was two hours on the button [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=24.88s)]
*  and it was military might. Because of what I witnessed, we may do something like [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=30.88s)]
*  that on July 4th in Washington down Pennsylvania. I don't know, we're going to have to try and top it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=35.6s)]
*  But we had a lot of planes going over, we had a lot of military might. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Now, Trump never got the military parade he envisioned during his first term. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Though after multiple delays, Trump did manage in 2019 to put on a July 4th salute to America. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=53.08s)]
*  But it lacked that something special he really, really wanted. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=59.08s)]
*  Like tanks rolling down the streets of Washington, D.C. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=63.08s)]
*  And all that was due to several factors, like big concerns over costs, the fact that the tanks [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=67.08s)]
*  weighing nearly 60 tons each would rip up D.C. roads, and the Pentagon's real alarm, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=71.08s)]
*  understandably, over the optics. I mean, Trump's first Secretary of Defense, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=77.08s)]
*  4-star General Jim Mattis reportedly said that he would, quote, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=81.08s)]
*  rather swallow acid than watch the military parade that Trump wanted. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=84.08s)]
*  It's quite a memorable quote. And the vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff reportedly told [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=89.08s)]
*  colleagues at the Pentagon that the parade that Trump wanted was what dictators do. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=93.08s)]
*  Well, that was then, and this is now. And now Donald Trump has an administration full of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=98.08s)]
*  yes men and yes women, including a former weekend cable host running the Pentagon. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=103.08s)]
*  And so Donald Trump will finally get the parade he's always dreamed of. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=109.08s)]
*  Now, to be clear, plans have been in the works for a while now to celebrate the 250th anniversary [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=112.08s)]
*  of the U.S. Army. But at some point this year, those plans changed to include the massive parade [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=117.08s)]
*  in D.C. on June 14th, which also happens to be Trump's 79th birthday. Go figure. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=123.08s)]
*  Now, preparations for that event are already underway, and it will reportedly include about [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  130 vehicles, including tanks, armored fighting vehicles, trucks, towing artillery launchers, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  50 helicopters and 9000 troops. Those troops will be housed in government buildings and will be [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=138.08s)]
*  sleeping on cots and in their own sleeping bags. According to NBC News, they will also be expected [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=144.08s)]
*  to dine on ready to eat rations during their stay here for this parade. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=149.08s)]
*  Imagine those accommodations have something to do with cost cutting. This is, of course, the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=154.08s)]
*  administration that likes to brag about its focus on cutting wasteful spending. And yet the whole [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=158.08s)]
*  thing is still expected to cost as much as $45 million. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=163.08s)]
*  I figure, by the way, that doesn't include paying to fix damaged roads, clean up, security, but [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=168.08s)]
*  that's actually not the only cost of Donald Trump's strongman vanity parade. See, for more than [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=173.08s)]
*  three decades, veterans of the Vietnam War and their families have held an annual ceremony at the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=178.08s)]
*  Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. to honor those who served and died. And this year, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=183.08s)]
*  for the first time, that ceremony is being forced to move out of D.C. to make room for Trump's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=189.08s)]
*  military parade. This year, the ceremony for Vietnam War vets will be held a few miles away in [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=194.08s)]
*  Virginia and feature a three-quarter scale reproduction of the iconic wall memorial. And while [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=200.08s)]
*  many who plan to attend still feel the gesture from the organizers of the ceremony is genuine and it [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=205.08s)]
*  certainly is, some also feel like it won't be the same. One veteran speaking with Stars and Stripes [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=210.08s)]
*  said, quote, visiting the wall at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is sacred. This is like putting [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=215.08s)]
*  up a model of the Statue of Liberty. A wife of a veteran told the Washington Post, I don't, I feel [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=220.08s)]
*  anger. I think I'm just, I don't feel anger. I think I'm just really sad. But I'm still going to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=225.08s)]
*  honor my husband. And another veteran's wife said, I respect the 250th anniversary of the Army. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=230.08s)]
*  That is not a small deal. But our heroes are being shoved aside. This is no way to honor the Army or [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=235.08s)]
*  our country. Amen to that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLQ36EiFbg&t=241.08s)]
