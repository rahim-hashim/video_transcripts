# 'Underwater', 'sinking', 'plunging': Trump's approval drops to historic low for first 100 days
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU)
*  Underwater, sinking, plunging. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=0.0s)]
*  These are not the terms you want to hear if you're a politician. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=3.24s)]
*  But that's how President Trump is described in polling as he enters his 100th day in office. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  A slate of recent surveys, including from NBC News, shows voters venting frustration. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=12.64s)]
*  The president's approval rating is hovering around 44 percent. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=18.36s)]
*  That's one of the lowest on record historically for a president at this point in any administration. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=21.96s)]
*  I guess the silver lining for Trump is that these are higher marks than at this point during his first term. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=27.36s)]
*  But when you dig into key issues that drove Trump to victory in November, like the economy and immigration, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=32.64s)]
*  you see serious warning signs for this administration. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=38.44s)]
*  And joining us now to discuss NBC News White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=42.04s)]
*  along with former senior adviser to the Harris-Waltz campaign and former Biden White House official Ian Sams [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=46.28s)]
*  and former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, Charlie Dent. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=52.44s)]
*  Yamiche, the backlash to Trump's tariffs has really resulted in some of the lowest numbers ever on the economy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=55.72s)]
*  The latest New York Times poll finds half of voters say he's made the economy worse already. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=62.0s)]
*  It's only been a few months. How's the White House responding? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=67.64s)]
*  Well, as you said, Ana, these are striking poll numbers and really are warning signs for President Trump, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=71.04s)]
*  with voters saying that they're not liking what they're seeing when it comes to the economy, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=76.0s)]
*  his tariff plans, as well as cuts being made to the government. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=79.72s)]
*  That being said, the president is reacting to this. It's clearly on his mind. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=84.12s)]
*  He, in an early morning post, said that these polls are fake polls from fake news organizations. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=87.8s)]
*  He also said these people should be investigated for election fraud. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=93.28s)]
*  And he said, add in Fox News pollster while you're at it, which is interesting because Fox News said [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=97.16s)]
*  President Trump broke his own record among recent presidents for the worst approval rating at the 100-day mark. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=101.68s)]
*  The president also said pollsters are, quote, truly the enemy of the people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  So it really is showing that President Trump is not just railing at the people that he usually rails at, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=111.16s)]
*  but also he's railing at Fox News and others who, of course, are still dealing with the science and data of polling. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=115.64s)]
*  It's sort of undeniable in this way. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  The president clearly showing that he's worried here, but also trying to attack pollsters as he's done in the past, Ana. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=123.8s)]
*  Yeah, Michelle Sandor, thanks for giving us a little pulse of the people there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=129.56s)]
*  Ian, again, the president seeing his lowest numbers on his top issue, the economy, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=133.68s)]
*  if this is how people are rating the economy before the expected price increases have hit the market, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=140.2s)]
*  how much longer can the White House ride this out before changing tactics? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=145.72s)]
*  Well, instead of lashing out, he'd be wise to listen. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=151.44s)]
*  I think that if you look back at the election last year, all of us who were part of it or anyone who was paying attention [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  knew that the number one issue on people's minds was the economy and the high prices that people were paying because of inflation. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=158.88s)]
*  And we're still in the middle of an affordability crisis where millions of people across this country can't afford the daily necessities. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=166.28s)]
*  And they don't see him focused on that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=172.96s)]
*  When President Biden won in 2020, everyone's top issue was COVID and fixing the pandemic. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=175.24s)]
*  And so every day for nine straight months, pretty much he made it very visible that he was working on the on COVID, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=180.52s)]
*  on fixing the pandemic and getting people vaccinated. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=187.12s)]
*  And it saw positive approval ratings for nine straight months, because when you were doing what you said you were going to do on the issue that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  matters most to people, you're going to see that reflected in the polls. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=195.64s)]
*  And so instead, we've seen Trump, you know, seeking more power, deporting people, doing anything but focused on prices and then injecting [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  these chaotic tariffs into the equation that are going to raise prices. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=207.04s)]
*  So he should be listening and reflecting on the fact that the country is turning against him instead of lashing out. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  I guess on one hand, Congressman Dent, on the big issues, President Trump is largely doing what candidate Trump said he was going to do. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=216.11999999999998s)]
*  An immigration crackdown, tariffs, pardons for January 6th attackers slashing the federal government. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=223.16s)]
*  Isn't this what people voted for? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=228.64s)]
*  Well, they certainly voted for the tariffs, but I don't think they voted for this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=231.8s)]
*  Here's the Allentown morning call, Mack trucks laying off people. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=235.28s)]
*  The plant officials are saying it's because of the tariffs. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=238.48s)]
*  But this is happening all over the country. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=241.48s)]
*  A lot of people did vote for the tariffs, but I don't think they necessarily understood what they were voting for. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=245.04s)]
*  It's a massive tax increase, and I think this is really driving his negative numbers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=251.0s)]
*  Plus, the way he executes his policy immigration, for example, he still viewed somewhat favorably there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=256.92s)]
*  And even on the DEI stuff, he's got some favorabilities there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=264.48s)]
*  But the way he executes his program turns off so many voters. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=267.64s)]
*  And if you look at these numbers to among independent voters, he is in real trouble there. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=272.4s)]
*  And so if you're a Republican and anything close to a competitive congressional district or state, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=277.56s)]
*  you need to pay attention to that number above all the others we've seen here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=282.56s)]
*  But Trump's own chaotic way of doing things is hurting him, and it's affecting people's pocketbooks in real time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=286.76s)]
*  Yeah, and I want to talk more about the tactics we've seen. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=293.28s)]
*  The president used to accomplish some of his goals. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  We've seen him go after private law firms and universities. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=298.12s)]
*  Now he's upset with the polling. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=301.96s)]
*  He's threatening media outlets who conducted these polls saying, quote, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=303.48s)]
*  these people should be investigated for election fraud. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=306.8s)]
*  How concerned are you that he's going to follow through on targeting anyone who doesn't bend to his will or promote the narrative he likes? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=309.68s)]
*  Well, he is going to target people who he disagrees with and who he perceives to be his enemies. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=318.76s)]
*  That's what he's always done. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=323.6s)]
*  And there's no reason to think he's going to change course now. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  I think that what the reality of the fact is, though, is that he's doing that because he sees his popularity slipping away. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=329.0s)]
*  And so I think as he sees his popularity slipping away, he's going to start worrying more and more about his standing with the country. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=336.28s)]
*  And he's going to see that he can't get away with all of these things that he's trying to get away with, because you can get away with it to a point if you're popular, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=343.36s)]
*  if you're doing things that people see as helping them in their daily lives. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=351.16s)]
*  That's not happening. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=355.08s)]
*  And so I think that as he lashes out, more and more voters are going to see that as a temper tantrum, frankly, from someone who's losing their popularity in the country. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=356.4s)]
*  And you're going to see the effects of that in elections this year in Virginia and New Jersey, in elections in the midterms next year. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=365.47999999999996s)]
*  You're going to start to see voters turning the page on this and choosing the alternative because they don't want to see someone who's clamping down on dissent, who's clamping down on our very values. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=370.91999999999996s)]
*  We're seeing the decline in his polling approval. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=382.52s)]
*  We're seeing protests now more and more in the streets for certain issues. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=385.52s)]
*  We're also seeing backlash at town halls. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=391.2s)]
*  We know that people have not been happy with the effects of Doge and Elon Musk, who is also very unpopular in the recent polling. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=394.24s)]
*  Here was New York Congressman Mike Lawler's latest town hall. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=403.24s)]
*  He appears to be the latest to contend with heckling over these these Doge cuts. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=407.76s)]
*  Watch this last night. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=412.76s)]
*  What specifically are you doing that warrants the label moderate? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=414.76s)]
*  So, again, my record speaks for itself. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=426.76s)]
*  I have been I have been rated the fourth most bipartisan for a reason. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=429.76s)]
*  Taxing the rich is not going to close our budget deficit. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=436.76s)]
*  I hope you realize that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=440.76s)]
*  It really will not. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=442.76s)]
*  Congressman Dent, he is one of these swing district candidates, a Republican who's in a purple district. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=446.76s)]
*  How do you think GOP lawmakers should approach this? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=453.76s)]
*  Well, certainly Mike Lawler is in a tough spot, as is every other Republican member in anything close to a swing district, as is the case of Mike Lawler. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=458.76s)]
*  But I see. But it's hard to defend the indefensible at times. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=466.76s)]
*  Take the income tax that Congress and Lawler just referred to. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=469.76s)]
*  President Trump just said that he's going to eliminate the income tax with tariff revenue. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=472.76s)]
*  Well, the income tax represents about half of all federal revenue, I think about two point four trillion dollars in twenty twenty four. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=477.76s)]
*  Well, and then the other hand, you've got Scott Bessent saying they're going to negotiate deals, meaning that they're going to lower tariffs. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=484.76s)]
*  So there is this utter incoherence in what the president is saying, making it extraordinarily difficult for Congress and like Mike Lawler and others to try to explain it because you really can't explain it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=491.76s)]
*  This is crazy. And it's hurting these Republican congressional candidates who will be up in twenty twenty six without a doubt. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=502.76s)]
*  Former Congressman Charlie Dent and Ian Sands. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=509.76s)]
*  Thank you, gentlemen, for the conversation. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=512.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvtkgKbggU&t=521.76s)]
