# Fmr. acting FAA chief: 'Air control system is safe,' but 'starting to see a little bit of cracks'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk)
*  A string of recent air traffic control incidents have travelers on edge. Just yesterday, the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=0.0s)]
*  FAA confirmed that pilots flying into the Denver airport lost contact with air traffic [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  control for almost two minutes. And pilots have experienced similar issues when landing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=13.72s)]
*  at Newark airport as well. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=19.56s)]
*  Sources tell NBC News that air traffic control in Newark has lost contact with pilots several [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=21.32s)]
*  times. On top of that, Newark air traffic control is facing a dire staffing crisis, and they're [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=26.84s)]
*  not the only ones. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=32.48s)]
*  A New York Times analysis shows that 99% of the air traffic control facilities in the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  U.S. are operating below recommended staffing levels. For more, I want to bring in a former [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=38.96s)]
*  acting FAA administrator. His name is Billy Nolan, and he joins us now. Mr. Nolan, how [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  can the FAA solve air traffic control staffing crisis? And when you have incidents like this [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  where they lose control with the planes, this seems to add another layer of difficulty and stress onto a job that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=54.2s)]
*  probably is one of the most stressful that anyone could have. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, well, Michelle, first, thank you for having me on tonight. You know, bottom line up front is that while our [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=65.44s)]
*  nation's airspace system is safe, our air traffic control system is safe, it's starting to show some signs [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=73.16s)]
*  there. You're starting to see a little bit of cracks. I don't recall during my time as acting FAA administrator that we [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=80.48s)]
*  sort of had outages around the system. There were some things that we were seeing. And so I really do commend [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  Secretary Duffy for a couple of things. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=95.28s)]
*  Number one, bringing the industry together. And for the first time, and I've been a pilot for 45 years, for the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  first time in my career, having this kind of just, you know, unanimous support around fixing and investing, you know, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=105.36s)]
*  investing is a much better word, our air transportation system. And to your point, giving the flying public that sense of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=114.0s)]
*  comfort that they need and that they deserve. That, number one, that the system is safe and number two, that the investments [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=121.8s)]
*  are there to make sure that it keeps pace as our nation airspace grows. We're operating 45 to 50,000 flights a day. We've got a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=129.28s)]
*  million drones operating in the NAS. We've got new entrants like EVTOLs, flying techs, whatever you want to call them, are all [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=139.6s)]
*  coming in. So really, this is a time for us to just stop and reflect on what we need to do to make sure that our system can [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=146.24s)]
*  keep pace. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=153.28s)]
*  Stop and reflect. And yet, you know, we are still seeing planes taking off from some of the larger airports at, you know, almost 30 [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=154.44s)]
*  second intervals. The Transportation Secretary, Secretary Duffy, just unveiled a plan to modernize air traffic systems. You [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=161.96s)]
*  yourself have called for upgrades for air traffic control for a very long time. When we're talking about an overhaul, what would [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=167.96s)]
*  that take? How much time would it take? Where would the money come from? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=174.44s)]
*  Yeah, all of the excellent questions, right? So first and foremost, the FAA can only, like most federal agencies, can only [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=178.44s)]
*  operate on a budget from dollars that are appropriated by Congress, right? There's no, you know, I had no pool of money I can [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=187.24s)]
*  sort of turn to. I could sort of rob Peter to pay Paul. But what you get is what you get. And so those are the choices that you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=194.76s)]
*  have to make. What I am hearing, you know, what we're all hearing from Secretary Duffy, and again, I certainly has my full support [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=201.08s)]
*  along with, you know, Chris Rosso, the acting administrator of the FAA. I'm hearing that somewhere between, you know, 15 and maybe [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  $30 billion, you know, we'll see what happens in the coming days. What are the immediate steps? You know, some of the immediate steps [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=216.12s)]
*  is to begin to address. Now, when we think about the air traffic controller shortage, that's just a long period of time. It takes [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=223.0s)]
*  about a year to get through the training. It takes another 18 to 36 months to be what we call fully qualified. This says you are a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=230.44000000000003s)]
*  certified professional controller, right? So that's not something we're going to sort of, you know, snap our fingers and have, you know, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=238.84s)]
*  correct overnight. But we can begin the process of, you know, replacing this copper wiring, dealing with communication outages that cause [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=246.44000000000003s)]
*  this concern and consternation on behalf of both the controllers and the pilots, right? We can begin the process of, you know, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=255.8s)]
*  appointing an entity that's going to oversee all of this so that we can, you know, look the American public an eye and say, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=263.16s)]
*  you know, we've got your back. We are going to do this and we're going to do it right. And, you know, I have faith that the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=270.12s)]
*  secretary is going to get that done. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=276.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEt17b2zVqk&t=285.8s)]
