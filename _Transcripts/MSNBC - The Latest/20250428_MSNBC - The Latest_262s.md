# Lawyer of 2 year old U.S.-born child sent to Honduras speaks out
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So)
*  much with us now to continue our conversation is Gracie Willis, an attorney with the National [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=0.0s)]
*  Immigration Project who represents that two-year-old U.S. citizen child removed from the U.S. Gracie, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=4.0s)]
*  thank you very much for being with us today. What happened in this girl's case? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely, thank you for having me. This is a family that had been, as was just said, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=14.0s)]
*  checking in regularly with ICE and on Tuesday the 22nd went in for a typical normal check-in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=18.8s)]
*  and were arrested. Luckily, we were able to find out only several hours after the arrest [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=26.08s)]
*  and attorneys, loved ones, community members were reaching out over days to try to find out where is [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  this family and can we speak with them and at every single point ICE denied anybody the ability [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=37.68s)]
*  to know where this family was, denied everybody the ability to contact them and communicate with [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=45.04s)]
*  them. Even a lawyer who was ready to file documents in the mother's immigration case to allow her to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  access the immigration options that she has available to her, even fathers, the father, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=54.88s)]
*  the custodian, all of these people were saying we need to understand what the mother wants, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=60.56s)]
*  the parents need to talk to each other about what's best for the child and at every level [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=66.88s)]
*  we encountered shocking indifference on the part of ICE in terms of their willingness to watch this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=70.8s)]
*  child be such a way of playing. Are you saying that the father of that child did not have the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=78.16s)]
*  opportunity to reach out and obviously, you know, not speak to the child but to speak about [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  his child with anyone? Yes, that's right. There was a one-minute phone call, there was a two-minute [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=92.0s)]
*  phone call, there's one minute of those two minutes where the father and mother were able to speak and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=98.32s)]
*  they were asserting the child's U.S. citizenship on speakerphone with the ICE officer who was in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=102.0s)]
*  the room with the mother and the ICE officer said, oh yeah, we don't know if she's going to be [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=106.8s)]
*  deported yet and as soon as the father started providing the phone number for an attorney, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=110.56s)]
*  the ICE officer hung up the phone. That was the last time they spoke to each other until the mother [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  landed in Honduras. So the government says the mother wrote a letter asking that her child, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=119.44s)]
*  U.S.-born child, go with her to Honduras. What do you say to that? The letter itself, the ICE has [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=126.8s)]
*  been misrepresenting what's in this letter. The letter, as was just stated, says my child will [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=135.84s)]
*  come with me. I will bring my child. It's not a statement of desire. It's not a statement of what [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=140.72s)]
*  the mother hoped or wanted to happen and in fact, what we now know is the mother was told your child [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=145.36s)]
*  will be deported with you and was told to write this letter that said my child will come with me. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=150.88s)]
*  She was never provided an opportunity to make a different choice. This was the choice that was [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  given to her, the only option available to her and she never had an opportunity to speak with [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=161.84s)]
*  a lawyer or to speak with the child's father to make any other different decision. So does the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=166.88s)]
*  father want that child back in the United States, the country where that child was born, back with [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=172.24s)]
*  him? Right now the family is in a very difficult situation trying to figure out what next steps [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=178.72s)]
*  are. These are conversations they should have been able to have before any of this happened. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=185.04s)]
*  This family has been through a significant trauma. The mother has an early pregnancy. She's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=189.04s)]
*  currently attending to her medical and health needs to ensure the safety of her unborn child. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=193.04s)]
*  The family is now going to have to have these conversations in even a more difficult way. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  At this point, ICE has actually retained the child's passport so the family doesn't even [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=204.64s)]
*  have the passport of this child anymore. So there's questions about logistics and there's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  questions about what's in the best interest of the kiddo and what's in the best interest of the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  family. Does the father want that child back with him in the United States? The father wants to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=217.36s)]
*  coordinate with the mom to ensure that they're on the same page and they can make a decision together [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=223.52s)]
*  about what their child, what should happen with their child. Gracie Willis, I thank you very much. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=228.0s)]
*  Let's continue this. I want to keep very close contact with you. I want to know what's going [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  on step by step in this case. I appreciate your time. Happy to continue talking. Thank you so much. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=237.12s)]
*  you [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwvOjs46So&t=247.36s)]
