# Trump doubling steel tariffs to 50 percent on Wednesday
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A)
*  President Trump plans to double tariffs on steel imports, bringing them to 50 percent, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=0.0s)]
*  which would take effect on Wednesday. The president made an announcement on Friday at a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=4.48s)]
*  steel plant in Pennsylvania. He later posted on social media that the increased tariff would also [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=8.32s)]
*  apply to aluminum products. The European Union has criticized this increase, warning that it [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=12.72s)]
*  undermines their efforts to reach a negotiated solution in the ongoing trade war between them [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  and the U.S. Meanwhile, Canada's United Steelworkers Union called the move a direct attack on its [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=22.72s)]
*  industries and workers. But Treasury Secretary Scott Besson defended the tariff increase yesterday [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=28.08s)]
*  on CBS. Do you have a prediction on how much it's going to impact the construction industry, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=33.12s)]
*  for example? Well, I have a prediction on how much it's going to impact the steel industry. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  And again, we'll see. There are a lot of elasticities that this is a very complicated [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=45.36s)]
*  ecosystem. So is it going to impact the construction industry? Maybe. But it's going [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=52.08s)]
*  to impact the steel industry in a great way. There's going to be capital investment. And [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=58.32s)]
*  the number of jobs is going to be grown around the country, whether it's in Pittsburgh, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=66.16s)]
*  whether it's in Arkansas, whether it's in Alabama. The president also on Friday promoted a, quote, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=70.08s)]
*  blockbuster deal between Japan-based Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel that he claimed would keep the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=76.96s)]
*  company American-controlled. Joining us now is White House correspondent for Reuters Jeff Mason. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=82.24s)]
*  Jeff, good morning. You were at this event on Friday in Pittsburgh. So what's the latest [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=87.28s)]
*  you're hearing from the White House on the increase on tariffs on steel imports? And what's the overall [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=91.28s)]
*  goal here? Well, good morning, Allie. Number one, it's just a continuation of President Trump's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  use of tariffs as a way to get his way and to put his economic imprint on the economy and on [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=103.2s)]
*  trade relations with other countries. He was at this event, as you mentioned, in Pittsburgh. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  And sort of this ended up being the news. He announced that increase from 25 to 50 percent [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  in a friendly crowd because he was talking about something that would be helpful to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=123.2s)]
*  their industry and that industry within an important swing state. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't have anything new to add other than to say that this is a major development in trade. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=133.04s)]
*  And I'm very curious to see today how the markets react to that. The clip that you played from CBS [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  that Margaret Brennan asked is a pretty key question. Yes, this will be good for or helpful to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=146.4s)]
*  the steel industry in the United States, and that's the reason he did it. But it will have [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=153.6s)]
*  knock on effects for other important branches and other important pieces of the economy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=157.12s)]
*  So that's something that we'll be watching today, watching the markets today, watching the continued [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=163.44s)]
*  reaction. But the European Union is already giving their reaction. They're highly critical. The [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=168.4s)]
*  president's announcement because they see it as undermining the ongoing negotiations there. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  But is there any sense from your sources that this is yet again another bargaining tactic from [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=177.6s)]
*  the president? And as we come off of a week where the idea of taco trade or the president always [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=181.92s)]
*  reversing course was a central thing that even he had to respond to, you think that's something [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=187.2s)]
*  that we end up seeing here? Well, I think that's a great question. And it's certainly something [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  that's possible. The European Union is a key trading block. And it's something that it's a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=195.92s)]
*  group of countries that the president was very critical of just about a week before when he [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=202.16s)]
*  threatened to increase the overall tariffs, not just on steel and aluminum, but to all imports [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=207.28s)]
*  from the EU to, I believe that was also to 50%. I'm losing track of some of the numbers in my head. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=212.48s)]
*  But another big jump. And then after doing that, got a call from the European Commission president, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=220.24s)]
*  that's the EU executive asking for a delay. And he agreed to do that and delayed that until July. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=228.32s)]
*  And that led to an increase in stock markets. So the term taco, which he definitely does not like, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=235.2s)]
*  was applicable then and may be applicable here too if indeed to your question, it ends up being [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=242.0s)]
*  something that was just a threat that maybe goes into effect for a little while, but then he ends [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  up pulling back down. It's hard to say. I mean, he has been more consistent with tariffs on steel [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=253.76s)]
*  and aluminum than he has on tariffs for the wider, broader economy. So it's also possible [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=260.4s)]
*  that he'll leave it in place. It's just a question that's pretty hard to answer right now because of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  the sort of volatility in his decision-making on this area and on tariffs generally. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  I think you're right to talk about the steel and aluminum tariffs slightly differently, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  just because you and I were covering them as an initial starting point on tariffs in the first [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  administration. Peter Navarro was briefing us in the briefing room even then about that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=286.88s)]
*  So I think you're right to sort of carve those out as their own thing. So we'll continue watching, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=291.12s)]
*  of course, on the tariff front. And then, of course, back in the spotlight, these peace talks [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=295.12s)]
*  between Russia and Ukraine set to start today in Istanbul after Ukraine unleashed that drone attack [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=299.28s)]
*  on Russia, damaging more than 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases. I think it was the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=305.44s)]
*  ingenuity and the way that this was done that's really getting a lot of people's reaction here [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=310.88s)]
*  but what are you hearing from the White House? Were they given a heads up about this? What was [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=316.72s)]
*  their involvement? What do we know here? I haven't heard them say that they got a heads up [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=320.72s)]
*  and I think this will probably just add complications to those talks in the same way [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  that the multiple attacks that Russia has carried out on Ukraine has added complications to the talks. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=332.88000000000005s)]
*  President Trump has been very clear that he is unhappy with both President Putin of Russia and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=340.72s)]
*  with President Zelensky of Ukraine. I was on the tarmac in New Jersey over a week ago when he was [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=346.0s)]
*  flying home and came out and took questions and was super critical of Putin but I asked him then, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=353.92s)]
*  so what are you going to do about it? And he bristled at that question and didn't like being [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=360.32s)]
*  asked that and that's still the key question is what is he going to do about the fact that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=366.88s)]
*  Russia has continued to defy him. Ukraine is, I guess, I don't know if he would view this as [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=372.24s)]
*  defiance or not but he has continued to say over and over again that he doesn't like the way [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  Zelensky is behaving either. So I think broadly to your question it's just another [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=385.44s)]
*  complicating factor at a time when the United States is trying to broker a peace deal. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=389.6s)]
*  The two sides are talking but they're not getting closer to a ceasefire. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=395.2s)]
*  Yeah and then Jeff as we finish this first segment of our show I want to end where we began which is [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  on that attack that happened in Boulder, Colorado. What kind of updates has the administration given? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=406.16s)]
*  I know the president was briefed on this of course. Yeah well and I'm a Coloradan myself so [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=411.68s)]
*  my heart goes out to everyone who is affected by this horrible event. No updates from the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=418.16s)]
*  administration. Surely it is something that the president has been briefed on and that he'll be [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=424.96s)]
*  watching and the White House will be watching and clearly the federal government is involved in [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=430.4s)]
*  looking at this too as a terror attack. And of course the broader issue of this being [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=437.2s)]
*  just one more in the latest number of attacks related to what people are referring to as [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=445.2s)]
*  anti-Semitism and hate crimes. Yeah many in the Jewish community on edge especially after what [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=453.12s)]
*  happened here in Washington DC. The shooting of those two staffers from the Israeli embassy. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=459.6s)]
*  Hard not to look at this as a pattern that no one wants to see emerging of anti-Semitic acts [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=464.88s)]
*  in this country. There's no place for it here. Jeff Mason thank you for coming on and covering it all. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  you [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-G8rPya6A&t=482.24s)]
