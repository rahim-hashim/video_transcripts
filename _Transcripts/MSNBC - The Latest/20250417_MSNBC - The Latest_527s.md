Video Description: Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s legal team is responding to the government’s release of records from a 2019 arrest that suggest he was a suspected member of the MS-13 gang. His legal team denies these allegations and say the documents show he has “never been convicted of a crime.” NBC News’ Julia Ainsley reports more details on the case. Former federal prosecutors Carol Lam and Kristy Greenberg join Ana Cabrera to share their legal analysis.

# Judge should 'decide his fate – not social media': Abrego Garcia's lawyers hit back at Trump admin
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8)
*  Julia, we have this new statement now coming from Abrego Garcia's attorneys this morning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=0.0s)]
*  in response to the DOJ's release of those documents from 2019. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=5.0s)]
*  Fill us in. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this is really interesting. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Of course, they had a lot to respond to yesterday when all of a sudden these documents were [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=13.32s)]
*  kind of dumped out of nowhere after so much talking. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=16.92s)]
*  And what they're really saying here is that there needs to be due process. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=19.92s)]
*  Of course, they've been saying that all along. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=22.94s)]
*  Take a look at what they've said. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=24.86s)]
*  They say, to be clear, Mr. Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of a crime. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=26.6s)]
*  If the government believes there is a legitimate case to be made, it should present that case [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=30.64s)]
*  in a court of law and have a judge review and decide his fate, not on social media. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=34.58s)]
*  And Ana, we also heard from Vasquez Sura, his wife, who is saying that she's pushing [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  back on this idea that he is violent because they released something she filed that was [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=47.72s)]
*  for a civil protective order. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  When she was alleging possible domestic violence, that was another thing that we saw released [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=56.64s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=61.52s)]
*  She has since put out a statement, and I think it's really important to read this one carefully. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=62.52s)]
*  So I'll read this to you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=66.0s)]
*  After surviving domestic violence in a previous relationship, I acted out of caution after [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=67.36s)]
*  a disagreement with Comar by seeking a civil protective order in case things escalated. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=73.44s)]
*  Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the silver court process. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=78.36s)]
*  Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=83.4s)]
*  No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=85.92s)]
*  That is not a justification for ISIS action of abducting him and deporting him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=88.28s)]
*  So of course, there's a lot that's being put out into public now, both about their marriage [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  and about the arrest, and that's because the Justice Department and DHS and, of course, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=97.48s)]
*  the White House from the podium yesterday have wanted to paint a very different picture [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=102.22s)]
*  of Abrego Garcia. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=106.0s)]
*  It's difficult, though, because they can put out documents without those actually going [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=107.6s)]
*  through a court of law where someone like his wife would be able to explain or you would [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  be able to interview the police who arrested him and for the government to actually have [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=115.82s)]
*  to present their evidence to a judge or to a jury. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=120.89999999999999s)]
*  It's really all just throwing it out to the public and waiting for these kind of reactions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  And so what they're asking for here is due process to bring him back, and if they have [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=128.66s)]
*  enough evidence to remove his legal protection to stay in the United States, they'd like [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=132.4s)]
*  to do that in a court of law. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=136.66s)]
*  So Carol, do these documents that the Trump administration just made public from 2019 [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  related to domestic violence allegations or this gang affiliation evidence that they [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=143.9s)]
*  claim or it is evidence that's not even clear at this point whether it really is, the DOJ [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=151.06s)]
*  says it is, do they change the fundamentals of whether or not Abrego Garcia should have [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=156.78s)]
*  been deported? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  No, of course it doesn't change the fundamentals. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=163.70000000000002s)]
*  These are allegations and everyone who stepped into a courtroom knows that allegations once [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=167.92s)]
*  subject to cross-examination or denial or opposing facts often turn out not to be true [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=174.57999999999998s)]
*  or often turn out to be not quite what they were alleged to be. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=182.27999999999997s)]
*  And Julia is quite right. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  All that is being asked for here is due process. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  And the Supreme Court has said, give him due process, give these people due process. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=190.88s)]
*  And that is not a very high bar for folks to meet. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=195.56s)]
*  I mean, this is the basis of American jurisprudence. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=199.24s)]
*  You are not deported, you're not put in jail, you're not arrested just based on the thinnest [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=202.8s)]
*  of smoke. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=209.72s)]
*  So Julia is quite right. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=210.72s)]
*  All that's being asked for here is due process. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=211.88s)]
*  Yeah, at this point, no one's saying that he's totally innocent or can't face deportation, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=214.12s)]
*  but the administration has already admitted that he was mistakenly deported, that he should [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=221.36s)]
*  not have been deported. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  Julia, we're also learning more about what information Abrego Garcia's lawyers want now [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=228.24s)]
*  from the DOJ as this process moves forward. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=232.72000000000003s)]
*  What do they say? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=235.58s)]
*  Well, it's not clear what they'll get, but I'll tell you what they're asking because [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=236.58s)]
*  if we got this information, it would shed light not just on Abrego Garcia's case, but [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=240.84s)]
*  really on the whole operation between the U.S. and El Salvador. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=244.96s)]
*  They're asking for really a copy of the contract between the U.S. and El Salvador, exactly [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=248.52s)]
*  how long these men are supposed to be sent there, what El Salvador is getting in return [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=253.56s)]
*  in terms of compensation. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=257.68s)]
*  We've heard six million. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=259.32s)]
*  Is that for how many people over what timeframe? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  Of course, we've also heard Trump ask the president of El Salvador to increase his capacity. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=262.88s)]
*  And recently we've heard President Bukele said he could double that capacity. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=268.08s)]
*  They're asking for a lot of things, especially as it comes down to what, under what circumstances [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=272.04s)]
*  Abrego Garcia can be held there and if he could have access to an attorney to be brought [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=278.12s)]
*  back. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  Not clear they'll get those answers, but that's what they're asking. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  And Christy, they're asking for depositions as well from the Trump administration officials, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=286.32s)]
*  including members of ICE, members of the State Department who may have had a hand related [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=290.64s)]
*  to this particular case. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=296.76s)]
*  What could those depositions reveal? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=298.78s)]
*  Well, I think the first step will be who is getting deposed. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=300.36s)]
*  One of the challenges in this case has really been determining who is involved, who's making [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=305.16s)]
*  the decisions. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  And every time the judge tries to ask those questions, she gets answers from the DOJ attorney [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  that I don't know. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=317.16s)]
*  I don't have that information. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  And so she's, I think with these depositions, what we're really trying to do is get to the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=320.24s)]
*  people who actually have personal knowledge, get to the people who are deciding. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  Has anybody actually asked anybody in El Salvador to facilitate his return? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=328.36s)]
*  It sounds like the answer to that is no. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=332.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, who is making the decision not to make that request? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=334.72s)]
*  So I think getting to who it is that will be in those depositions is the first step. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=338.32s)]
*  And then once you get the decision makers in there, right, it's what steps have you [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=342.52s)]
*  taken? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=346.88s)]
*  It sounds like nothing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=347.88s)]
*  And then why haven't these steps being taken? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=349.18s)]
*  Are you planning to do anything to facilitate his return? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=351.76s)]
*  What would that look like? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=354.7s)]
*  So I think they're planning to get into those kinds of issues in these depositions, which [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=356.28s)]
*  will be critical to determining if there is going to be a contempt finding in that case. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=361.32s)]
*  I mean, it does feel like they are just blatantly not going along with her order. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=366.12s)]
*  The response from somebody at DHS yesterday, the general counsel from DHS was given the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=371.64s)]
*  government's prior clear and unequivocal notice to the court regarding how the government [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=379.24s)]
*  will facilitate our Brego Garcia's return within the counters of existing law and regulation. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=383.32s)]
*  There are no further updates. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=388.32s)]
*  So she's asking for a daily update. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=389.48s)]
*  And he's saying we've already given you everything we've had. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=390.84s)]
*  And she said you've given me nothing. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=392.88s)]
*  It's like we're taking crazy pills right now. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=395.11999999999995s)]
*  Then there's Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, who traveled to El Salvador yesterday to try [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  to get a Brego Garcia home. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=401.67999999999995s)]
*  And here's what he said about his meeting with El Salvador's vice president. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=403.23999999999995s)]
*  Listen, I asked the vice president if a Brego Garcia has not committed a crime. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  Why is El Salvador continuing to hold him in CECA? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=416.72s)]
*  And his answer was that the Trump administration is paying El Salvador, the government of El [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=421.04s)]
*  Salvador, to keep him at CECA. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=430.86s)]
*  Christy, what do you make of that? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  None of it makes any sense. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=440.08000000000004s)]
*  There is an order in place from the court. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=441.6s)]
*  I mean, that clearly says he could be removed to pretty much any other country. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=444.24s)]
*  He cannot be removed to El Salvador. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=450.12s)]
*  A court found, a judge found, that if he were to be removed to El Salvador, he could be [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=452.12s)]
*  persecuted there. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=457.0s)]
*  And so what did they do? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=458.44s)]
*  They removed him to the one country that the judge said you can't remove him to, and they [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=459.44s)]
*  put him in a prison that is known for human rights abuses. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, this idea that this prison is somehow OK. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=467.16s)]
*  In the court, what the Trump administration says in their court papers and then what they [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=472.68s)]
*  say on TV are two very different things. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=477.12s)]
*  In the court papers, they say, well, there's no torture here. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=479.12s)]
*  We would never torture anyone. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=481.44s)]
*  And then you have these propaganda videos where we see exactly how these people are [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  being treated, and it's horrific. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=487.20000000000005s)]
*  And again, as you point out, he has never been charged, either in El Salvador or in [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=489.16s)]
*  the United States, much less convicted of a crime. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  So there is no reason for him. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=498.52s)]
*  You can deport someone, and you can go through that process legally. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=500.59999999999997s)]
*  There's no reason to put them in a foreign torture prison like that. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZc0WWLmqM8&t=503.44s)]
