# 'Very challenging and dangerous moment': Sen. Coons reacts to Iran strikes on Israel
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk)
*  Joining us now, we have Senator Chris Coons of Delaware. Senator Coons is a member of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=0.0s)]
*  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Judiciary Committee. Senator, I want to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=5.04s)]
*  ask you, looking at these images of smoke rising over Tel Aviv, what we know about Israel's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=8.76s)]
*  attacks on Tehran overnight, where does this put the U.S.? What is the U.S. position in [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=13.84s)]
*  the Middle East now? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=20.28s)]
*  Because we have heard from the White House that they did have prior knowledge, but that's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=21.28s)]
*  not the same as prior approval. But that doesn't make it any more complicated for the Trump [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  administration to try to negotiate with Iran right now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=29.32s)]
*  Well, Christina, that's right. We're in a very challenging and dangerous moment. And my first [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=31.92s)]
*  concern, of course, is about the safety of the men and women of the American Armed Forces [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=38.96s)]
*  who are serving throughout the region. Tens of thousands of our service members are deployed [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=43.6s)]
*  throughout the Middle East in different bases in different countries. And it's my hope that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=49.44s)]
*  strike them, recognizing, as President Trump said, that we did not authorize or participate [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=55.04s)]
*  in this preemptive attack on Iran, that Iran will hold back from attacking any Americans. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=61.68s)]
*  But we also have to be mindful there's hundreds of thousands of American citizens who live [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=68.96s)]
*  in Israel and who, even now, as Iran is launching its response attacks into Israel, that puts [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=73.08s)]
*  at risk the lives of Israeli civilians and a significant number of Americans as well. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=80.68s)]
*  I'm encouraged that President Trump had been trying to negotiate a deal with Iran to constrain [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  their aggressive actions in the region, their missile program, their support for dangerous [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  proxies like the Houthis and Hamas and Hezbollah, and to significantly constrain or end their [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=98.84s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  President Trump is calling on the Iranians to come to the negotiating table and make [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=109.28s)]
*  a strong and lasting deal fast. I will remind you part of why we were not in an agreement [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  with Iran that constrained their nuclear program was because President Trump in his previous [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  term walked away from it, even though back then we had real partnership from China, Russia, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  and our European allies in pursuing that path. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=132.24s)]
*  So part of what precipitated this attack on Iran by Israel in the last few days was a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=135.60000000000002s)]
*  finding by the International Atomic Watchdog that Iran had significantly increased its [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=143.12s)]
*  enrichment and Iran's response, announcing yet another enrichment facility. I will be [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=150.3s)]
*  looking for a classified update when I return to Washington to make sure I understand the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=157.0s)]
*  details of these attacks, the justification offered by the Israeli government, and the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=163.12s)]
*  consequences for stability and security in the region. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=169.2s)]
*  And Senator, I want to pause right now because we have live images of the skyline of Tel [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=171.92s)]
*  Aviv, and it's hard to tell at this point what is going on, but it appeared another [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=176.32s)]
*  interceptor just went off and met something there in the sky. You can see the camera panning [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=179.48s)]
*  to what looked like lights, possibly rockets, possibly missiles heading in the sky over [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=184.48s)]
*  Tel Aviv. We'll wait for confirmation as to what exactly is going on there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=189.11999999999998s)]
*  But I also want to ask you about the complications of this for the United States because the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  U.S. policy is so inextricably tied with Israeli policy, given the decades of strong allyship [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  between those two countries, that when there is a division on how to proceed, like in Iran, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=205.72s)]
*  administration have both tried to hold back the reins on this out of fear that this conflict [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=212.36s)]
*  could spill over and ignite the region. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=217.32000000000002s)]
*  No matter what Israel does, it seems Iran is going to tie it to the United States. We [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=220.08s)]
*  have the Iranian foreign minister today saying, quote, without this, this attack could not [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=225.4s)]
*  have happened without the coordination and approval of the United States. How do you [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  get around that? Do you think you should see do you want to see a more strenuous, strongly [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=236.6s)]
*  worded separation from the White House? Or is it in America's best interest to try to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  get on board and salvage what they can within the terms that have already been set by Netanyahu [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=247.44s)]
*  at this point? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=253.0s)]
*  Well, look, Secretary of State Marco Rubio put out a statement last night that tried [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=254.0s)]
*  to make that separation to make it clear that the Trump administration had not approved [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=260.24s)]
*  or facilitated or supported these attacks on Iran and was largely silent on what position [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=266.56s)]
*  the Trump administration was taking on Israel's attack on Iran. I have long supported Israel's [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=273.44s)]
*  right to defend itself. And along with many Democrats and Republicans in Congress, I've [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=279.84s)]
*  said for years that we cannot tolerate a nuclear armed Iran. But I have also long preferred [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=285.24s)]
*  a diplomatic path, if at all possible, because every assessment I've got in the past was [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=291.8s)]
*  that a military end to Iran's nuclear program was not feasible and, in fact, might actually [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=297.08s)]
*  drive them more rapidly into the direction of developing a usable nuclear weapon. In [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  the last few years, Iran has dramatically increased its enrichment activity. I think [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  they are a more dangerous regional player. And I think it's hard to talk about this [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=315.52s)]
*  region in this context without also mentioning the horrific attack on Israel by Hamas on [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=321.02000000000004s)]
*  October 7th and the consequences that has had for the region, for Gaza, for the population [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=326.6s)]
*  of Gaza, and the striking actions by Israel against Hezbollah. This entire region has [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  fundamentally been reshaped in the events after October 7th. And we in the Congress [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=338.90000000000003s)]
*  need to be engaged in a constructive way in setting a better path forward that can reduce [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=344.9s)]
*  the risk to the region from Iran's aggression, its support for its proxies, and to try and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=350.9s)]
*  find a path that will end Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu and the Israeli government have [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=356.34s)]
*  said their hand was forced. They couldn't wait because Iran suddenly seemed very close [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=362.64s)]
*  within days of reaching that breakout time, which is that threshold, 90 percent enriched [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=367.9s)]
*  uranium, which could be used to make a functional nuclear weapon. You get much better briefings [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=373.66s)]
*  than I do, sir. Does that track with the intelligence that you've been following? Was Iran really [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=380.46000000000004s)]
*  that close to having a functional weapon, or was there more room here for negotiation? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=385.14000000000004s)]
*  I'm going to be getting a classified briefing when I return to Washington early next week. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=392.46000000000004s)]
*  As I just shared with you, it's public information that the IAEA, which is the world's nuclear [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=398.46s)]
*  watchdog agency, declared last week that Iran was outside of its nonproliferation treaty [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=404.7s)]
*  obligations. That's a technical way of saying Iran was making dangerous and rapid progress [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=410.97999999999996s)]
*  towards having enough fissile material for a weapon. That's distinct from actually having [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=416.85999999999996s)]
*  a working weapon, but they were clearly making progress in that direction. They have a large [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=421.82s)]
*  stockpile of 60 percent enriched uranium. President Trump and his emissary, Mr. Witkoff, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=426.94s)]
*  have been trying to negotiate with Iran a deal that would constrain this program. Their [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=433.14s)]
*  next negotiating session was supposed to be this Sunday, and President Trump is still [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=438.29999999999995s)]
*  urging them to come back to the table and to voluntarily give up their nuclear program. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  We'll see whether this action by Israel creates that possibility or whether several days of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=449.14s)]
*  military exchanges will make that impossible. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=454.26000000000005s)]
*  All right, Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, thank you so much for taking the time to be [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=456.62s)]
*  with us today, sir. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYbTQHGRXk&t=460.94000000000005s)]
