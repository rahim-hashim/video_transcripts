# 'Unlawful': Judge blasts DOGE's takeover of U.S. Institute of Peace
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo)
*  Elon Musk and Doge dealt a major legal blow over their bid to take over the US Institute of Peace. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=0.0s)]
*  The Institute is an independent nonprofit group founded by Congress to resolve violent conflicts. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=6.24s)]
*  Now, a federal judge ruled just yesterday that the Trump administration didn't have the authority to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=11.84s)]
*  fire its employees. And that changes at the Institute were, quote, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=17.04s)]
*  effectuated by illegitimately installed leaders and must therefore be declared dull and void. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=21.36s)]
*  Now, this ruling, after a dramatic standoff in March, where you might recall the Institute's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=27.84s)]
*  acting president declared Doge had broken into their building before carrying out mass layoffs. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=33.04s)]
*  For more on this, let's bring in George Foote, outside general counsel for the US Institute of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  Peace. He has worked with the agency for more than three decades. George, thanks for taking the time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=44.32s)]
*  This is a big victory for you and your team. What did you make of the judge's ruling? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Oh, we were delighted. It was a good decision. It was long, well-reasoned, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=54.56s)]
*  and upheld every claim that we made in the case that the USIP is not part of the executive branch [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  and that the president had no authority to do what he did. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=67.36s)]
*  For people who aren't familiar with the US Institute of Peace, can you explain [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  what it does and the impact of its work getting halted this spring? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=74.64s)]
*  It does so much. It was created about 40 years ago to be a think tank and to help the United States [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=77.6s)]
*  figure out ways to prevent conflict, to mitigate conflicts once they got started, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=86.8s)]
*  and to stop them and to keep them starting again. Since that time, its work has expanded around the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=92.08s)]
*  world. They've worked in every conflict zone you can imagine since the 1980s and have added a lot [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=97.44s)]
*  to America's soft power and to save lives of our soldiers and our civilians all over the world. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=103.36s)]
*  The US Institute of Peace has effectively now been shut down since March. Are your clients [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=111.36s)]
*  concerned that they may not be able to rebuild what they once were? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=115.52s)]
*  It took a blow, of course, but the culture of the place is intact. The staff is leaning forward. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=121.36s)]
*  They're ready to go back to work. All of the top management is standing by, ready to move back into [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=127.12s)]
*  the building. The board is ready to get back to work. It'll take a while. There's been a lot of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=132.56s)]
*  damage done and a lot of the foreign programs are in ashes and there will have to be some [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=138.32s)]
*  reconstruction, but no, they'll get back to work. This is a dedicated bunch. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=143.36s)]
*  And yet the White House is signaling this isn't the end of the line for them legally and they [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=147.2s)]
*  plan to continue to fighting. The White House saying this in response to the judge's ruling [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=151.6s)]
*  yesterday, the United States Institute of Peace has existed for 40 years on a $50 million annual [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=156.08s)]
*  budget, but failed to deliver peace. President Trump is right to reduce failed useless entities [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=162.96s)]
*  like USIP, adding this rogue judge's attempt to impede on the separation of powers will not [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  be the last say on the matter. What's your reaction to that? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=174.56s)]
*  The government certainly has a right to appeal. We haven't heard whether they're going to do that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=179.44s)]
*  or what they will do, but the folks at the Institute of Peace know that peace is a process, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=184.16s)]
*  that it's going to take a long time to solve any given conflict and there'll always be a new one. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=189.68s)]
*  So they're ready to keep working. They've been effective in many ways that they have worked. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=193.84s)]
*  And that $50 million, it represents less than one half of 1% of 1% of the defense budget. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=199.76s)]
*  And they make you go a long way and they do an awful lot of peace building with that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=207.04s)]
*  Peace is a process. George Foote, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=210.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0t9NQAQxMo&t=214.16s)]
