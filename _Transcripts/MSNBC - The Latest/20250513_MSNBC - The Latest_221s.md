*  Raheima, what are we learning as Ventura takes the stand? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=31.16s)]
*  Bring us any color from the courtroom as well. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=33.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=37.56s)]
*  She is on the stand, called by the prosecution as a witness. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=39.04s)]
*  We understand that as she is talking, Combs is leaning back and watching her intently. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=42.64s)]
*  She described that now she is 38 years old, that she became involved with Sean Diddy when [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=48.34s)]
*  she was 19. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=54.54s)]
*  She said that they were in a relationship for 10 years. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=55.96s)]
*  They were consistently on and off relationship. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=60.08s)]
*  She described it as they would have lots of arguments, violent arguments, she said, usually [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=63.88s)]
*  resulted in physical abuse, dragging, different things. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=68.36s)]
*  He would mash my head, knock me over, drag me, kick me. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=71.92s)]
*  She's asked by the prosecution how frequently, her answer, frequently, were you ever injured? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=75.84s)]
*  Her answer, yes, usually I would get knocks on my forehead, black eyes, red eyes, bruises [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=81.28s)]
*  all over my body. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=86.84s)]
*  It just depended. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  And then she showed, she showed a still image of that infamous video from the Los Angeles [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=89.72s)]
*  hotel where he is assaulting her. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=95.22s)]
*  And she says in response to that, that's me, Intercontinental Hotel, having an encounter, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=97.8s)]
*  we call it a freak off. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=103.72s)]
*  Now how would you describe what a freak off is? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=105.32s)]
*  She explains that, of having sexual encounters called a voyeurism, a sexual encounter with [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=107.72s)]
*  a third party. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=112.92s)]
*  And she pointed out that this was something that Sean Combs introduced to her. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=113.92s)]
*  And she said that she at some times would be in charge of hiring the person. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=119.76s)]
*  And she would do it because she wanted to make him happy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=125.88s)]
*  She was in love with him. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=128.36s)]
*  But she was also asked, what were you afraid of? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=129.96s)]
*  She says, it was always in the back of my mind that I would somehow be hurt by him. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=133.8s)]
*  Sean is a really polarizing person. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=139.52s)]
*  He was very charming. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=142.54000000000002s)]
*  It was hard to decide in that moment when he was telling you what he wanted. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=144.08s)]
*  I just didn't know what would happen. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=147.44s)]
*  And then the testimony goes on to talk about, and she is taking a deep sigh at this moment. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=150.52s)]
*  We should point out that she is in her eighth month of pregnancy with her third baby. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=156.84s)]
*  She's asked by the prosecution, you talk about blackmail materials. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  She says actual videos and photos of sexual encounters. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=167.24s)]
*  And she was concerned that if ever those, she did not do what Combs wanted her to do, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=170.56s)]
*  that those videos would be released and it would be damaging to her career. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  Anna? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Raheem Ellis, very disturbing details. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much for bringing us that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  It's just the start of Cassie Ventura's testimony. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  Again, the prosecution's star witness in this trial against Sean Diddy Combs. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=190.84s)]
*  And she could be on the stand for hours, if not days. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  Keep us posted. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=199.08s)]
*  Raheema, thank you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JdCFFDJKqk&t=200.08s)]
