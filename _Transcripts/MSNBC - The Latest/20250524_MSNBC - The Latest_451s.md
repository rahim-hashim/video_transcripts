# Minnesota AG: Dismissal of police dissent decrees sends message that ‘DOJ is not a partner’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA)
*  Tomorrow marks five years since George Floyd's death, and though his murder led to thousands [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=0.0s)]
*  of nationwide protests against police brutality, the country is now moving backwards when it [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=7.44s)]
*  comes to police reform. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=12.3s)]
*  This week, Trump's Justice Department announced it would dismiss civil rights investigations [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=14.32s)]
*  into several local police departments, including those filed against two city departments, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=18.44s)]
*  Louisville and Minneapolis, during the Biden administration. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=23.88s)]
*  Hours to end, qualified immunity for police officers have gone nowhere, as President [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=28.12s)]
*  Trump signed an executive order last month designed to, quote, strengthen and expand [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=32.36s)]
*  legal protections for police officers. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=37.72s)]
*  It's a big shift from the justice Minnesota's attorney general called for after the guilty [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=41.28s)]
*  verdict in Floyd's murder. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=46.3s)]
*  We need true justice. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=49.56s)]
*  That's not one case. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=52.2s)]
*  That is a social transformation that says that nobody's beneath the law and no one is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=54.04s)]
*  above it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  This verdict reminds us that we must make enduring systemic societal change. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=61.82s)]
*  And we are joined now by the attorney general of the great state of Minnesota, Keith Ellison. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=70.84s)]
*  Attorney General Ellison, thank you for coming to the weekend. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=75.56s)]
*  Look, the Justice Department rescinded the consent decree that was just signed, what [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=82.0s)]
*  was it, back in January with Minneapolis. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=88.4s)]
*  They've done that, but talk about the practical effect. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  What impact will removing that consent decree actually have on Minneapolis? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=96.64s)]
*  Well, probably not too much, because the state of Minnesota, through the Minnesota Department [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  of Human Rights, represented by the attorney general's office, did sue the city of Minneapolis [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=109.28s)]
*  and we achieved our own version of a consent decree. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=115.08s)]
*  So we already have a program of reducing choke holes, reducing high speed chase, no knock [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=118.68s)]
*  warrants, and we've had a number of reforms at the state level as well. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=129.2s)]
*  So this is really more the symbol that it sends, which is that the DOJ is not a partner [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=134.56s)]
*  for cities and states when it comes to improving police community relations, and that's really [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=141.48s)]
*  sad to tell the truth. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=147.8s)]
*  On Friday, the New York Times, in a five years after Floyd, an article that they had, so [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=151.68s)]
*  why didn't much change over the last five years? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=157.16s)]
*  Experts cite two reasons. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=159.84s)]
*  Lawmakers did not embrace all the proposed changes. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=161.56s)]
*  Ohio, Minnesota, and Missouri, for example, rejected more than 98% of the proposals that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=164.52s)]
*  came before the legislatures, according to the Brookings Institution. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=169.4s)]
*  Then the murder rate rose in 2020 and 2021, and public sentiment shifted. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  Voters wanted the police to focus on crime. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=177.32000000000002s)]
*  Attention to reform faded. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  Also, changes didn't go far enough to transform the nature of American policing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  I would also add in there, it is you have to fix the culture, right? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=187.56s)]
*  Because when you're talking about policing and black bodies, you can't just focus on [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=192.04s)]
*  the legislature. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  You have to fix the culture. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  So you say that we should have, we should still be hopeful. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, because we're still breathing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  We still are standing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=206.0s)]
*  I think that we should always be pushing forward, and cynicism in my life's experience, Eugene, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=208.2s)]
*  has never really achieved anything. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  The easiest thing in the world to say, nothing can be done, everything is terrible. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=216.68s)]
*  Well, you know, it's not great, but I'm still willing to fight for it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=220.36s)]
*  We did achieve some things. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=224.6s)]
*  I don't know where they got that 98% number. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=226.44s)]
*  I don't even, you know, I didn't read that article, but I can tell you that we have had [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=228.56s)]
*  substantial changes in Minneapolis. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=234.16s)]
*  Again, but even though we made those changes, we still had officer-involved deaths. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  the case for some sort of a panacea magic wand. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=242.92s)]
*  I will say, though, that people are going to keep on pushing forward. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=246.67999999999998s)]
*  People are going to continue to protest. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=251.04s)]
*  And I believe we're going to achieve that justice that I pray for. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=253.32s)]
*  Attorney General, let's look at a Pew survey that was recently conducted. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=260.12s)]
*  Public support for Black Lives Matter, it reached a high mark in June 2020, and around [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=265.4s)]
*  67% of U.S. adults expressed support. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=271.68s)]
*  But then by September 2020, it had gone down to 55%. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=275.88s)]
*  And so then again, support went down in 2023 when around half of Americans said they supported [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=281.08s)]
*  the movement. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=287.32s)]
*  Now it's kind of leveled off with around 52% of Americans supporting Black Lives Matter [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=288.32s)]
*  and another 45 saying they don't support. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=293.4s)]
*  What do you make of these numbers five years after the murder of George Floyd? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=296.56s)]
*  Well, what I make of those numbers is that we do live in a period of backlash to a certain [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=301.24s)]
*  extent. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=308.04s)]
*  What I make of those numbers is that we live in a time when you have a big thrust towards [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=309.04s)]
*  justice and a more inclusive society. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=315.88s)]
*  People who don't want it, they're going to get busy too. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=319.94s)]
*  And that's sort of how I would explain those numbers. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=323.72s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=327.36s)]
*  At the end of the day, people do want a good relationship between police and community. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=328.36s)]
*  And that relationship is what fosters trust and has the effect of improving public safety [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=333.6s)]
*  and human and civil rights. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=342.38s)]
*  So the case is still strong, that if we take this issue seriously, we will have safer communities [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=344.76s)]
*  and we will have more constitutional societies which observe everyone's human and civil rights. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=352.2s)]
*  I mean, look at all the civil rights cases, judgments that cities have to pay out, an [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=358.84s)]
*  enormous amount of money over the course of time. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=366.28s)]
*  You know, money that could have been going for anything else. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=369.52s)]
*  Look at all of the damage that civil unrest causes. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=372.41999999999996s)]
*  Very expensive. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=377.09999999999997s)]
*  It is not in the interest of our society to have these enduring problems between police [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=378.34000000000003s)]
*  and community. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=384.14000000000004s)]
*  Unfortunately, President Trump has exacerbated the problem, but there are still people on [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=385.46000000000004s)]
*  the ground fighting to improve it every day, including police officers and citizens. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=390.98s)]
*  Atty. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=395.38s)]
*  General, one real quick question. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=396.38s)]
*  We have less than 30 seconds. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=398.38s)]
*  You know there is the rumor and an effort out there to get a federal pardon for Derek [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=399.74s)]
*  Chauvin, the former police officer who murdered George Floyd. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=405.42s)]
*  Just real quickly, do you think that will happen? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=409.58000000000004s)]
*  You know what, I've given up on wondering about it, Jonathan. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=414.22s)]
*  If he does, he's just coming straight back to Minnesota to do the remainder of his 22 [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=418.02000000000004s)]
*  and a half year sentence. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=422.54s)]
*  It would not help Derek Chauvin. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=424.06s)]
*  It would make his life worse, but I know that Trump doesn't care about that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GGoh5bZ3QA&t=426.26s)]
