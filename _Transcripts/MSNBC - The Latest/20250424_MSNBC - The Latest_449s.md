# Judge temporarily blocks Trump admin’s efforts to end DEI in K-12 public schools
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk)
*  Breaking news from the federal courts has been a full busy morning of breaking news after breaking news a judge has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=0.0s)]
*  Temporarily blocked the president's push to end diversity equity and inclusion efforts in our public schools [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=7.32s)]
*  It impacts K through 12 schools that are at risk of losing federal funding [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  This after he signed a flurry of executive orders the president that include calling on the education department to overhaul the accreditation process [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  That currently ensures universities meet certain standards before receiving federal funds and taking aim at the Obama era [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=25.14s)]
*  policies that were meant to end [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=32.26s)]
*  suspension and expulsion practices [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=34.54s)]
*  disproportionately impacting students of color [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  Joining us now John King jr. Secretary of Education under President Obama and now Chancellor of the State University of New York John [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=39.34s)]
*  It's always a pleasure to see you. I thank you for your time. You're the author of the new book teacher by teacher [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=45.72s)]
*  So John, how do you see this? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=52.14s)]
*  Temporary block by the courts of the Trump administration's efforts to end DEI in K through 12 [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=54.38s)]
*  I'm pleased to hear that and not surprised [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=61.18000000000001s)]
*  administration's position on DEI [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=64.38000000000001s)]
*  Has always been inconsistent with core American values America's built on diversity our civil rights laws [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=66.42s)]
*  Seek to advance equity and inclusion [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=74.38s)]
*  So pleased to see this and I hope it's the start of a broader national conversation about [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=77.53999999999999s)]
*  Returning to a focus on helping our students succeed rather than these culture wars distractions [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=83.94s)]
*  And but is it a culture war? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=90.1s)]
*  distraction to focus in on not DEI as a principal but how it has been [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=93.86s)]
*  instituted in the different ways by the federal government and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=100.42s)]
*  Specifically the Department of Education which the president wants to shut down [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=104.7s)]
*  Look there's always a useful conversation to have about making sure that we implement any initiative. Well, the Obama era [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=109.26s)]
*  efforts around discipline reform were really designed to ensure that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=117.74s)]
*  Black students Latino students were not being [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=121.98s)]
*  disproportionately [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=125.34s)]
*  Suspended from school. It was an effort to make sure that rules weren't in place that might [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  Unfairly target students of color for example rules around [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=131.62s)]
*  Hairstyles that might be designed in ways that were discriminatory towards students of color [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=136.82s)]
*  I'm proud of that work that we did in the Obama administration [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=143.14s)]
*  And I think the the current administration's attack on those efforts is is disingenuous [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=145.94s)]
*  The different programs and I'm just thinking that no child left behind and then what came when you were there [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=153.26s)]
*  These different programs focused on things that are different than the as you call it the culture war [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=161.1s)]
*  discussions that we're seeing [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=169.1s)]
*  That's exactly right. Look from [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=171.54s)]
*  1980 to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=174.06s)]
*  2017 if you look at the progress that was made you see that the gap in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  performance between [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=182.34s)]
*  Black and Latino students and white students was closing steadily during that period [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=183.78s)]
*  That ended [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=189.14s)]
*  During that first Trump administration you saw [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=191.14s)]
*  Efforts at improvement stall out because there was a shift in focus to culture wars issues [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=194.82s)]
*  And then of course we had kovat and today's student performance below where it was before kovat [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=200.54s)]
*  We ought to be having an urgent conversation about how we help our students catch up in reading and math help them [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=205.66s)]
*  Get to school. We have so many students who are chronically absent [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=212.26s)]
*  But instead the administration is focused on these culture wars issues [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=215.22s)]
*  And John when it comes to those executive orders the issue of college accreditors [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=219.98s)]
*  What what is the significance of them being targeted and what specifically do they do? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=224.7s)]
*  You know the administration's approach really was to attack two things [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=230.86s)]
*  One was again to continue this attack on diversity equity inclusion to somehow imply that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=234.86s)]
*  Colleges and universities were only trying to help students feel included because of the creditors [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=241.01999999999998s)]
*  Obviously, that's not right diversity equity inclusion work is core to what we do in higher education [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=247.1s)]
*  but the second more [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=252.26s)]
*  Dangerous piece of their accreditor executive order in some ways was the idea that they're going to make it easier for there to be new [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  accreditors with potentially looser standards and this is what you saw during the first Trump administration where [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=262.62s)]
*  Accreditors were encouraged to allow [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=269.84s)]
*  Predatory for-profit colleges to take advantage of students, and I'm very worried about that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=272.76s)]
*  There's a history of these predatory colleges essentially stealing students Pell Grant dollars their GI bill dollars their federal [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  Financial aid and delivering very low quality education [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=286.64s)]
*  Hey, John, I want to ask you about something that I think is probably becoming more and more prevalent which is [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=290.79999999999995s)]
*  Students and I'm talking about you know not K [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=296.96s)]
*  But you know in there what I don't know how when they start but all the way through university and post grads are using AI [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=299.47999999999996s)]
*  a lot more [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=306.12s)]
*  I'm just wondering how do you as a you know university? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=308.12s)]
*  leader [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  Deal with that. It's becoming prevalent in a lot of cases [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  Yes, I mean the good news is there's potential for research around AI to help us get to better treatments for [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=319.68s)]
*  disease better strategies to deal with the consequences of climate change to improve things like advanced manufacturing and we have students and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=326.88s)]
*  Faculty who are working on those things all across the country, but then there's a question of AI's influence in the classroom [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=335.36s)]
*  many campuses including ours have [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=342.72s)]
*  Faculty committees that are looking at how do you make sure that AI is used helpfully in the classroom and not? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=345.52s)]
*  Taking students away from learning [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=351.84s)]
*  And this is a place maybe for bipartisan work going forward [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=354.96s)]
*  It's good that the administration wants to see investments in AI research and helping [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=359.04s)]
*  Faculty use AI to help students learn successfully that may be a place for collaboration [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=365.28s)]
*  to you as a I mean to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=371.88s)]
*  Faculty can you identify AI use but anyway, that's that's that's a tough long-winded [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=375.0s)]
*  Answer I'm sure because it's just new technology. It's affecting all of us [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=381.64000000000004s)]
*  It is complicated one thing that we're trying to do is make sure that faculty are helping students see where AI could be a useful tool [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  So one of the things you want to do with AI is you want to have a good prompt you want to ask a question [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=391.72s)]
*  That really helps the AI target the information you're seeking [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=396.24s)]
*  That could be a useful skill that students might develop might help them in their future careers [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=399.7s)]
*  What you don't want is students relying on AI to do their work for them [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=404.98s)]
*  And so you be thoughtful about assignments that require students to present it will require students to maybe do some of their writing in class [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=408.58s)]
*  Students to share the the progress that they're making on a paper over time so you can see that it's really their work [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=418.06s)]
*  Circe John King June so it's a pleasure to see you. I thank you for your time [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=425.9s)]
*  You [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ddlq8XA_Pk&t=429.62s)]
