# 'Not really very populist': Trump's doll obsession reveals the reality of his economy
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc)
*  Because I want to take a look not just at what this administration says, but how it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=0.0s)]
*  operates. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  Yes, over the past few days, Donald Trump has made headlines with an AI image of himself [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  as the pope, grand ideas for rebuilding and opening Alcatraz and slapping tariffs on foreign [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=10.52s)]
*  films. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=16.12s)]
*  But I do not want those stories to distract us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=17.12s)]
*  And instead, I want to take a moment to look at the stories that Donald Trump is not talking [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=20.28s)]
*  about. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=24.92s)]
*  Last week, a United Arab Emirates state-backed investment firm put $2 billion in one of Donald [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=26.48s)]
*  Trump's cryptocurrencies. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=33.36s)]
*  The deal was announced by Zach Witkoff. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  You recognize that name? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=37.800000000000004s)]
*  He's the co-founder of the Trump family crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=38.800000000000004s)]
*  But he is also the son of Trump's longtime friend and special Middle East envoy, Steve [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=43.24s)]
*  Witkoff. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=49.92s)]
*  You know, the guy who's been negotiating with Putin? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=50.92s)]
*  Also on the stage when they made that announcement, Eric Trump. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=53.52s)]
*  This deal would be a massive windfall for World Liberty Financial, which, as the New [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=56.900000000000006s)]
*  York Times has reported, is largely owned by a Trump family corporate entity. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=61.32s)]
*  And on that very same day, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. is considering easing restrictions [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=66.28s)]
*  on Nvidia selling chips, guess where, to the UAE. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=72.88s)]
*  This would be a huge win for that country. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=77.28s)]
*  This progress on AI has been limited by the Biden administration's rules on chips. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=79.6s)]
*  And now Donald Trump is set to visit the UAE as part of his Middle East trip. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=84.64s)]
*  Guess when? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  Next week. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  And here's another story that I'm guessing you missed, wasn't on your radar, but let's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  put it there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=94.16s)]
*  An international trucking logistics company just bought 20 million of Trump's crypto coins. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=95.32s)]
*  Maybe they're not trying to buy influence on trade policy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=102.91999999999999s)]
*  Maybe they are. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=105.72s)]
*  But my question is, why exactly would a trucking company roll the dice on a meme coin that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=106.92s)]
*  just happens to benefit the President of the United States? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=114.12s)]
*  It is reports like this that have us asking over and over, is this White House for sale? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=117.52s)]
*  Well let's bring in some folks who might know the answer to that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=124.28s)]
*  Our lead-off panel, Luke Broadwater is here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=126.64s)]
*  Pulitzer Prize-winning White House correspondent for the New York Times. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  Susan Glasser joins us. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=131.7s)]
*  David Drucker, senior writer at The Dispatch. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=132.88s)]
*  David, you recently told us that you pay attention to what Donald Trump does instead of what [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=137.28s)]
*  he says. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=143.12s)]
*  So let's take a look at these two series. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  He's talking about imposing tariffs on the movie industry. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=146.32s)]
*  He's talking about Alcatraz. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=149.56s)]
*  But what he is doing on the crypto side, possibly easing up on the UAE just as a UAE state-backed [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=151.84s)]
*  investment firm is putting billions of dollars in his cryptocurrency. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=159.92s)]
*  What's your take on that? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=163.32s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump is very transactional. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  Most things he doesn't really believe in one way or the other, so he looks at what benefits [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=168.72s)]
*  him. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, his concerns about the border and his love of tariffs are two exceptions. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  But if we remember from the first term, he was very suspicious of crypto and directed [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=179.04s)]
*  his administration to treat the currency like that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=185.18s)]
*  And this time around, it's been a completely different story. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=189.52s)]
*  Part of that are the tech donors that came to support him in his third presidential run. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  He realized how important this was to a group of voters, including a lot of younger male [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=199.94s)]
*  voters who really look at cryptos as a way around the system. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to interrupt for one second. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=211.36s)]
*  Because this is not about young male voters. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  This is not tech companies. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=215.34s)]
*  Donald Trump's family, his sons, they're raking in millions and millions of dollars. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=217.08s)]
*  So this isn't about young male voters. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=222.72s)]
*  This is about Donald Trump getting filthy rich. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=224.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=226.84s)]
*  And that's the other part of the story. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=227.88000000000002s)]
*  But my point is that when we talk about what he says and what he does, it's important to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  understand that there's not much that he believes in. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=236.68s)]
*  So he changes his mind on a whim, both for what's good politically for him and what's [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=238.68s)]
*  good for his pocketbook. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=243.56s)]
*  And I think what we've seen in this term, which is what we didn't really see in the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=244.8s)]
*  first term, at least not blatantly, is that he has had no qualms about enriching himself [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=248.88000000000002s)]
*  and using the presidency to do so. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=257.64s)]
*  It's something that wasn't there in the first four years, although people were looking for [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=260.26s)]
*  it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=265.44s)]
*  And this time around, he's very open about it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=266.44s)]
*  He doesn't try and hide it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=267.44s)]
*  And voters have treated it like it's part of the price of admission for him. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=270.68s)]
*  They don't necessarily like it, but it doesn't get the kind of billing that it would get [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=275.08s)]
*  with, let's say, a Joe Biden or any other president who comes into office being against [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=279.96s)]
*  it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=286.12s)]
*  And so if anything crops up, it's a much bigger story. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=287.12s)]
*  Luke, let's talk about Donald Trump and all the business, because he has said, we are [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  going to see deals, deals, deals. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  I think he said there's already been 200 million deals. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  It was Howard Lutnick that said 90 day pause. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=298.64s)]
*  We're going to have 90 deals in 90 days. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=301.24s)]
*  But I actually heard Howard Lutnick, the Commerce Secretary, say on TV today, people are going [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  to need to be patient when it comes to these trade deals. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=308.52s)]
*  What have you heard? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the trade deals are not happening at the pace that, frankly, they need to if we're [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  going to avoid some pretty bad results for the economy. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=318.84s)]
*  When Trump said he has already signed or done 200 trade deals, he I don't know what he was [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=325.48s)]
*  talking about, but I was told later that what he meant was him issuing the tariffs were [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=331.76s)]
*  the trade deals. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=337.16s)]
*  I don't know in whose estimation that makes sense as a trade deal. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=338.16s)]
*  But that's what he I'm told was what he was talking about was just him simply issuing [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=342.92s)]
*  the tariffs is is a trade deal. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=347.92s)]
*  Not a single one has been signed. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=351.72s)]
*  There's lots of meetings and lots of calls all the time. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=354.72s)]
*  But weeks and weeks have gone by now. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=357.52s)]
*  And and we're still waiting. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=360.52s)]
*  When are the trade deals going to be signed? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=362.44s)]
*  Everyone says, oh, it's the next week and the next week and the next week. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=365.04s)]
*  But we aren't seeing a lot of results in terms of actual trade deals being signed. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=368.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=372.72s)]
*  Well, let's talk about the new chapter in the trade war. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=373.72s)]
*  Susan posing proposing tariffs on foreign films. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=376.04s)]
*  It sounds like actor John Voight might have had a hand in this. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=380.08s)]
*  What does this say to the world? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=383.76000000000005s)]
*  Because we want to make it clear. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=384.76000000000005s)]
*  The United States is the mega dominant force, a hundred billion dollar movie business, and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  we distribute our movies around the world at a much greater scale than anyone else. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=393.20000000000005s)]
*  So what's going on here? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=398.44000000000005s)]
*  You know, Steph, I think part of the problem is that we're wired to treat major trade announcements [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=400.72s)]
*  like this as if they are serious policy decrees. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=407.36s)]
*  But in this particular case, I think what it underscores more than anything is that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=410.56s)]
*  the United States has gone from being a rule of law country to a country in which a single [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=414.52000000000004s)]
*  man can tweet from his personal mansion late at night, a decision that involves businesses [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=419.36s)]
*  that have global reach, that have hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=428.76s)]
*  dollars on the line, having gone through no known policy process, having made no rational [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=433.48s)]
*  economic sense. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, this is almost the exact opposite of the kind of technocratic policy oriented [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=441.76s)]
*  trade deliberations that we're supposed to be having that involve multiple branches of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=449.44s)]
*  our government. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=454.2s)]
*  You know, we still have a Congress, even if it doesn't do its job. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=454.8s)]
*  And, you know, for me, I think it underscores that's the through line between what you [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=457.96s)]
*  started with on this question of the president's personal enrichment, using the presidency [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=462.4s)]
*  to get additional resources for himself and his sons and the connection between that and [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=468.52s)]
*  this disruptive global trade policy. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=474.44s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump has put himself in the center of it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=477.56s)]
*  If you're a country or a corporation or someone who looks to do business with the United [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=480.59999999999997s)]
*  States, you have to come through the Oval Office now in an unprecedented way. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=486.79999999999995s)]
*  That offers the opportunities for him and his family to engage in personal business [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=491.35999999999996s)]
*  deals. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=496.08s)]
*  It offers opportunities for countries like the UAE to offer special enticements to get [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=496.6s)]
*  their own preferred business outcomes. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=503.0s)]
*  It's a radical change in the way the presidency is conducted and the aggrandizement of [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=505.44s)]
*  executive power that goes along with it is also the way for Donald Trump not only to [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=511.32s)]
*  have more power, but also potentially to enrich himself and his family. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=516.44s)]
*  Well, Luke, the president said he'll call CEOs when he disagrees with their business [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=520.8s)]
*  decisions. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=525.12s)]
*  We saw him do it last week calling Jeff Bezos about listing the tariff price increases [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=525.68s)]
*  on their website. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=530.5999999999999s)]
*  But won't his ability to do that run out? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=531.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=534.52s)]
*  If it's a few weeks from now and stores have empty shelves or small businesses are forced [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=534.76s)]
*  to have price increases. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=540.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, today alone, we saw a toy business, we saw a car manufacturer pull guidance and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=542.16s)]
*  say we cannot give Wall Street guidance of where we're going because we don't know. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=547.3599999999999s)]
*  We're starting to see signs that Trump can't just pick up the phone and tell a CEO what [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=553.12s)]
*  to do, especially when the bottom line is being impacted. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=557.0s)]
*  Yes, but I think that Susan's right when she draws the through line between all these [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=561.1999999999999s)]
*  stories and that is that, you know, Trump wants to be at the center of all this stuff, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=565.52s)]
*  right? He wants to be the person that everyone needs and that gives him more and more [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=571.28s)]
*  power. And I mean, look, just tonight, you know, where there's a big fundraiser for [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=575.96s)]
*  MAGA Inc. one point five million dollars ahead. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=580.36s)]
*  And it's the crypto. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=585.0s)]
*  It's the I'm sorry. It's the crypto companies that are there giving money to Donald Trump. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=586.28s)]
*  So to Donald Trump's pack. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=592.08s)]
*  So the you know, the trips overseas coming up to the Middle East, the the personal crypto [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=594.64s)]
*  businesses of the Trump sons, this is all connected. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=604.12s)]
*  And I think the tariffs tie into it as well. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq-5mcxLPxc&t=608.08s)]
