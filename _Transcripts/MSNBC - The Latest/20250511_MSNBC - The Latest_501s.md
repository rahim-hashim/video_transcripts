# Dr. Ibram X. Kendi's new book details how Malcolm X tried to 'bring together the Black world'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q)
*  Later this month we will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Malcolm Little, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=0.0s)]
*  also known as El-Hajmah Lig El-Shabazz or Malcolm X. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=7.36s)]
*  The Civil Rights Leader We Lost Too Soon is the subject of a new book by my next guest, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=12.44s)]
*  Dr. Ibram X. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=20.2s)]
*  Kendi. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=22.72s)]
*  Dr. Kendi, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=23.72s)]
*  The book is called Malcolm Lives, the official biography of Malcolm X for young readers, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=28.76s)]
*  and it comes out this Tuesday, May 13th. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=34.56s)]
*  Why did you feel this was a book that needed to be written for a young generation today? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=37.36s)]
*  Well, there are a lot of people around the world who read the autobiography of Malcolm [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=43.84s)]
*  X when they were in high school or college or even older. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  I was in elementary school when it came out, I remember reading it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=52.96s)]
*  Yeah, and it really transformed them. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=56.0s)]
*  It allowed them to really see racism squarely. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=58.6s)]
*  It allowed them to see how they can combat racism. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  So why can't our young people be learning about Brother Malcolm when they're in elementary [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=66.12s)]
*  school or even middle school and they become transformed then? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  That was one of the reasons why I wanted to do this book. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=75.04s)]
*  Now you write about the one and only meeting between Dr. Martin Luther King and Malcolm [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=77.92s)]
*  in 1964. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=84.16s)]
*  And America has sanitized King's legacy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=86.6s)]
*  Me coming out of the King movement, I feel they've sanitized it too much, but that's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  my opinion. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=94.55999999999999s)]
*  But it still portrays Malcolm, who championed self-defense as a militant, a scary one, contrasting [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=96.08s)]
*  Dr. King. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=103.32s)]
*  I was 10 years old when Malcolm was assassinated. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=104.32s)]
*  I was 12 or 13 when Martin was assassinated. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=107.63999999999999s)]
*  But I grew up very close to their widows, Dr. Betty Shabazz and Coretta Scott King. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=111.76s)]
*  Dr. Shabazz was the godmother of my two daughters. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=116.84s)]
*  How does the book unpack some of the myths around King's legacy, I mean around Malcolm's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  legacy? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=125.68s)]
*  Well, as a biographer, I wanted to tell the truth, the complicated and even complex truth, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=126.68s)]
*  obviously in an age-appropriate way. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=134.52s)]
*  And so I think young people learn that Malcolm was about self-defense. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=136.94s)]
*  He wasn't this violent militant who was trying to raise armies. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=141.0s)]
*  They find that he had an ideological evolution. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=145.88s)]
*  After he came back from Mecca, he spoke about all people as being racially equal and of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=148.16s)]
*  course was really focused on elevating the struggle for civil rights to human rights. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=155.44s)]
*  And so I show his story in all of its fullness. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=160.28s)]
*  Now you worked with Malcolm X estate on the novel, on this novel, and included some amazing [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=163.88s)]
*  primary sources such as pictures and letters that Malcolm typed out himself. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=170.12s)]
*  They tell the story of his journey from ex-con to leader of a movement. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=176.44s)]
*  What do you want young readers to take away from that? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=181.68s)]
*  That they can transform this world. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=185.0s)]
*  That no matter what station that they're in, you know, Malcolm suffered his father being [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=187.76s)]
*  killed, his mother being taken away, detention homes, poverty, hunger, incarceration, but [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=192.8s)]
*  he still became one of the greatest American revolutionaries in history, transformed the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=199.0s)]
*  world. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  We're still talking about him. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  So every young people, no matter who they are, where they are, they can still become [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=207.32s)]
*  somebody who's going to greatly influence this world. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=211.88s)]
*  My mother used to tell me his mother's day is not where you come from, it's where you're [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  going. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=218.32s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=219.32s)]
*  Malcolm was 39 when he was killed, right as he was transforming his stances and ideology. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=220.32s)]
*  What did we miss out on? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=227.08s)]
*  What was lost if we never saw Malcolm at 40? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  We never saw Dr. King at 40. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  He got killed at 39. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=234.4s)]
*  Medgar Evers at 39. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  But since you're focusing on this book, Malcolm at 39, what do you think we lost if Malcolm [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=237.8s)]
*  had lived to an older age? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=243.58s)]
*  Well, as you know, one of his last campaigns was to get the United States before the United [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=245.44s)]
*  States nations being charged with violating the human rights of African Americans. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=253.44s)]
*  And the way he went about doing that was really trying to bring together the black world, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=258.96s)]
*  trying to ensure that African Americans and continental Africans saw themselves as one [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=264.08s)]
*  people who are commonly subjected to global white supremacy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=270.24s)]
*  He wasn't able to ultimately achieve that, but if he lived, there could actually be more [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=273.92s)]
*  unity throughout the black world if he would have lived. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=279.56s)]
*  Now, I want to get your take on Trump's firing of congressional librarian, Dr. Carla Hayden, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=283.32s)]
*  appointed by President Obama. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=290.56s)]
*  She was the first woman, the first black person, and the first librarian who did not get a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=291.96s)]
*  lifetime appointment to run the Library of Congress. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=298.04s)]
*  There was only one year left on her 10-year term, but conservatives recently accused her [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=301.28s)]
*  of pushing so-called radical children's books. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=308.44s)]
*  As the author of a book for young adults, I'm sure many conservatives will object to, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=312.4s)]
*  what are your thoughts about the way they've targeted books and education in their culture wars? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=317.88s)]
*  Well, it's to me one of the most tragic aspects of these last few years, the ways in which [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=323.4s)]
*  these people have sought to really remove books, remove history, remove knowledge, remove [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=330.64s)]
*  truth from our young people. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=338.12s)]
*  What else should they be doing other than learning knowledge and truth and history? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  And so to me as an educator, as a scholar, it's been deeply tragic. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  You're one of the celebrated scholars, authors in the country. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  What is your next project after this? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, I'm trying to figure that out right now, but I'm really excited to celebrate, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  really, Malcolm's 100th birthday with Malcolm Lives. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=365.16s)]
*  And I know that Malcolm is looking down on many of the fearless activists around the world, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=370.68s)]
*  and certainly your fearlessness as we continue to resist this administration [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=376.6s)]
*  and anyone who's trying to subject us. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=381.52s)]
*  One of the things that, as I said, I came out of a different school of thought, but [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=383.56s)]
*  getting to have a relationship with Dr. Betty Shabazz meant a lot to me. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=387.68s)]
*  She spoke in National Action Network. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=392.4s)]
*  That's speaking at one of our Saturday morning rallies that I'm showing. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=394.36s)]
*  One of the things that she said is that she always wished that a broader audience [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  saw what Malcolm was about. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=405.44s)]
*  What do you want our white viewers to do and think about Malcolm and young whites to read? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=407.96s)]
*  Why is it important for everybody to understand what Malcolm X was about? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, as I mentioned, Malcolm died advocating for human rights, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=419.67999999999995s)]
*  and he recognized that white people were human too. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=425.8s)]
*  He recognized that white people too were being deprived of their rights. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=429.15999999999997s)]
*  And particularly in this moment, it doesn't really matter whether you're black or white or Latino or Asian. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  Our civil liberties, our human rights are under attack by this administration. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=440.68s)]
*  And so I think every white American, really every American who's serious about ensuring that we have a democracy [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=445.68s)]
*  and that we are all protected in our rights as human beings should recognize and really admire [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=453.48s)]
*  Malcolm X's courage and his fearlessness to speak to that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=459.2s)]
*  The book is called Malcolm Lives, the official biography of Malcolm X for young readers. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=462.8s)]
*  It is out on Tuesday. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=468.96s)]
*  Many thanks to author Ibram X. Kendi. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FjqNP8v0Q&t=471.04s)]
