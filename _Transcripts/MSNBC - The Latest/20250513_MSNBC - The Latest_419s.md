# 'How many dead Palestinians are needed?': Professor reacts to crisis in Gaza
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI)
*  I want to bring in Rabbi Rick Jacob, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, which is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=0.0s)]
*  the largest denomination of Judaism in North America. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=5.0200000000000005s)]
*  Also joining us, MSNBC political analyst and Princeton University Professor Eddie Glaude. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=9.02s)]
*  Thank you both for being here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Rabbi, what compelled you to write this now? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=15.5s)]
*  To be honest, for two months, obviously, it has been just hard to imagine the suffering. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=18.82s)]
*  I wanted also to be clear that Hamas is the entity most responsible for sacrificing the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=26.62s)]
*  well-being of the Palestinian people. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=32.94s)]
*  And yet Israel has a moral code that says that there are certain things that must not [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=35.260000000000005s)]
*  be done, not in war, not in peacetime, never. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=40.900000000000006s)]
*  And to use as a deliberate strategy the withholding of food and water for civilians, particularly [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of children, is just beyond the pale of what a country built on [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=53.02s)]
*  the foundations of Judaism should be doing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=58.7s)]
*  The Jewish tradition is very clear. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=61.260000000000005s)]
*  In the book of Deuteronomy, it says, even when you're waging war, you may not destroy [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=62.78s)]
*  the fruit-bearing trees. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=67.30000000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=68.82000000000001s)]
*  Because those are trees that will feed generations to come. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=69.82000000000001s)]
*  And you have to always be thinking not only about this moment, but the implications of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=73.02000000000001s)]
*  one's act, even in a time of war. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=77.30000000000001s)]
*  So I felt compelled to raise my voice. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  I have many times throughout the last 18 months, but this felt like a very dire moment. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=81.7s)]
*  You heard that nurse rabbi call what she sees a horror movie. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=88.14s)]
*  Those children she's trying to save, obviously, are not Hamas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=92.92s)]
*  I know you're not a politician, but do you see a path forward to security without innocent [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=96.42s)]
*  people in the crosshairs? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=101.98s)]
*  I am a person of faith, and I believe there must be a different way forward. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=104.7s)]
*  I'm not counting on Hamas. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=109.7s)]
*  Any money who does, I think, is not paying attention. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  I do, however, expect that the international bodies, including the United States of America, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=114.22s)]
*  which has a very clear interest in seeing some of the resolution of what is unfolding [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=120.62s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=125.94s)]
*  And so it's obviously the question of food and water, but it's also what's happening [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=126.94s)]
*  to the civilians. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=132.82s)]
*  What will be the day after? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=133.9s)]
*  To have the decision to move Palestinians to the south of Israel and to free up the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=135.98s)]
*  north potentially for increased settlements is not the solution that we need. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=141.98s)]
*  But the first and most urgent moral problem is to feed those who are hungry. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=147.17999999999998s)]
*  And yes, they are not Hamas. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=151.98s)]
*  Are they supportive of Hamas? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  On some level, it does not matter. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=155.54s)]
*  Children are children, and they must have access to food and water. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=158.26s)]
*  That is a moral imperative. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=162.82s)]
*  And I feel that this is a moment where there has to be other ways to get to the future [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=164.9s)]
*  that we need. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=170.06s)]
*  Eddie, a UN spokesperson on Monday did not mince words, and I'm going to quote here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=171.06s)]
*  This is not a natural disaster, but a human-made catastrophe that the world should not allow. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  We have seen pictures, images of children, even today, carrying all their belongings [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=183.54000000000002s)]
*  through the rubble, a tiny baby in a rainbow jumper that was killed by an airstrike. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=187.78000000000003s)]
*  And then there was a child. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  This is today with one leg waiting on crutches just to try to get a bit of food. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=194.84s)]
*  These images are so heartbreaking, so chilling. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=200.88s)]
*  They raise the question, Hamas, yes, Hamas is responsible. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=204.08s)]
*  Israel has made a decision for the blockade. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=208.8s)]
*  But what is the responsibility of other governments? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=211.6s)]
*  What is the responsibility of us all when children and innocents are starving to death? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=215.36s)]
*  You know, it's a difficult question on a certain level and an easy answer on another. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=222.67999999999998s)]
*  First, I think countries across the world need to just simply live up to international law. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=228.39999999999998s)]
*  What Israel is doing in relation to Gaza, the blockade that is cutting off food and water, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=234.12s)]
*  is illegal. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=239.72s)]
*  It's not sanctioned by international law. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=240.72s)]
*  And I think if countries understand that and live up to the letter of that law and to the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  intent of that law, they would hold Israel accountable. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=248.96s)]
*  I want to just acknowledge what the rabbi is doing, what he's written and what he's doing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=251.72s)]
*  It is important that when you're within a particular tradition, Chris, that you can [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  bring the resources of that tradition to bear on the actions of those who are committed [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=261.08s)]
*  to the same principles and ideals and faith that you are. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=265.24s)]
*  So it's within that tradition that he's bringing the basic tenets of Judaism to bear on what [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=269.3s)]
*  Israel is doing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=274.76s)]
*  And I think that's really important and I think it's powerful. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=275.76s)]
*  And I understand the risk that he's taken. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=278.32s)]
*  I think also for me, I just want to say, I want to ask a basic question. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=281.4s)]
*  How many dead Palestinians are needed for the state of Israel? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=285.88s)]
*  What level of mass death is required to satiate your revenge? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=292.34s)]
*  To feel safe? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=298.36s)]
*  How many dead babies and children? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=300.44s)]
*  We have to ask that moral question as we bear witness to what we're seeing, Chris. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=302.28s)]
*  Eddie, I want to ask you very briefly one other question that is an ethical question. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=308.0s)]
*  The Trump administration welcoming white South Africaners to the U.S. as refugees while denying [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=314.28s)]
*  virtually all other groups fleeing war or persecution. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=320.67999999999995s)]
*  The Episcopal Church's migration service is now refusing a federal directive to help [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=324.58s)]
*  resettle them. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=329.68s)]
*  The presiding bishop said this. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=330.88s)]
*  It has been painful to watch one group of refugees selected in a highly unusual manner [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  receive preferential treatment over many others who have been waiting in refugee camps or [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=338.96s)]
*  dangerous conditions for years. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=343.12s)]
*  Does this move show who the administration sees as worthy? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=347.08s)]
*  What do you see in that decision? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=352.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=354.52s)]
*  Donald Trump and his minions have been arguing for over the last decade or so that the demographic [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=356.0s)]
*  shifts in the country pose an existential threat to America. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  They feel like they're losing their country. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  And so I think what we see very clearly here, Chris, is a white nationalist agenda at work. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  And we need to call it for what it is. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=375.68s)]
*  I want to just echo what Eddie said, Rabbi. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  It is, I believe, incumbent on religious leaders to speak truth. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=384.1s)]
*  And you have done that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=390.46000000000004s)]
*  And I know it can't have been easy. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=391.46000000000004s)]
*  So thank you and thank you for coming on the program, Eddie. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=393.3s)]
*  It's always just a pleasure and an honor to have you as well. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=395.82000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwc-mX8tRI&t=414.1s)]
