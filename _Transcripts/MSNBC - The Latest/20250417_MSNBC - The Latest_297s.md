# 'Shocking': Reagan judge issues ‘stark warning’ in scathing ruling against Trump
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI)
*  The whole point of having due process in this country and really any country is so that you can find out what the truth is, right? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=0.0s)]
*  There's lots of allegations against Kilmar or Briego Garcia. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=8.0s)]
*  The Trump administration has called him a gang member, a terrorist, and a human trafficker. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=11.0s)]
*  Those are serious things to say about someone. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=16.0s)]
*  Yesterday, the DOJ released this trove of documents intending to show that the man is an MS-13 gang member, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=18.0s)]
*  including something called a Gang Field Interview Sheet that was put together in 2019 from the Prince George's County Police Department of Maryland. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=25.0s)]
*  The report alleges that during a 2019 interview with police, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=32.0s)]
*  a Briego Garcia was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie with rolls of money covering the eyes, ears, and mouth of the presidents on the separate denominations. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=35.0s)]
*  Officers know such clothing to be indicative of Hispanic gang culture. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=43.0s)]
*  The report also says officers spoke to a quote, reliable source of information who advised a Briego Garcia is an active member of MS-13. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=47.0s)]
*  Today, Prince George's County Police Department released a statement confirming that a Briego Garcia was never charged with a crime. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=54.0s)]
*  They also confirmed that one of the officers who put together that Gang Field Interview Sheet pleaded guilty to misconduct in office in an unrelated case and was fired in 2022. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=62.0s)]
*  Now, a Briego Garcia's lawyers and family say he is not a gang member, and we know that he has no criminal record. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=71.0s)]
*  But of course, none of these allegations against a Briego Garcia are definitive one way or the other. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=78.0s)]
*  The whole point of hundreds of years of legal tradition we are inheritors to is that there is a process to establish these contested facts. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=85.0s)]
*  They could have just held an immigration hearing, as Judge J. Harvey Wilkinson, the legendary conservative Reagan appointee on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=96.0s)]
*  noted in a remarkable ruling today, one that thunders with righteous indignation from a jurist long admired on the right, Wilkinson writes, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=105.0s)]
*  quote, the government asserts that a Briego Garcia is a terrorist and a member of MS-13. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=113.0s)]
*  Perhaps, perhaps not. Regardless, he is still entitled to due process. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=117.0s)]
*  If the government is confident of its position, it should be assured that position will prevail in proceedings to terminate the withholding of removal order. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=123.0s)]
*  That was the order that was in place to stop him from being deported to El Salvador. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=131.0s)]
*  So in other words, if you guys are so certain he's guilty, it should be easy to prove. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=136.0s)]
*  In fact, the standard that would pertain here would be a preponderance of the evidence, not even beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=141.0s)]
*  That portion, I read you, was part of the larger decision today in which the Fourth Circuit rejected efforts by the Trump DOJ to short circuit the lower court's order [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=149.0s)]
*  to facilitate a Briego Garcia's return from that prison in El Salvador. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=160.0s)]
*  Judge Wilkinson also included a stark warning, quote, it is difficult in some cases to get to the very heart of the matter. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=165.0s)]
*  But in this case, it is not hard at all. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=171.0s)]
*  The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=173.0s)]
*  Further, it claims in essence that because it is rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=184.0s)]
*  This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=191.0s)]
*  Asher Agapa is a former FBI special agent, now an assistant dean at the Yale Jackson School of Global Affairs. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=200.0s)]
*  She joins me now. Good to have you here. Thanks. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=205.0s)]
*  This was a seven page, I guess, opinion order issued by the Fourth Circuit authored by Wilkinson. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=208.0s)]
*  It really sort of put me back in my chair. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=216.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think when he says it's very simple to get to the heart of the matter, you know, there aren't many silver linings in this Briego Garcia situation. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=219.0s)]
*  But we do have the fact that we've gone from zero to Pinochet in 100 days. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=228.0s)]
*  And it's pretty clear where we are. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=233.0s)]
*  When I teach habeas corpus in my national security law class, I use as sort of the hyperbolic example habeas corpus is what stands between you and the president grabbing you in the middle of the night and throwing you throwing you into a foreign gulag. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=236.0s)]
*  And that's not hyperbolic anymore. That is what is happening. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=250.0s)]
*  It's such a foundational right that it is the right that is expressly forbidden from being suspended in the Constitution. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=253.0s)]
*  And it's in Article one because the framers knew that if you gave that power to the president, you might have a lot of invasions and rebellions to justify it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=261.0s)]
*  So the fact that this is happening, that the Trump administration has washed its hands of a Briego Garcia. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=269.0s)]
*  You [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfDwffBUnI&t=291.0s)]
