# ‘My survival instincts kicked in’: FSU student describes evacuation during shooting
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA)
*  Let me bring in Ryan Cedergren who was in the Student Union when all of this unfolded. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=0.0s)]
*  First of all Ryan, how are you? Are you okay? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=6.08s)]
*  I am okay, thank you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=9.56s)]
*  Tell me about what happened. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=11.92s)]
*  Yeah, so I was in the bowling alley which is in the lowest level of the Student Union [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=13.6s)]
*  and next door to us is a bar and the bar is open to the entire union like it's, there's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  no doors or anything. The bowling alley has doors and so all of a sudden we see everyone [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=26.16s)]
*  from the bar start running and then in that moment we're just like confused, we're unsure [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  of what's going on and so we just decided it was best to go seek shelter. First we went [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=42.08s)]
*  to a spot that still had glass and where we could see the door and then we're like we [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=49.36s)]
*  probably need to move. Once we saw the police in the lowest level that was when we decided to move [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=55.52s)]
*  to a better, more secure area. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  Did you at any point hear shooting? When did you realize that this was the situation that we now [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  know it was? I did not hear any shots at all and it was probably within a minute that we realized [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=72.56s)]
*  what was going on. Unfortunately, I've grown up in this era to where school shootings and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=82.8s)]
*  campus shootings are not commonplace but we've practiced for it, we've trained for it, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  we know what's going on and that was our first instinct and in this era news travels so quickly [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=96.08s)]
*  and rumors travel so quickly that within minutes we all kind of had an idea of what was going on [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=108.32s)]
*  upstairs. So you talk about the fact that you moved first to an area that had glass then you [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  saw police, you moved into a more secure location. At what point then did you move to where you are [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=122.96s)]
*  now or are you still in that secure location? Yeah, so we waited, it was probably about 10 minutes [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=131.04s)]
*  until FSC police came and got us and once they came and got us they escorted us out of the building [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=137.92s)]
*  to a green space around the union and that was where I saw some people getting EMS detention, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=148.0s)]
*  there was police everywhere, fire everywhere, medical response everywhere and then from there [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=156.32s)]
*  they kind of held us to make sure everyone was okay and then found us, you know, go this way out [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=163.36s)]
*  of campus and stay off campus and I took like the longest route back to my apartment. You sound very [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  calm, you talk about the fact that you have had training but did you feel calm in responding to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=178.16s)]
*  what you say had become instinct having been trained for a situation like this and the obvious [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=186.0s)]
*  question Ryan, did you ever think in spite of all that training this would ever happen to you? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=191.36s)]
*  You know, I was calm, I feel like there were people that were sheltering with us that were [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=198.96s)]
*  hyperventilating, having panic attacks, stressing out and I was just kind of like, you know, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=207.84s)]
*  I have trust in the police department, I know they train for it, I know, you know, if it came to it, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=214.16s)]
*  you know, we would fight if we had to but I, you know, being in the center part of campus I knew [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=221.6s)]
*  police was going to be on scene very, very quickly and so, you know, I just, you know, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=228.24s)]
*  kind of said a quick prayer and then, you know, just tried to stay as calm as possible and then [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=236.72s)]
*  I'm sorry, what was the other question towards then? Well, I just wondered at that moment the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=244.72s)]
*  instinct that sort of, you know, kicked in, maybe that was part of your feeling calm, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=249.68s)]
*  you felt you knew what you had to do? Yeah, I think that was definitely part of it is I knew [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=257.92s)]
*  what I had to do, I knew how to protect myself and I knew how to, you know, what I'd have to do if I, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=263.76s)]
*  you know, if it ever came to it but I think that's part of it. When you say came to it, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=269.92s)]
*  if you came face to face with a shooter? I mean, I just have had a lot of trust that the police [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=274.32s)]
*  was going to be on scene so quickly and so I, you know, went as quick as, you know, possible to hide [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  and then, you know, you talk, I talk about, you know, I try to be calm in the room because, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=292.32s)]
*  you know, I'm someone that is going to be going into news eventually as a career and I'm like, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=298.16s)]
*  you know, there's the rumors flying all over social media about what's going on and it's like, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=303.12s)]
*  okay, so let's know what we know and know that, you know, we need to be safe and, you know, just, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=308.0s)]
*  you know, know that, you know, we're going to all huddle in together, there were about 40 of us [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=314.0s)]
*  and, you know, we'll be safe. You mentioned earlier about how quickly news and in fact, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  also rumors travel. How quickly were you able to get in touch with your family, your friends, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=327.52s)]
*  make sure everyone's safe and allow your people who care about you to know that you were safe? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=334.88s)]
*  Yeah, it was within minutes. It was, you know, within minutes everyone was, my phone is still [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=341.2s)]
*  blowing up. Everyone is, you know, texting, calling, but, you know, like you said, there have been [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=346.32s)]
*  rumors all over the internet about what's going on and it's like, I'm just going off what the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=355.68s)]
*  university says, what news sources say and, you know, go from there because, you know, in college, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=360.24s)]
*  the rumor mode seems to fly a lot and, you know, just know what we know and, you know, I'm so [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=366.56s)]
*  grateful to FSUPD, Tallahassee police, you know, all the first responders and everyone that, you [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=372.64s)]
*  know, came and, you know, protected us in the moment we needed it. So let me ask you, given that [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=379.6s)]
*  you are going into the news business as a career, I'm particularly interested when you got out into [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=384.72s)]
*  what you called that green space and you said you saw EMS tending to people, you saw fire, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=391.12s)]
*  you saw police. Observationally, what struck you? Are there any details that you can share with us [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  about what you saw? Yeah, it was about 15 minutes after the first initial, maybe 10, 15 minutes. It [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=402.16s)]
*  really didn't feel that long of a time and once we got outside, we were escorted out by police [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=409.36s)]
*  and we were just like, okay, you know, we're going, you know, it was, you know, we got outside, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=416.48s)]
*  there was helicopters circling, there was police everywhere, fire everywhere, and then there was [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  one person, I saw at least one person being attended to by EMS. If there was one thing you think that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  you want people to know about what you saw, what you felt, what your friends and other folks who [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=437.12s)]
*  were with you experienced, what would you want them to know? So many people, unfortunately, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=444.32s)]
*  thousands of students across the country at every level, elementary, high school, college, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=451.04s)]
*  have been through what you are going through. What would you tell them? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=457.92s)]
*  It's that the drills that you do that seem pointless are not pointless. You know, in that [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  moment, my survival instincts kicked in and my knowledge of the drill has kicked in and, you [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=471.28s)]
*  know, we knew we had to hide and, you know, make ourselves, you know, almost disappear. And then, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  you know, it's also, you know, my thankfulness to the police and to the fire and, you know, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=486.32s)]
*  they do such a great job. They, you know, go in prepared to give their lives for our lives. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=492.72s)]
*  An important series of points. Ryan Cedergren, I'm glad you're okay. We're all glad to see [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=500.96000000000004s)]
*  that you're okay. And we do thank you for sharing your story with us. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfogAQW02vA&t=506.72s)]
