Video Description: As President Trump’s first 100 days in office wrap up, MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and Jacob Soboroff spoke with forced out federal workers during the live MSNBC town hall — "100 Days of Trump: Forced Out Federal Workers."
After the town hall, both Ruhle and Soboroff stuck around to hear even more stories with forced out workers from agencies across the government including the FDA, NOAA, and NIH. "I think it's an enormous hit to the American public, and that's why I'm here," one forced out worker told Ruhle.

# 'An enormous hit to the American public': Forced out federal workers share their stories | MSNBC
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4)
*  We are here on YouTube telling some important stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=0.0s)]
*  We talk all the time about how we want to help people get better and smarter, and beyond [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=3.04s)]
*  the numbers, it's the humans. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=7.08s)]
*  It is easy to say, the government's too fat. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=8.96s)]
*  I don't know what they do for me. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=11.92s)]
*  Let's cut some budgets. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=13.96s)]
*  We're going to talk to some of the people who joined us tonight about what their jobs [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=14.96s)]
*  were, and without them in those jobs, what it means for the American people. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=18.64s)]
*  We've just finished our town hall with federal workers who were fired by the Trump administration. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  We're going to start with Sabrina. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=25.76s)]
*  Sabrina, come on up. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=26.76s)]
*  Sure thing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=27.76s)]
*  Sabrina, we didn't get a chance to hear from you while we were live on the air. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=29.0s)]
*  Tell us who you are and what you did. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  My name is Sabrina Valenti. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  I was a budget analyst at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  I managed the budget for a several hundred million dollar program that actually restores [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=39.56s)]
*  the coastline in South Louisiana. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=43.540000000000006s)]
*  This is an area that's very vulnerable to sea level rise, to any time a hurricane blows [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=45.44s)]
*  in, and I was one who made sure that money got out the door so that Louisiana could pay [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=49.32s)]
*  local businesses to come in and rebuild marshes and rebuild barrier islands to reinforce dikes [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=52.78s)]
*  and levees that hold the evacuation routes for people to get out of their small hometowns [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=58.1s)]
*  when a storm strikes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=61.74s)]
*  So not only was this mitigating impacts of the global climate emergency, but it was also [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=62.74s)]
*  stimulating the local economy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=67.14s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=68.34s)]
*  I mean, this is millions of dollars of federal money that gets injected into Louisiana's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=69.34s)]
*  economy. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=72.14s)]
*  Almost half of Louisiana's state budget, which I know because I used to work for them, relies [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=73.14s)]
*  on federal funding. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=76.78s)]
*  So without that money, you are putting a lot of Louisianans up a creek. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=77.94s)]
*  Thank you so much, Sabrina. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=81.5s)]
*  Everybody's got a story. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=82.5s)]
*  Anybody else? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=83.5s)]
*  Come on down. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=84.5s)]
*  Come on out. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=85.5s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=88.82s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=89.82s)]
*  Hi, my name is Bushra Kadeeb. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=90.82s)]
*  I was a writer editor with the National Institutes of Health. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=91.82s)]
*  I wrote about health topics and research for a general audience. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=95.02s)]
*  I was specially trained to write about scientific research in a way that was plain and accessible [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=99.66s)]
*  to the general population. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=104.66s)]
*  So what would the rationale be for why we don't need that anymore? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=107.3s)]
*  The stated reason for eliminating my entire communications team and a lot of the other [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=111.86s)]
*  communications teams at NIH was that it's redundancy and waste. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=116.1s)]
*  But really the impact of those cuts is that there will no longer be trusted health information [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=121.05999999999999s)]
*  available to American people and transparency about research will be eliminated. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=127.86s)]
*  We're so grateful to you for being here tonight. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=133.5s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=135.34s)]
*  That's life or death. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=136.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=137.62s)]
*  How do you feel? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=138.62s)]
*  I think it's an enormous hit to the American public. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=140.18s)]
*  And that's why I'm here because I feel like people need to know the story about the direct [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=143.66s)]
*  impact on public health and belief and trust of federal health agencies. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=148.34s)]
*  Are you scared? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=155.54s)]
*  I'm scared for myself. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=157.26s)]
*  I'm scared for Americans' health. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=158.7s)]
*  I'm scared for the future of research. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=161.18s)]
*  I'm scared for NIH. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=162.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=164.26s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=165.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=166.26s)]
*  Who else? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=167.26s)]
*  Who else? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=168.26s)]
*  I'm going to go to that side. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=169.26s)]
*  I feel like over in the corner it deserves a little attention. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=170.26s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=172.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm coming. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=174.5s)]
*  Here, I'm going to come over here. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=175.5s)]
*  You guys want to all talk together? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=179.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=180.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=181.74s)]
*  I'm just going to give you guys the mic. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=182.74s)]
*  You do it, you talk to us, and I'll be right back. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  You just talk right into that camera right there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=186.74s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=188.34s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=189.34s)]
*  So we are health communication specialists from the... [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=190.34s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=194.74s)]
*  A little higher. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=195.74s)]
*  We are health communication specialists from the FDA. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=196.74s)]
*  Our job was to be that point, that bridge between the public and the work that was being [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=199.28s)]
*  done at FDA. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=205.56s)]
*  So I personally worked on drugs to treat infectious disease, on antibiotics, on drug shortages, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=207.28s)]
*  and I worked with the FDA's team who responded to counterterrorism and emerging threats to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=213.76s)]
*  our nation's pharmaceutical supply. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=218.56s)]
*  And to follow up to that, one of my biggest projects was to work on fraudulent health [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=221.96s)]
*  products. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=227.28s)]
*  You see things on the market that look kind of sketchy. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=228.28s)]
*  You're not sure if you should take them. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=231.0s)]
*  You look at our website. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=233.28s)]
*  If we're able to... [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=234.88s)]
*  If we know about them, we can tell you about them. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=235.88s)]
*  And now there's no one to tell people about those things. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=238.2s)]
*  And I was pretty much the communications maven for all of controlled substances and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=241.8s)]
*  opioids, overdose, life-saving preventive care. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=247.4s)]
*  I ran the campaigns, the nationwide campaigns you may see on TV, Remove the Risk, sunscreen, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=250.96s)]
*  all of those safety. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  I ran those campaigns for Cedar and FDA. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=260.52s)]
*  So what's happening without you there? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=264.76s)]
*  They are done. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  There's nothing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  Not much. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=270.59999999999997s)]
*  And what is the rationale? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  Because just hearing what you're hearing, that certainly sounds like critical work. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=273.08s)]
*  Well, you're losing the bridge to the people. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  Our job as communicators is to make sure that you all have the pertinent information that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=279.88s)]
*  you need to have is timely, is accurate, and it's helpful. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=284.38s)]
*  If you look at the website even now, you'll notice you're not hearing much about recalls. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=288.5s)]
*  You're not hearing much about food recalls, drug recalls, safety recalls, warning letters. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=292.38s)]
*  You don't know about it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=297.94s)]
*  So if your drug's contaminated now, it's luck of the draw. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=298.94s)]
*  And one of the things our office did, we handled the public inquiries. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=305.21999999999997s)]
*  So if you were to call the FDA and ask a question about your drug, you would hit our office. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=309.14s)]
*  We answered 42,000 public inquiries last year. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=314.18s)]
*  70% of those were from the American public. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=317.62s)]
*  That team is gone. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=320.44s)]
*  And so there is nobody to serve as that point of transparency for the American people. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=322.16s)]
*  And as somebody who worked on the crisis response, Hurricane Helene, those kind of things, to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  not have anyone there ready to do that work and to tell the American people the information [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=333.42s)]
*  they need to know to keep themselves safe and to keep their families safe is very scary. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=339.56s)]
*  What explanation did they give you when they said you're done? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=344.36s)]
*  They said they were reorganizing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=347.88s)]
*  It wasn't anything to do with our performance or anything like that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=350.08s)]
*  They just were eliminating redundancies. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=354.88s)]
*  They think they can do it all at the HHS secretary level. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=356.88s)]
*  And there's no way that you can respond to the kinds of things that we did on a daily basis. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=360.66s)]
*  That's sort of my question. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=366.56s)]
*  The argument they're making, is there a through line? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  Could another agency pick this work? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=372.12s)]
*  Could they optimize it? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=374.44s)]
*  And is there another team that's not in this room right now that's doing the work and we just don't know them? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=375.44s)]
*  No, you don't have the manpower to do everything that we were doing. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=380.03999999999996s)]
*  And we were just the center for drugs. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=384.36s)]
*  The FDA regulates food. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  It's, I believe, 21 cents on the dollar for all American products. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=388.12s)]
*  And there is no one to communicate that to the American public when you need to know [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=391.56s)]
*  something to keep your family safe. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=396.76s)]
*  Why do you think they did this? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=398.91999999999996s)]
*  What you're talking about has nothing to do with politics. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  It has to do with public health safety. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=404.68s)]
*  They wanted radical transparency. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=407.96s)]
*  They got radical, but it's not transparency. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=409.64s)]
*  And the one last thing, they didn't save any money by firing us. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=412.12s)]
*  Most of FDA, especially where we were in Cedar, we were paid for by user fees. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  The pharmaceutical industry pays for us. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=419.84s)]
*  So you didn't save a dollar. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  You just got rid of the people who were tasked with communicating with the public and essentially [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=425.92s)]
*  promoting and protecting the public health, as that was the mission of FDA. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=431.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=434.40000000000003s)]

*  Who else? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=436.40000000000003s)]
*  Sir? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=437.40000000000003s)]
*  Hi, I'm Tom DiLibertto. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  I was a meteorologist and climate scientist and a public affairs specialist at NOAA, the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=442.56s)]
*  Natural Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=446.68s)]
*  So you're not in that job. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=449.2s)]
*  Tell us who the people you serve, who needed your work and who's not going to get it this [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  summer. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=456.28000000000003s)]
*  The way I would, people that know what NOAA is, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  but I always say, I can do a show of hands, who here has been outside before? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=460.36s)]
*  That's what NOAA does. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  If you've been to the beach before, that's what NOAA does. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=468.64000000000004s)]
*  We monitor this planet from the sun to the bottom of the oceans. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=471.40000000000003s)]
*  The ones who forecast the weather, we're the ones who research how climate change is changing [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  extremes. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=479.40000000000003s)]
*  We make sure coasts are safe. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=480.40000000000003s)]
*  We make sure that the fisheries industry is robust enough to maintain itself. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=481.96s)]
*  And we've seen cuts across NOAA, across every aspect of what NOAA does. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=487.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people from NOAA here. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=490.8s)]
*  Raise your hand if you worked at NOAA. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=491.96s)]
*  How many of you are scientists? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=492.96s)]
*  How many of you are communication specialists? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=496.44s)]
*  How many of you do something else that I don't know about? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=498.68s)]
*  Then let's go to the last person. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=501.28s)]
*  Who wants to tell us what is your message to the president? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=504.08s)]
*  He could be watching. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=507.32s)]
*  You're hurting the American people. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=511.88s)]
*  At the end of the day, it isn't about the people in this room. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=516.32s)]
*  It's about the people in this country and around this world who are being harmed. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=521.24s)]
*  And we are dedicated to the American people. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=528.16s)]
*  That's what we do. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=532.2s)]
*  That's what, for me, that's what my grandfather did when he worked in the Secret Service in [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=533.8s)]
*  the 50s and 60s. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=537.8s)]

*  kids, the adults, everybody. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=549.44s)]
*  And I hope he knows that because his legacy is about tearing this country and this planet [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx7-vKRsOi4&t=553.96s)]
