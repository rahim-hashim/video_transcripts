# Senate revoking California emissions rules is 'pro-polluter' and 'anti-health': AG Rob Bonta
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs)
*  Joining me now is California's Attorney General Rob Bonta. Thanks for joining us tonight, General. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=0.0s)]
*  Let me ask you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=8.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=8.56s)]
*  Let's start with education. This week the administration announced plans to aggressively [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=10.48s)]
*  revoke Chinese visas in a move that could affect as many as 50,000 students in California alone. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=15.44s)]
*  Courts have already blocked an effort to bar foreign students at Harvard. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=23.36s)]
*  What recourse does the state have in this matter? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=28.0s)]
*  Well, students have rights, the right to due process as well as the right not to be [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=34.72s)]
*  discriminated against by their government based on their viewpoint. Trump was already involved in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=39.92s)]
*  student visa revocations that he got a lot of pushback on and, you know, true to his taco Trump [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=46.32s)]
*  nickname, backed out and stopped revoking those visas, which was the appropriate thing to do in [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  the first place. So we'll evaluate what actions he takes here and our North Star is always, is it [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=61.76s)]
*  lawful, is it constitutional, are rights or freedoms being violated of Californians? And if so, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=68.08s)]
*  when California has standing, we will get involved. If individuals have the ability to go to court to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=74.32s)]
*  sue, then we are likely to get involved as a friend of the court or as an, in an amicus brief [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=81.04s)]
*  to make sure the court knows our commitment to the rule of law, the constitution, due process, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=86.4s)]
*  and the rights and freedoms of our people. Let's move to immigration. 48 California [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=92.72s)]
*  counties and dozens of cities, including Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Diego, and San Francisco, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  were among 500 total jurisdictions nationwide identified as sanctuary cities and put on notice [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=105.76s)]
*  by the department of Homeland security to change their policies to adhere with Trump's mass [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=113.04s)]
*  deportation policy. How far can this administration go to target these so-called sanctuary communities? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=119.44s)]
*  Yes, not far under the law, but they have shown a repeat offender willingness to violate the law [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=127.28s)]
*  and violate the constitution brazenly and blatantly frequently and consistently. Unfortunately, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=136.4s)]
*  we have, and by the way, this, this list is very unremarkable. It is a list of things that were [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=142.16s)]
*  already publicly known and, and well-known broadly known. We made no secret in California of our [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=148.64s)]
*  position to enforce criminal laws and focus on public safety and leave civil immigration [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  enforcement to the agencies and departments in the federal government that do that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=163.44s)]
*  And we will not obstruct or interfere with their ability and right to lawfully enforce immigration [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=167.68s)]
*  rights. But we're, we're going to focus on crime, on rape and robbery and burglary and make sure we [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=175.6s)]
*  keep communities safe. So the, there's a case right now. It's the law of the ninth circuit, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=181.28s)]
*  including, which includes California that says that our SB 54, the law that we have created [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=187.68s)]
*  that leads us to be focusing on public safety instead of civil immigration enforcement is [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=194.56s)]
*  completely constitutional and that the Trump administration would be violating the state of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=198.56s)]
*  California's 10th amendment states rights. Should he try to do what he's trying to do here, which is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=203.36s)]
*  force states and other jurisdictions to do the job of the federal government for them. They cannot [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=209.04s)]
*  commandeer, conscript and press into service and draft force other states, states and local [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=216.4s)]
*  jurisdictions to do their job for them. They can do their job. They can't, but they can't force us [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  to do it. And that is black letter 10th amendment constitutional law. On, on the matter of the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=227.44s)]
*  environment, president Trump has vowed to sign a bill passed by Senate Republicans this week [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=232.48s)]
*  that would kill California's phase out of gas fueled cars by 2035. You vowed to challenge that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=238.24s)]
*  measure if enacted. Can you talk about what's at stake here? Yeah, I mean, this is a very clear and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=246.8s)]
*  blatant effort by the Trump administration to pursue a pro polluter, anti environment, anti health, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=255.36s)]
*  anti innovation, anti California agenda and to do it unlawfully. It's not just wrong. It's unlawful. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=261.76s)]
*  The, the, the attempt that they are making the use of this congressional review act to revoke a waiver [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=268.24s)]
*  that the state of California has appropriately been granted is unlawful. It's never been done [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=275.84s)]
*  before. California has received over a hundred waivers in the last few decades. Never once [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=280.8s)]
*  ever has this authority, the congressional review act been used. And a lot is at stake. We are the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=285.2s)]
*  biggest state in the nation. We have the biggest population. We are the leaders in the nation and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=291.52s)]
*  in the world when it comes to climate action and protecting our environment, when it comes to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=296.96s)]
*  innovation and clean vehicles and making sure that we're reducing pollution so that populations [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=301.76s)]
*  and communities that have been harmed and been forced to suck in dirty air can have clean air. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=308.64s)]
*  So, and many states across the nation have followed our lead appropriately. So because they see the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  science, they know the importance of tackling climate change and making our communities healthy [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=319.92s)]
*  and safe. So a lot is at stake here and the Trump administration's actions are blatantly unlawful. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=324.88s)]
*  Don't just take my word for it. Listen to the government accountability office, the Senate [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=330.8s)]
*  parliamentarian as well, who said that the congressional review act is not an appropriate [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  tool to be used in this instance. Next week, you're joining some other democratic attorney [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  generals in Seattle to talk about the fight for democracy under Trump. We've seen throughout Trump's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=345.2s)]
*  political career that he has a unique ability to use and abuse the country's legal system. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=351.68s)]
*  As someone on the front lines pushing back on those tactics, how do you think it's going? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=359.28s)]
*  I think it's going well. We have brought 23 lawsuits now in 18 weeks, more than one a week. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  And in a majority of those cases, we are winning. We're getting injunctions, restraining orders, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=373.84s)]
*  we're blocking and stopping the president's unlawful unconstitutional actions because [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=378.88s)]
*  courts are the place where the law is reviewed and the facts are determined and law is implemented [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=383.44s)]
*  and orders are imposed to make sure that only lawful things are done by the president of the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=391.2s)]
*  United States. So it's unfortunate that we have a president who is so blatantly and brazenly [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=395.36s)]
*  violating the law and the constitution, but it's appropriate for if he does, when he does for [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=400.32s)]
*  states, including the great state of California, to go to court to stop him. And it's important [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=404.56s)]
*  for everyone to fight. People power is the most potent power that there is. We should not be [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=408.96s)]
*  hopeless because we're not helpless. We have agency, we have ability, we have self-determination [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  to fight back. And when our rights are violated, they must be vindicated. We must defend them in [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  court. When the law is broken, justice must be done, and that is done in court. So we are [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=424.48s)]
*  seeing great success, and I'm proud to be able to stand with the Washington attorney general, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=429.36s)]
*  the Oregon attorney general in this town hall. And I know that others around the state and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=433.6s)]
*  the region and the nation are also demonstrating courage and fight and pushing back against a [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=439.04s)]
*  president who is a repeat offender and is unlawful and is violating the constitution regularly. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=445.2s)]
*  All right, California Attorney General Rob Bonta, thank you for being with us. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=451.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sI12hrvgRs&t=474.24s)]
