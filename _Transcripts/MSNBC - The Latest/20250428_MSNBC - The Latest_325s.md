*  I asked Senator Klobuchar and that's that that stunning poll number from the Washington Post that showed [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fptML9b4il0&t=194.7s)]
*  69% of those surveyed said that the Democratic Party is quote-unquote out of touch [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fptML9b4il0&t=201.1s)]
*  That's more than Trump then Trump [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fptML9b4il0&t=207.1s)]
*  Folks say that Trump is out of touch and more who say then say the Republican Party is out of touch [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fptML9b4il0&t=210.38s)]
*  69% that's that's kind of overwhelming. How do you give it despite everything you've said? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fptML9b4il0&t=216.94s)]
*  How do you change the perception in the minds of the electorate that Democrats aren't out of touch? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fptML9b4il0&t=222.45999999999998s)]

*  To be a long uncomfortable hall. We also know that there's not one single bullet that is going to change this [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fptML9b4il0&t=239.26s)]
*  We are in the middle of a movement and it takes all of us. We are fighting in the courts [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fptML9b4il0&t=245.14s)]
*  We are fighting in the halls of Congress and we are fighting in the community [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fptML9b4il0&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  But this is a series of battles that we have to engage in over time as we move to 26 and 28 [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fptML9b4il0&t=252.77999999999997s)]
*  What they're also saying is make sure that you're not deporting US citizens and two-year-old babies that are fighting cancer [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fptML9b4il0&t=259.82s)]
*  Make sure that you're not trying to arrest and deport [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fptML9b4il0&t=267.12s)]

*  Do something now and what we're saying is we're using the courts [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fptML9b4il0&t=279.22s)]
*  We're using Congress and we're using the voices of the community and nothing is going to happen overnight [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fptML9b4il0&t=283.02s)]
*  But Democrats are in it for the long haul and we are going to continue to tell the truth [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fptML9b4il0&t=288.22s)]
