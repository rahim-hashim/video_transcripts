# Deal ‘very much in the cards’: Former diplomat on Trump extending olive branch to Iran
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA)
*  NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel just got an interview with someone close [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=0.0s)]
*  to Iran's supreme leader who might have an answer to that. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=5.08s)]
*  Also with us MSNBC foreign affairs analyst and the former special assistant to President [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=8.56s)]
*  Obama Ambassador Dennis Ross. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=12.88s)]
*  Richard, I know you just spoke with the political and military advisor to the supreme leader. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=15.16s)]
*  Does he think a deal could happen here? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=20.28s)]
*  He wants a deal. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=25.76s)]
*  And I think that was the significant. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=27.04s)]
*  So I sat down earlier today with Ali Shamkhani and he is one of the most powerful men in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=29.0s)]
*  this country. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=35.4s)]
*  One of the few people authorized to talk about these negotiations. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=36.56s)]
*  His initial reaction to President Trump's speech yesterday in Saudi Arabia in which [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=42.36s)]
*  he spent most of his time talking about Iran in very negative terms. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=48.68s)]
*  Talking about how it has been a source of chaos in the region, a sponsor of terrorism, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=52.36s)]
*  a sponsor of destruction. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=58.36s)]
*  He took somewhat of offense to that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=61.08s)]
*  But then in the end he said that he still wants a deal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=64.08s)]
*  He still thinks a deal is possible. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=67.8s)]
*  And again to set up the context of this fight, we'll play it in a second. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=70.28s)]
*  Not only is he one of the few people authorized to speak about the deal, as you mentioned, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=74.44s)]
*  he is an advisor, a top advisor to the supreme leader. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=78.32s)]
*  He's from the Revolutionary Guard. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=82.6s)]
*  He's an admiral. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=84.28s)]
*  He's a hardliner. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=85.44s)]
*  He is also a nuclear advisor to the supreme leader. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=87.28s)]
*  So we're talking about the very top echelons of power and the fact that he agreed to speak [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=91.72s)]
*  to an American, to a journalist, right after President Trump made his comments, I think [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=97.64s)]
*  speaks volumes. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=103.16s)]
*  So here's a little piece of that interview. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=104.16s)]
*  He's open to a deal. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=106.92s)]
*  Is that still possible? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=111.88s)]
*  Or after what you heard, do you think that's impossible? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=113.56s)]
*  A deal is still possible. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=116.84s)]
*  If they do what they say, we can definitely have better relations with the U.S. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=120.0s)]
*  He also laid out in what might be the clearest statements yet from someone at his level, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=127.08s)]
*  someone from the supreme leader's office, what exactly Iran expects and what Iran is [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=133.2s)]
*  willing to do. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=138.88s)]
*  He said that Iran would be willing to get rid of its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=140.24s)]
*  get it out of the country, give it to a third party, not have it anymore, to only enrich [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  to a low level for civilian use, to allow international observers here to supervise [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=150.88s)]
*  the entire process, to commit to never having a nuclear weapon in exchange for the immediate [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=158.52s)]
*  lifting of sanctions. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  He said if that's met, Iran will sign a deal today. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  Richard Engel, thank you so much. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=171.68s)]
*  So Ambassador, you heard him. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  He said a deal is possible, but how do you assess the likelihood of a deal? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=175.64s)]
*  I think there's actually a greater likelihood of a deal than one might imagine, one, because [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=182.56s)]
*  the Iranians actually need it, and two, it's very clear that President Trump wants it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=187.4s)]
*  So if you have one party that needs it and the other one that wants it, even though there's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=192.72s)]
*  obviously a very difficult history here, I think the prospect of a deal is there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=195.96s)]
*  I should note, when I say it, I mean like a framework agreement. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=202.24s)]
*  I think it'll take a long time to produce a much more comprehensive agreement, but a [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=205.68s)]
*  framework agreement that might produce a freeze, downblending of the existing high stockpiles [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=210.08s)]
*  of 60 percent in return for some limiting, some relaxation of sanctions. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=216.16s)]
*  I think that's very much in the cards. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=222.72s)]
*  Whether we see it remains to be seen, but I think it's very much in the cards. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=225.36s)]
*  Well, that's further than we have been many times before. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  Let me ask you about the other big news that's coming out of this trip. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=232.12s)]
*  The Abraham Accords, as you know, were signed five years ago. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=236.28s)]
*  What impact would Syria's signing on have, and do you see that happening? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=239.84s)]
*  I don't see it happening soon. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  I think what you see is what could be a step-by-step approach. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=248.28s)]
*  What I think was important that came out of this meeting, just the fact that the meeting [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  is important, this is a government that is still trying to establish itself. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=256.12s)]
*  This is a government that still has within it elements that are extremist Sunni Islamist [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=260.48s)]
*  elements. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=268.04s)]
*  I think the ability of Ahmed Al-Shahr to deliver on a peace agreement with Israel at this point [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=269.04s)]
*  is probably a bridge too far. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  But he talked about reestablishing the disengagement agreement with the Israelis. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=278.76s)]
*  I think you could see a series of moves in the direction, but I think actually you probably [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  have to see Saudi normalization before you will see Syrian normalization. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=289.0s)]
*  Yet we talked earlier in the show about the fact that these negotiations, these talks [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=293.2s)]
*  are getting underway in Doha just a day after the bombing of a hospital. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=298.28s)]
*  Look, Benjamin Netanyahu has survived a lot. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=304.4s)]
*  His political position, especially early on in the war, was questioned whether he could [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=307.76s)]
*  continue. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=312.28s)]
*  It has survived deaths of hostages, global opposition to some of the actions in Gaza, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=314.2s)]
*  near daily protests in his own country, a lot of criticism from the hostage families. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=318.84s)]
*  NBC News has even been reporting about the rift between President Trump and Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  What do you see as his status continuing to lead Israel? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=331.88s)]
*  He has a government that understands very clearly if there were elections soon, if the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=337.32s)]
*  government were to fall in their elections soon, those who are in the current government [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=342.76s)]
*  wouldn't be in the next one. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=346.8s)]
*  So their sense of self-preservation creates a very strong incentive to preserve the existing [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=348.8s)]
*  coalition. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  There is a split now with the religious parties in the coalition who are insisting that there [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=355.84s)]
*  needs to be new legislation that continues to exempt the ultra-religious. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  That is something that 80 percent of the country is against, because the burden of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=368.58s)]
*  the reservists, the people who have served 300 days in the reserves, while there is a [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=373.38s)]
*  population that's exempt from exhuming and they could make up for the shortfall in personnel [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=378.5s)]
*  that the Israeli military is experiencing, that is a real issue. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=383.62s)]
*  The question is, will those parties follow through on the threats they're making now, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=387.14s)]
*  that if there isn't, in fact, legislation that satisfies them, they will withdraw from the government? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=394.14s)]
*  I think that's a threat that might be real, but I'm just not sure they're prepared to act on it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=399.14s)]
*  So I think you will see, I still think you'll see an election next year. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=403.14s)]
*  I think the real issue is going to be coming up much more quickly. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=408.14s)]
*  You have the Trump administration clearly wanting to negotiate another ceasefire. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=412.14s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu will go along with another ceasefire, but he doesn't want to commit to ending [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=418.14s)]
*  the war because that will bring down the government from the extreme right-wingers like Smotrich and Ben Gavir. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=423.14s)]
*  Now, if there's real pressure from the Trump administration to do a ceasefire deal that lasts for 45 days, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=428.14s)]
*  but at the end of it they want to see the end of the war, that will be the greatest single challenge [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=434.14s)]
*  that Prime Minister Netanyahu will face to the survivability of this government. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=439.14s)]
*  So that we should watch closely. A, is there going to be another hostage deal for 45 days, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=444.14s)]
*  which the administration is trying very hard to produce while the president is still in the region? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=449.14s)]
*  B, if it is, will they insist at the end of 45 days to try to bring that war to an end? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=454.14s)]
*  To do that, they will also need to come up with what will be an alternative to Hamas, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=460.14s)]
*  because you can't just end this war getting the hostages out. You also have to have an alternative to Hamas. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=465.14s)]
*  This Israeli government hasn't been prepared to work on that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=470.14s)]
*  Ultimately, if you don't want Hamas in control, you have to have an alternative to it in Gaza. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6S9XlA0zNA&t=474.14s)]
