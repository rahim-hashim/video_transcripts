# ‘We are six months to a year ahead’ in recovery: Mayor Karen Bass on L.A. wildfire recovery efforts
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI)
*  Los Angeles has been recovering for nearly four months now from the Palisades fire. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=0.0s)]
*  It erupted the morning of January 7th in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood and quickly [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=5.0s)]
*  expanded, covering more than 23,000 acres as it raged for 24 days, destroying more than [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=9.32s)]
*  6,800 homes, businesses, and buildings and claiming 12 lives. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=17.04s)]
*  In her State of the City address last month, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bast touted the speed [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=22.48s)]
*  of the city's recovery, but acknowledged that there's still a long way to go, adding [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=26.78s)]
*  that or those who lost a home every day is too long. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=31.580000000000002s)]
*  Joining us now, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bast. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=37.38s)]
*  Thank you so much for getting up extra early for us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=40.46s)]
*  Mayor Bast, can you just start with giving us a quick status update of where the recovery [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=43.46s)]
*  efforts are? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=48.34s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=49.34s)]
*  I'm happy to do that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=50.34s)]
*  But first of all, congratulations on the new show. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=52.14s)]
*  Thank you, Madam Mayor. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=55.1s)]
*  Well, little over 100 days, the rebuilding, the recovery is going very, very fast. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=57.1s)]
*  As a matter of fact, if you compare to other fires that have happened in our state, we [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=65.26s)]
*  are six months to a year ahead of other locations. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=69.42s)]
*  So at this point in time, the Army Corps of Engineers have cleared 1,100 properties, so [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=73.34s)]
*  that's 1,100 families that can start rebuilding now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=79.02000000000001s)]
*  A couple of weeks ago, I was at a property with the family, and construction was already [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=82.78s)]
*  underway. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=87.22s)]
*  So we had over 6,000 properties destroyed in Palisades. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=88.54s)]
*  And I will tell you, within two months, we had water and power back up, because there [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=93.26s)]
*  are still a couple of hundred people that live in Palisades whose homes were not impacted. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=97.82000000000001s)]
*  So we've had other devastating fires in California. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=104.5s)]
*  And so my comparison as to how we're doing is based on those other fires. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=107.82s)]
*  And in many cases, we're six months to a year ahead of where other cities were. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=112.69999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and Mayor Bass, full disclosure, my husband's family, they lost several of their [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=117.74s)]
*  houses in the fire. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=122.89999999999999s)]
*  So I have seen the recovery efforts up front. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=124.52s)]
*  But something that Palisades are still waiting on is a request for Congress for $40 billion [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  disaster funding across that Gavin Newsom requested that has yet to been fulfilled. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=133.5s)]
*  What gives you any confidence that the Trump administration is going to prioritize this [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=141.18s)]
*  kind of funding? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=145.18s)]
*  And what is your pitch to the president and to Congress on why they should appropriate [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=146.54s)]
*  this ASAP? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=151.14s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=152.14s)]
*  Well, first of all, the governor convened a meeting with a number of us this week. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=153.14s)]
*  And so we're making a full court press effort to make sure that we get those resources. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=158.92s)]
*  I'm actually optimistic. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  And the reason why I am is because the White House really increased the amount of support [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  we had in the first phase, where you're removing the hazardous materials and then also the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=173.92s)]
*  debris. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=180.11999999999998s)]
*  So we had a large number of Army Corps of Engineers that were dispatched to Los Angeles. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=181.11999999999998s)]
*  And so given that track record so far, and we all know it can change, but it has enabled [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=187.56s)]
*  us to move fast. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=194.2s)]
*  And I will tell you, the support from the governor has been amazing from day one. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=196.06s)]
*  Mayor Bass, you know, one of the things that folks who aren't there in LA County, we don't [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=201.84s)]
*  fully appreciate, is that Altadena, which also had these fires, is not kind of in your [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=207.66s)]
*  jurisdiction. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  But I am curious, what are you doing? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  How are you using the immense resources and influence that you guys have there in LA City [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=216.48s)]
*  to help your neighbors in Altadena, which is majority black and brown folks? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=222.66s)]
*  Yeah, and let me just tell you, LA County is huge. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=227.2s)]
*  We have 88 cities in it, and we have a number of unincorporated areas, which means there's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  no mayor, there's no city council, and Altadena is outside of the city of Los Angeles. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=236.04s)]
*  But I can tell you that the person that governs that, Katherine Barger, who is in our county [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=242.2s)]
*  board of supervisors, as a matter of fact, this year she's the president, the two of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=248.66s)]
*  us work very closely together. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=252.26s)]
*  And so we make sure that when we are going for resources, whether it's from the state [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=254.6s)]
*  or the federal government, that we do that in lockstep unity. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=260.24s)]
*  Madam Mayor, I've got two questions for you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=263.9s)]
*  One is piggybacking off of Jackie's question about federal assistance. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=267.88s)]
*  Have you talked to President Trump, or when was the last time you talked to President [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump about the needs of your city? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=279.2s)]
*  Well, I will tell you that I'm in contact with representatives of the administration, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=282.2s)]
*  but I talked to President Trump when he came out to LA, and it was a few days after his [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=288.74s)]
*  inauguration. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=293.44s)]
*  And the contact you have with the administration, would you characterize them, the contact, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=295.0s)]
*  as constant, ongoing? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=302.28s)]
*  Do you have any trouble getting through to anybody, is what I'm asking? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=304.8s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=308.08s)]
*  And you know, it definitely has benefited me, served 12 years in Congress, that I've seen [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=309.88s)]
*  a number of my former colleagues receive appointments in the administration. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=315.6s)]
*  And so it's not been constant. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=320.4s)]
*  There's not been a need for it to be constant, but I've not had difficulty getting through. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=322.32s)]
*  And so I'm just very optimistic. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=326.48s)]
*  I mean, the effort is going along very well now. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=328.4s)]
*  And one population that isn't talked about much are the staff, the employees that worked [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=332.52s)]
*  in the homes, the housekeepers, the nannies, the gardeners, and also people who worked [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  in the business area. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=343.08s)]
*  So one thing that we did very quickly was we opened up four centers around the city, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=344.52s)]
*  because it's not like there was a database of those people for the impacted workers and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  their families to make sure that they received the assistance they need. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=355.24s)]
*  And then a number of them really were small business owners. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=358.92s)]
*  If you were a gardener and you had 10 properties, you had employees. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  So we have to make sure that attention is paid to them as well, many of them also being [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=364.92s)]
*  immigrant workers. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=369.48s)]
*  Madam Mayor, this is actually my second question, and it sort of switches gears here. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=371.48s)]
*  As you well know, we all know lots of folks were not happy with the city's response, with [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=378.12s)]
*  your response. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=384.12s)]
*  And in fact, on Monday, Silicon Valley philanthropist and former RFK Jr. running mate Nicole Shanahan [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=385.44s)]
*  and the group that she is helping to fund filed papers to begin a recall effort, begin [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=394.2s)]
*  an effort to recall you as mayor. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=400.79999999999995s)]
*  And she wrote on X, Los Angeles has endured enough. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  Once a city of hope, it's now overrun with crime, chaos and suffering. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=407.03999999999996s)]
*  Today, we begin the effort to revive the City of Angels for the people. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=410.96s)]
*  First step, recalling Karen Bass. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=414.35999999999996s)]
*  Your reaction to that statement, but also this effort to recall you. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=417.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=423.84s)]
*  You know what? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=424.84s)]
*  Sadly, recalls have almost been a rite of passage for elected officials in California. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=426.32s)]
*  When Gavin Newsom faced a recall, there were 67 recalls going. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=432.16s)]
*  What her motive is, I have no idea because she's not connected to Los Angeles in any [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=436.36s)]
*  way. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=441.6s)]
*  And I do have to say that what she is saying about Los Angeles is not true at all. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=442.8s)]
*  We have reported on a big reduction in crime. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=448.28s)]
*  The city is not in chaos. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=453.04s)]
*  I know that the coverage of the fires in the beginning, a lot of people thought the entire [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=455.16s)]
*  city was on fire. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=460.0s)]
*  And Los Angeles is a very big, very sprawling city. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=461.92s)]
*  And so I would disagree with what she's saying to begin with. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  And the status of the recall, I don't know. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  I certainly hope it does not move forward. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=473.04s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  It costs an awful lot of money. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  And frankly, I'm up for reelection in June. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=478.36s)]
*  And the earliest there would be an election would be January. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=481.12s)]
*  So given the deficit that we're facing in Los Angeles, the last thing we need to do [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=484.08000000000004s)]
*  is to have two elections. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=488.64s)]
*  The other thing is, is that I am laser focused on getting the people who lived in the Palisades [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=491.2s)]
*  to return home. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=497.56s)]
*  And the idea that you would inject something like this into the state's worst natural disaster [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=499.24s)]
*  in recent history, I think is frankly irresponsible. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=505.6s)]
*  Well, on that point, Mayor Bass, my understanding is that in order for Palisades residents to [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=508.76s)]
*  start rebuilding, they need to provide soil testing in order to get mortgages to start [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=517.04s)]
*  that rebuild process. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=522.9599999999999s)]
*  My understanding is also that in previous fires, FEMA had taken on the important task [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  of doing this soil testing for contamination. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=528.12s)]
*  Why weren't you and your team able to get FEMA to continue this practice of doing the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  soil testing themselves? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=536.8399999999999s)]
*  So let me just say that you do not need that in order to rebuild. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=540.16s)]
*  So we have over 300 people who are in line. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=544.32s)]
*  Their building permits have already been approved because I fast tracked everything, eliminating [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=547.74s)]
*  the red tape, also eliminating the fees, because why should someone have to pay fees? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=552.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not like they're remodeling their home. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=558.36s)]
*  This was a natural disaster. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=560.58s)]
*  And so what you are referring to, though, unfortunately, is an issue for Washington. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=562.6800000000001s)]
*  That's not a local nor is it a state decision. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=568.32s)]
*  It is a decision about the mission of FEMA and what was required. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=571.58s)]
*  In previous fires, you are correct. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=576.08s)]
*  Testing was required after in the first phase. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=578.7s)]
*  The first phase is now over. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=582.6600000000001s)]
*  We are in the second phase. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=584.6s)]
*  So it would be up to the White House to expand that. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=586.1800000000001s)]
*  Now, what some individuals have done is that they have gotten testing on their own, whether [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=588.98s)]
*  it was from a philanthropic area initiative or insurance or they've paid for it themselves. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=594.18s)]
*  But if you do find toxics, then you also really would be obligated to remove those toxics. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=602.3s)]
*  Unfortunately, that would not be an expense that FEMA would reimburse. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=609.14s)]
*  Mayor Bass, in the minute that we have you, the governor of your state, Governor Gavin [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=613.8199999999999s)]
*  Newsom, has come under fire from Democrats for this podcast that he's had where he's [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=619.64s)]
*  had far right wing media personalities like Charlie Kirk, Steve Bannon. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=623.8s)]
*  His explanation is that at the end of the day, we should be having conversations and [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=630.16s)]
*  that Democrats lost and that you guys should be having conversations with everyone. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=634.4799999999999s)]
*  Is he making a political mistake here or is this a good move for him and should other [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=639.26s)]
*  Democrats do it? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=643.18s)]
*  You know, I mean, I have to be honest with you. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=645.78s)]
*  I've not heard the podcast. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=647.4s)]
*  I've not been following the podcast. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=648.7199999999999s)]
*  I know you've seen the clips, ma'am. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=649.7199999999999s)]
*  But what I have followed. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=650.7199999999999s)]
*  No, honestly, I probably haven't. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=652.64s)]
*  I am aware. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=655.52s)]
*  I am aware of the podcast that he's doing. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=656.52s)]
*  But I just have to tell you, I'm laser focused, working with the governor lockstep on getting [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=659.6s)]
*  Los Angeles rebuilt in 15 months. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=665.5600000000001s)]
*  Los Angeles is going to welcome the world for the World Cup. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=668.88s)]
*  And you know, in three years, we have the Olympics. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=672.4200000000001s)]
*  So while we are focusing on getting the Palisades rebuilt and the other areas in the county [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=675.0s)]
*  that were devastated by the fires, we're also preparing for these major international events. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=680.48s)]
*  With all of that on my plate. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=686.52s)]
*  Sorry, not following the podcast. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=688.08s)]
*  Karen Bass, mayor of the great city of Los Angeles. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=691.44s)]
*  Thank you very much for coming to the weekend. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJgiQlYPlbI&t=694.08s)]
