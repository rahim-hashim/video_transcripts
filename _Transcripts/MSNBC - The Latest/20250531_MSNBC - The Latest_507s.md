# The people’s guide to beating back authoritarianism with noodles, satire, and more
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo)
*  More and more Americans are asking a critical question. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=0.0s)]
*  What can I do to defend democracy in America? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=3.2s)]
*  That question marks a shift away from the comforting illusion that courts, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=7.2s)]
*  politicians, or institutions will save America's democracy on their own. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  They won't. Institutions have failed us repeatedly, as we've learned. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=16.16s)]
*  What we thought were guardrails are merely suggestions, reliant on goodwill, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=21.12s)]
*  decency, and the honor system. Real political change in America doesn't [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=25.04s)]
*  come from the top. It never has. It comes from the bottom. Ordinary people resisting in big [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  and small ways. That's the legacy of the civil rights movement. The political scientist Gene [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=33.68s)]
*  Sharpe, nicknamed the dictator slayer, wrote something of a playbook for resisting authoritarian [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  regimes. He didn't invent these strategies. He observed them. For decades, Sharpe studied [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=43.76s)]
*  how ordinary people challenged brutal regimes around the world. And what he found was simple, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=48.32s)]
*  yet powerful. All rulers, even the most oppressive, rely on the cooperation of their people. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=53.6s)]
*  Through fear, apathy, or consent, they maintain power. But when people refuse to cooperate, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=61.6s)]
*  when they disobey, authoritarian systems begin to crack. That's why historian Timothy Snyder [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=69.2s)]
*  begins his book titled On Tyranny with this warning. Do not obey in advance. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=76.0s)]
*  Because it's in those first, often invisible, acts of surrender that authoritarianism takes root. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=82.88s)]
*  Now, as we face creeping authoritarianism here at home, Snyder's advice stands as a call to action [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=89.6s)]
*  for Americans confronting Trump and the rise of oligarchic rule. What happens when ordinary people [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=94.64s)]
*  act? History shows that the courage to stand up to authority and to hold power to account has helped [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=101.6s)]
*  to sustain our democracy for generations and other democracies around the world. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=108.24s)]
*  The historian and former president of Harvard, Drew Gilpin Faust, captured that spirit in a [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=113.28s)]
*  powerful essay about the Union soldiers of the Civil War. She wrote, quote, I have read dozens [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=118.16s)]
*  of these men's letters and diaries, windows into what and whom they loved and what they hoped for [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=123.44s)]
*  at the end of a war they knew they might not survive. Together, they did save the Union. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=130.16s)]
*  These men made our lives possible. They were impelled to risk all by a sense of obligation [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=137.27999999999997s)]
*  to the future. We possess a reciprocal obligation to the past. We must not squander what they bequeathed [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  to us, end quote. We owe it to them and to every generation that came after them. Those women who [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=149.76s)]
*  won the right to vote, those students who walked into newly desegregated schools under armed guard, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=157.04s)]
*  those trade unionists who faced violence for fighting for the rights of workers, those who [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=162.16s)]
*  fought for voting rights, reproductive freedom, LGBTQ plus dignity, they did not wait for permission. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=166.48s)]
*  They disobeyed in advance. They withdrew their cooperation from injustice. Oftentimes, they [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=172.96s)]
*  blatantly and openly broke the law as TV cameras rolled, which brings us back to Gene Sharp's basic [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=179.76s)]
*  premise. It's a very Gandhian premise. He believed that non-cooperation, the deliberate refusal to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=185.36s)]
*  obey or comply, is one of the most powerful ways to disrupt oppressive systems because when enough [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  people stop participating in the machinery of control, the very system begins to break down. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=197.84s)]
*  So if you're wondering what you can do, here are some ideas that draw from proven strategies of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  resistance adapted for today's world. One tactic is to overload the administrative systems. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=209.84s)]
*  In Missouri, a government-run tip line targeting the trans community was flooded with thousands of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  fake reports, including the entire movie script of the B-movie submitted over and over again. The [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=220.4s)]
*  result? Total system collapse. Utah and Texas faced similar backlashes, with Utah shutting down [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=225.84s)]
*  its own surveillance hotline under the weight of memes and mass trolling. Another tactic is [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=231.44000000000003s)]
*  civil disobedience of illegitimate laws. This, of course, is what undergirded the civil rights [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=238.0s)]
*  movement in America. But here's a more recent example. In Idaho, a middle school teacher [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=242.08s)]
*  refused to remove a sign that said, everyone is welcome here. That's all said. Didn't mention [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  politics or gender. It was just deemed to be too controversial. After a months-long battle, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  she resigned two weeks ago in protest, writing in part, I cannot align myself nor be complicit [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=258.8s)]
*  with the exclusionary views and decisions of this administration. It is deeply troubling that the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=264.0s)]
*  people running this district and school have allowed a welcoming and inclusive message for [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=269.52s)]
*  my students to be considered controversial, political, and worst of all, an opinion. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  Then there's political non-cooperation, which can include using the opposition's own tools [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=281.52s)]
*  against them. In 2024, Oklahoma's Republican-controlled legislature passed a law [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=286.88s)]
*  allowing parents to opt their children out of quote, harmful education material. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=292.32s)]
*  Now a group of parents has turned that law on its head in response to State Superintendent Ryan [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=298.88s)]
*  Walter's new curriculum, which includes conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and Christian [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  national ideology. A parent's group called We're Oklahoma Education, the acronym for that, by the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  way, is woke, is fighting back. They've created an opt-out form allowing families to withdraw [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=315.52s)]
*  their children from lessons on Judeo-Christian concepts of ethics and government and discrepancies [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=321.36s)]
*  in 2020 election results. Parents can also prohibit their children from any exposure to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=326.8s)]
*  Walter's himself, including his cringy video messages. Their approach is not only bold, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=332.0s)]
*  but legally savvy. The group is using the very law that conservatives passed that was designed [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  to shield students from so-called progressive content. The opt-out letter warns schools that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=342.08000000000004s)]
*  failure to comply could result in legal action. Then, and this is one that's close to my heart, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=347.04s)]
*  there's economic non-cooperation. When Target pulled Pride merchandise and scaled back diversity, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=353.6s)]
*  equity, and inclusion commitments, thousands of Americans launched a boycott campaign on TikTok, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=359.12s)]
*  Facebook, and other platforms. The result? Target's quarterly profits dropped and the company [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=363.92s)]
*  admitted that backlash from both sides had harmed its bottom line. These efforts show how economic [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=369.68s)]
*  disruption can force big business and powerful institutions to feel the cost of discriminatory [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=375.2s)]
*  decisions. And then there's what's known as nonviolent interjection. As an example, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  during the Muslim ban in the first Trump administration, immigration attorneys organized [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=388.64s)]
*  within hours coordinating airport defense through encrypted chats and social media. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=393.28s)]
*  More recently in Worcester, Massachusetts, viral footage of an aggressive ICE raid showed federal [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=399.12s)]
*  agents detaining a woman as her daughters clung to a car, one holding a baby. Bystanders, including [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=403.92s)]
*  a city counselor and a school board candidate, intervened. The video sparked immediate outrage, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=410.72s)]
*  protests across the state. In response, Worcester officials released body cam footage and then took [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  action. The city issued an executive order barring city employees from cooperating with ICE or [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  inquiring about immigration status. Which brings us to the final and perhaps my favorite form of [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=427.12s)]
*  disruption, humor. The civil rights activist Bruce Hartford noted that humor and audacity go hand in [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=432.72s)]
*  hand. You can weaken unbalance and ultimately overthrow the king quicker by laughing at him [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  than by futilely screaming fury at him, end quote. Groups like the Church of the Flying Spaghetti [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=444.24s)]
*  Monster and the Satanic Temple have used satire to expose religious favoritism in public institutions. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=450.8s)]
*  The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, whose adherents refer to themselves as pastafarians, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=456.48s)]
*  mocked efforts to teach intelligent design in public schools by proposing a noodle-based deity [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=461.84s)]
*  their own noodle-based deity, highlighting the dangers of blurring church and state. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=468.0s)]
*  The Satanic Temple took similar action, demanding equal representation when governments promoted [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  Christian symbols like the Ten Commandments monuments or sanctioned prayer in public schools. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=477.44s)]
*  Their logic forced officials to either accommodate all religions or retract their policies altogether. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=482.08s)]
*  So if you're asking yourself what one person can do, these are just some starters. These are ideas [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=488.48s)]
*  to hopefully get you thinking. And remember this final piece of advice from the historian [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=492.64000000000004s)]
*  Timothy Snyder, quote, be as courageous as you can. If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  then all of us will die under tyranny, end quote. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJCU0HSVqo&t=503.28000000000003s)]
