# Losing economic alliances and risking national security ones over trade war: Economist
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8)
*  I want to bring in NBC business and data correspondent Brian Chung and former director of the Congressional Budget Office Douglas Holtz-Eakin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=0.0s)]
*  He is now president of the American Action Forum. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=7.2s)]
*  Hey, so Brian, we're seeing all these issues and Janice was bringing us, you know, this factory that makes hair products and talking about baby car seats. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=9.8s)]
*  The vast majority of which are brought or bought in the United States are made in China. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=17.3s)]
*  Just how much control does the Chinese regime have over Chinese industry because they're able to have a lot more say on everything in that country? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=22.4s)]
*  Yeah, and they can do it a lot more quickly than even here in the United States, where some of those actions might otherwise require an act of Congress, you know, beyond just whatever the president can do. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=34.4s)]
*  But I want to point out that the types of things that you are listing here when we talk about Hollywood movies, right, they have stopped effectively exports of those types of things, as well as with Boeing jets. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=52.0s)]
*  That has been catching a lot of attention this week. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=52.5s)]
*  But I want to point out that in the same way that the United States is putting up tariffs to say, hey, well, you should buy domestically, those same actions are likely what the Chinese government is trying to do with their tariff walls now built up just as high as we set on them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=53.9s)]
*  Because they have their own domestic movie industry. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=67.3s)]
*  They have their own even domestic plane production. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=69.6s)]
*  They have been turning out their own jets over there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=71.8s)]
*  So it's not necessarily the case that Boeing's were even that substantial of a percentage of orders for Chinese aviation companies in the first place to begin with. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=74.5s)]
*  So I do think that if it is indeed the case that these tariffs are here to stay, if they're not a negotiating tactic, which is a kind of big question still politically, really, regardless, what we're talking about here is a potential decoupling of these two economies where China can go it alone on some of these industries. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  In fact, they've maybe been setting themselves up with the past. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=98.2s)]
*  Auto industry. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=100.4s)]
*  They have their own auto industry as well. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=101.5s)]
*  So it's a different story than, say, let's say in the 2000s where they needed the United States to get some of this heavy industrial, you know, also cultural types of exports. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=103.0s)]
*  They kind of have it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=111.4s)]
*  They kind of have it domestically in some cases. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  On the other hand, they very much depend on the American consumer. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=114.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  I mean, these are the two largest economies in the world and they are very deeply intertwined. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=119.10000000000001s)]
*  So if there's a if there is a decoupling, that's a big deal. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  Douglas, the leader of the Chinese regime was visiting Southeast Asia to try to shore up those relationships in the middle of the trade war. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=125.6s)]
*  What kind of impact could they have? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=132.9s)]
*  And Xi Jinping has been meeting with all kinds of leaders. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=134.6s)]
*  I'm thinking of the Cuban regime that was over there some time ago. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=138.7s)]
*  What impact are his visits having? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=142.9s)]
*  Well, the real risk here is that not only will we have some decoupling with China, but that China will forge stronger economic relations with its Asian neighbors, but also with the European Union and other traditional allies in the United States. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=146.9s)]
*  And at the moment, you know, we've got tariffs on Europe and they're not negotiating either. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=160.9s)]
*  So we were losing the economic alliances and we're risking losing the national security alliances. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=165.9s)]
*  Those national security alliances. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=172.9s)]
*  And I was just thinking the role that China plays precisely in destabilizing many of those security alliances. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=174.9s)]
*  Thinking of what China has been doing, you know, even in the Russian invasion of Ukraine and all the investments and all of the pressures that China has been carrying out in Central America and in South America for years now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=182.1s)]
*  Douglas. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=197.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, there's no question that China is a strategic rival, and I don't think anyone questions the need to to confront them in many ways. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=199.3s)]
*  The issue is what exactly is the Trump administration trying to accomplish? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=208.3s)]
*  So they say China needs to make a deal. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=212.3s)]
*  What is it that they want from China? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=214.3s)]
*  What is it? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=216.3s)]
*  What is it they want them to change in the way of their economic behavior, their national security behavior? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=217.3s)]
*  And I'll just point out that, you know, the president is has levied tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos and is, you know, intended to do a lot of pharmaceuticals and chips and lumber and copper, all in the interest of national security. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=222.3s)]
*  Go it alone is not national security. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=236.3s)]
*  Having good alliances and keeping those trade flows alive when things are tough is part of national security. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=239.3s)]
*  And that's what we're risking right now. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=245.3s)]
*  And today's California governor plans to file a lawsuit to challenge Trump's authority to enact these tariffs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=247.3s)]
*  Brian, what else can you tell us about? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=253.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is a pretty big deal. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=254.3s)]
*  I believe this is the first challenge domestically of a state against our own nation's policies on tariffs. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=255.3s)]
*  Gavin Newsom announcing this early this morning. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=260.3s)]
*  Take a listen to his justification for wanting to go after the federal government on the terror policy. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=262.3s)]
*  California is the largest manufacturing state in our union, one of the largest trading partners around the globe. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=268.3s)]
*  No state will be impacted more than the state of California as it relates to the unilateral authority that's been asserted by the Trump administration to impose the largest tax increase in modern American history. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=275.3s)]
*  I mean, it is indeed the case that the state of California independently is such a big, big economy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=288.3s)]
*  You were to kind of throw, you know, parse it out from the rest of the United States as well. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=293.3s)]
*  Oh, it's huge. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=296.3s)]
*  It's huge. And I think that not only as a manufacturer, as the governor was kind of characterizing there, but also as an importer of goods specifically from China, given its proximity to Asia, it's a lot closer, you know, across the Pacific Ocean than it is to the East Coast. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=297.3s)]
*  But I do think that the legal questions here are very much big. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=309.3s)]
*  Like, what is the authority of a state to challenge the federal government's authority over putting these tariffs in place? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=313.3s)]
*  I think those mechanisms and whether or not California has a shot in court is a separate question. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=318.3s)]
*  Yeah, Douglas, what do you think about how much power does a single state have when it comes to tariffs vis-a-vis the federal government? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=323.3s)]
*  Well, you know, the Constitution is quite clear about the federal government's role in interstate commerce. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=330.3s)]
*  And so I think it's going to be hard for individual states to assert some authority over these kind of international commerce issues. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=335.3s)]
*  But the question of the president's authority to levy these tariffs has come up before. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=343.3s)]
*  The Senate questioned his ability to declare the emergency powers, the emergencies, to give him the power to levy the tariffs. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=348.3s)]
*  And, you know, the United States is in a national economic emergency. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=353.3s)]
*  But we haven't said the nature of that emergency. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=357.3s)]
*  I think it'd be wise for the Congress to reassert some of its authority over the president, say, OK, you want to have an emergency? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=359.3s)]
*  Tell us what it is. Tell us how long it's going to last. Under what circumstances is it over? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=365.3s)]
*  And we haven't seen anything like that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=369.3s)]
*  Douglas Holtzik and Brian Chung, thank you very much. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=371.3s)]
*  Thank you very much. By the way, the White House is telling us right now that the president is meeting right as we speak with Japanese officials vis-a-vis the economic policy of the United States. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=373.3s)]
*  I thank you both so very much for being with us. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=384.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NpnpdjEOj8&t=403.3s)]
