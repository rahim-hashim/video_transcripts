# The long history of the Kashmir conflict: Breaking down India-Pakistan tensions
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI)
*  Just hours after President Trump announced a ceasefire agreement this weekend between India and Pakistan, explosions were once again heard across major cities across the region. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=0.0s)]
*  Dozens have been killed on both sides in fighting which started on Wednesday between the two enemy nuclear powers, triggering an apparent mediation effort from the United States. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=10.0s)]
*  India and Pakistan have fought several wars with each other, often involving the disputed Kashmir region. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=19.0s)]
*  This most recent fighting followed an April 22 terrorist attack that killed more than two dozen tourists in the Indian controlled part of Kashmir. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=25.0s)]
*  Pakistan denied any connection, but India attacked Pakistan in response. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=33.0s)]
*  Now the enmity between India and Pakistan centers on Kashmir. It's a mountainous area. It's this area here. It's about the size of Utah. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=38.0s)]
*  It's surrounded by India, by Pakistan, by Afghanistan, in the northwest, and by China in the east. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=46.0s)]
*  Kashmir has a long and rich history. It's been inhabited by many peoples, including Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and Dogras. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=52.0s)]
*  In 1846, at the end of the first Anglo-Sikh war, a loosely defined border resembling today's Kashmir region was drawn. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=60.0s)]
*  And it acted as a sort of a buffer zone between the British Empire, which was in the Indian subcontinent, which it controlled as a colony starting in 1858, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=70.0s)]
*  and the Russian and Chinese empires. Flash forward to 1947, when India and Pakistan both gained independence from Great Britain. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=81.0s)]
*  Some states became part of majority Hindu India. Other parts became part of majority Muslim Pakistan. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=89.0s)]
*  The Maharaja of Kashmir initially tried to remain independent, but eventually opted to be part of India, a decision that didn't sit well with the majority of Kashmiris. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=96.0s)]
*  War soon broke out between Pakistan, which rejected that decision and claimed Kashmir as its own, and India. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=105.0s)]
*  That war ended with a UN-brokered ceasefire with a line established dividing Kashmir. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=112.0s)]
*  Now, that line was supposed to be temporary, but it became the official line of control in 1972, following the third Indo-Pakistani war, and that border is still in place today. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=118.0s)]
*  Pakistan administers the northern and western portions, which are comprised of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=130.0s)]
*  India administers the areas of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=138.0s)]
*  Also, China controls about 15% of the eastern portions of Kashmir. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=143.0s)]
*  It's important to note that both India and Pakistan are US allies, and perhaps most importantly, both of them have nuclear weapons. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=149.0s)]
*  And there have been multiple deadly conflicts and incidents since the end of the last Indo-Pakistani war in 1972. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=157.0s)]
*  However, things had been relatively calm for several years until the April 22nd attack. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=164.0s)]
*  India blamed Pakistan and vowed retaliation. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=169.0s)]
*  On Wednesday, India struck several sites in both Pakistan and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir and inside of Pakistan itself. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=172.0s)]
*  Pakistan responded with its own strikes, both in Indian-controlled Kashmir and inside India. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=181.0s)]
*  The situation escalated by the day with India and Pakistan trading attacks. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=187.0s)]
*  The United States, Saudi Arabia, China, Qatar, and even Iran were involved in separate and urgent diplomatic efforts to bring about a ceasefire. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=192.0s)]
*  Well, 24 hours ago, a ceasefire was announced, but within hours, explosions and strikes were reported in both Indian and Pakistani-administered Kashmir, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=200.0s)]
*  each side blaming the other for violating the deal. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MFKlH-hVI&t=209.0s)]
