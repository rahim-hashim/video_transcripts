# Ari on the crucial secret to beating Trump’s second-term tactics
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo)
*  President Trump's second term has been rockier than his first. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=0.0s)]
*  We are now about 128 days in. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=4.0s)]
*  And there have been more legally extreme measures [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  out of the White House than blocked in court. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=10.0s)]
*  More than the first term at this point. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=12.52s)]
*  Right here, more market volatility, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=15.48s)]
*  specifically driven by Trump's tariffs [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=17.72s)]
*  than any other government move driving [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=20.04s)]
*  this kind of volatility in decades. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=22.64s)]
*  And that up and down, that volatility [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=25.48s)]
*  reflects two problems for Trump. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  First, widespread rejection of his trade war. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  And that's been a problem for weeks, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=37.0s)]
*  which is part of why he's backed off. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=39.76s)]
*  But second is the growing awareness of the reality [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=41.12s)]
*  that while Trump opens with the strongman approach [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=44.92s)]
*  and vows a tough stand, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  he then often later backs down under pressure. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=49.16s)]
*  It's something that China found by standing up [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=52.959999999999994s)]
*  to President Trump and hitting back on the tariffs. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  And that reality undercuts Trump's claimed business persona, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=58.96s)]
*  the tough negotiator who will always get results. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=63.28s)]
*  Now, we know some people believe in that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=66.8s)]
*  Politically, that's fine. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=70.64s)]
*  But we're past campaign season. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=71.68s)]
*  Trump is president. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  And he's been opening with these giant bids. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=75.4s)]
*  Some call it maximalism, if you want to get fancy. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  But people are learning his patterns, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=81.08s)]
*  where he'll issue a huge demand, create a crisis. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  But increasingly often, he will end up backing down [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=85.04s)]
*  on the Times reports. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=88.8s)]
*  Quick example we all lived through. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump hit China with big tariffs. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=92.48s)]
*  He warned them, quote, do not retaliate, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=94.56s)]
*  as if he could control the response of a foreign nation, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=97.6s)]
*  which has its own economy, its own issues, its own military, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=102.08s)]
*  just by tapping that out in all caps [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=105.24s)]
*  from the White House account. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=107.84s)]
*  It didn't work. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  As you probably know, China did retaliate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=111.52s)]
*  They matched the tariffs. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  It drove a clash that went up and up, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  at one point hitting 145% tariffs, which is literally [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=117.28s)]
*  more than double the cost of every item from that country. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=122.28s)]
*  And everyone knew that wasn't sustainable. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=125.16s)]
*  In other words, we weren't going to have years [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=127.56s)]
*  with everything costing double. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=129.68s)]
*  The real impacts began. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=131.44s)]
*  The US ports began to empty out. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=132.84s)]
*  Companies started warning the higher prices were [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=136.24s)]
*  coming from Trump tariffs. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=138.6s)]
*  And then the empty shelves were going to come. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=140.28s)]
*  And as the weeks went by, before that hit, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=143.76s)]
*  at an actual crisis level, Trump backed off [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=146.16s)]
*  most of the key tariffs. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=150.76s)]
*  And he did it by himself. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=153.44s)]
*  He blinked, because China did not offer real concessions. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=154.48s)]
*  There was no trade deal, no handshake, no big announcement [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=159.2s)]
*  where both leaders get to say everyone's winning something. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=163.28s)]
*  No, he just backed down. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=166.04s)]
*  And business leaders have been facing this in real time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=167.96s)]
*  And you know I always try to level with you. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=171.56s)]
*  If you're busy living your life, you may not [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=173.44s)]
*  have understandably followed every back and forth trade [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=175.28s)]
*  threat. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=179.52s)]
*  You might have said, well, see how high prices get [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=180.24s)]
*  at the Walmart or the bodega. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=182.36s)]
*  And until then, be busy with life. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=184.04s)]
*  But the people who trade this stuff and trade stocks, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=185.4s)]
*  they've been dealing with it daily. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=188.4s)]
*  In the Times reports, many of those on Wall Street [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=189.76s)]
*  say Trump has clearly been chickening out. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=192.16s)]
*  They've even coined a phrase, a shorthand, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=195.72s)]
*  Trump always chickens out, which spells out [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=199.16s)]
*  the acronym TACO. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=202.4s)]
*  And this is like real news. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=205.36s)]
*  This is really something they're saying. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=206.72s)]
*  And that's coming from Wall Street, which leans right [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=208.68s)]
*  and is a place where negotiating is a big deal. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=210.88s)]
*  It's a type of skill. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=214.0s)]
*  They take it seriously. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=215.08s)]
*  Now today we saw the president bristles at the TACO term. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=217.44s)]
*  He said the question, even asking about it, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=221.4s)]
*  was quote, nasty, that coming from a politician known [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=223.6s)]
*  for his very tough nicknames and attacks [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=227.76s)]
*  on all kinds of other people. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=229.52s)]
*  But I guess the word chicken is too much for him today. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=230.72s)]
*  Now that's just in the trade war. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=234.24s)]
*  The battles are measurable there, and the news comes fast. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=236.12s)]
*  But what I want to talk to you about tonight [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=239.64s)]
*  is how these lessons could apply more broadly, which, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=241.34s)]
*  it's no exaggeration to say, could affect our free speech [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=245.12s)]
*  and democracy in this country if people [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=248.92s)]
*  learn the right lessons. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=250.88s)]
*  As Trump's approach backfires and clashes [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=252.64s)]
*  with people and groups who have at least the power and money [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=255.6s)]
*  to fight back and who choose to fight back, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=258.56s)]
*  who use their power, because we can now document over these 120 [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=263.76s)]
*  plus days who is winning. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=268.08s)]
*  And so Trump has convinced many supporters [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=270.88s)]
*  that he's the boss he played in his fictional television show, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=272.76s)]
*  which we all remember. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=277.76s)]
*  It was on our sister channel, NBC, back when he was just [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=278.76s)]
*  doing reality TV. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=281.88s)]
*  But what's interesting right now is [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=283.88s)]
*  how he is trying to sort of enact [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=285.48s)]
*  that version of reality in the White House, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=287.48s)]
*  and it is faltering. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=289.64000000000004s)]
*  Posturing a performance, a presidential version [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=291.16s)]
*  of the boss he played in The Apprentice [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=293.6s)]
*  is how Jonathan Chait writes in The Atlantic. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=297.0s)]
*  Quote, sitting in a plush leather chair, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=300.0s)]
*  doling out justice to quavering supplicants. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=302.12s)]
*  But the evidence suggests a clear pattern, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=304.44s)]
*  although Trump's instructs targets to submit. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  Doing so merely sets them up for more humiliation and abuse. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=310.36s)]
*  So Trump demanded China surrender, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=315.88s)]
*  just as he wanted universities and law firms to surrender [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  to those executive orders, which were unfair and probably [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=321.36s)]
*  illegal, although the day they came down, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=325.48s)]
*  there wasn't a court ruling on that yet by definition. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=327.16s)]
*  But I can remind you, the federal government's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=329.8s)]
*  usually restricted from using its powers to say punish [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=331.64000000000004s)]
*  dissent and First Amendment protected free speech. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=335.16s)]
*  And Trump made it more likely he would lose in court [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  because he admitted those were the motivations. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  For example, say we just are trying to make sure [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=343.72s)]
*  that we regulate law firms. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  He said, I'm going after firms named X, Y, and Z, Wilmer, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=347.44000000000005s)]
*  Hale, because they represented people I don't like. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  Harvard has power, prestige, and more money [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=354.56s)]
*  than most corporations. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  They've been winning. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=358.12s)]
*  They have a $50 billion endowment, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=359.36s)]
*  so they've been fighting back. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  They got a federal judge to shut down [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=363.32000000000005s)]
*  one of the retaliation plots that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=365.40000000000003s)]
*  would try to ban any new students from abroad [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=368.36s)]
*  from going to Harvard, which seems pretty unfair [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=371.32s)]
*  and now is not happening, as long as a judge keeps [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=374.12s)]
*  that frozen. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=377.56s)]
*  Law firms who fought Trump executive orders [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=378.8s)]
*  have won three times just this month already. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=380.68s)]
*  So that's the power of pushback. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=384.04s)]
*  But that's not all. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=386.92s)]
*  You can say, OK, Ari, that's some examples, right? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  That's examples on one side. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  Now let's just briefly contrast it [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=393.2s)]
*  to the law firms and the universities [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=396.2s)]
*  that just gave in. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=397.88s)]
*  Maybe they were trying to avoid Trump's ire. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=400.0s)]
*  But here's the deal in the second term, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=403.24s)]
*  different than the first. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=407.44s)]
*  He is more blunt and direct. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=409.2s)]
*  He is unshackled. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=410.96s)]
*  And he sees their surrender as weakness [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=412.64s)]
*  that invites more abuse. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=415.44s)]
*  Trump now openly plotting to push those surrender law firms [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=417.2s)]
*  to do even more free work for him and his agenda, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=421.28s)]
*  even though they already gave in. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=423.96s)]
*  Columbia is one of the universities that basically [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=426.2s)]
*  gave in earlier. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=428.36s)]
*  And it's found Trump is not even letting up for a few weeks. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=429.2s)]
*  New York Times headline there showing [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=432.8s)]
*  this government with so many things to deal with [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=435.12s)]
*  is back at Columbia arguing the school is discriminating [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=437.8s)]
*  against Jewish students as it goes after them on Trump's [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=442.12s)]
*  continuing retribution tour. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=445.56s)]
*  Now let's be clear. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=448.0s)]
*  The administration is citing an area, an issue, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=451.52s)]
*  where Trump is referring to a real world problem. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=455.32s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is a very ancient hatred that endures. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=458.56s)]
*  It's a problem in America. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=463.52s)]
*  It's a problem in many countries. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=464.88s)]
*  But weaponizing it for partisan politics [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=467.52s)]
*  in a way that has left many experts, and Jewish leaders, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=470.84000000000003s)]
*  by the way, opposed to Trump's effort to hijack the concern. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=474.24s)]
*  That's one of the problems with leaning on a real problem [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=478.96s)]
*  to try to settle scores, because it appears to clearly be, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=482.64s)]
*  according to the evidence, part of the ongoing retribution [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=486.4s)]
*  crackdowns, whether that's law firms that represented [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=489.71999999999997s)]
*  his opponents, like I mentioned, or students [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=492.59999999999997s)]
*  who simply oppose MAGA and Trump agenda items who [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=495.12s)]
*  happen to go to Columbia. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=499.0s)]
*  So part of it's about abuse and administration so extreme [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  that it targets free speech so much that it's already [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=503.44s)]
*  run into walls in court. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=506.88s)]
*  But the other part here is about something [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=508.35999999999996s)]
*  that I bet you know about, because you [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=510.09999999999997s)]
*  are watching MSNBC, whether you're doing that on live TV [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  or YouTube, or however you're hearing my voice, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=515.36s)]
*  I bet you have an interest in political strategy, which [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=517.52s)]
*  is still how part of the world works. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=520.76s)]
*  And in politics, you have seasoned veterans [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=523.08s)]
*  that may have some lessons for the novices here. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=524.92s)]
*  And no disrespect, but we've seen some novices, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=527.88s)]
*  some rookies, give in to Trump, hoping [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=531.02s)]
*  that they could just duck the MAGA politics of America [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=533.92s)]
*  right now, only to find out that's impossible if he [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=536.84s)]
*  wants to come get you. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=541.5600000000001s)]
*  Because some of these MAGA crackdowns [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=543.84s)]
*  are coming for you either way. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=545.72s)]
*  And surrendering will not make them go away. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=548.52s)]
*  In the same piece I mentioned, Mr. Chait writes [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=550.6800000000001s)]
*  that winning with Trump is impossible because the relationship [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=553.2s)]
*  itself is lose-lose. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=555.84s)]
*  Attempts to turn a productive connection into an exploitive [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=557.44s)]
*  one create these losses for both sides. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=559.84s)]
*  That's probably the difference between compromise, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=564.1600000000001s)]
*  which people have to do all the time at work or in life [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  with sometimes disagreeable people or situations, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=569.76s)]
*  the difference between that and countering [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=573.68s)]
*  an extreme threat for the extreme threat that it is. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=577.16s)]
*  A former FBI chief who prosecuted the mafia, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=580.88s)]
*  so he knows that turf, has now compared [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=584.0799999999999s)]
*  surrendering to Trump's second term tactics [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=586.92s)]
*  to surrendering to mob tactics. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=590.3599999999999s)]
*  Veteran FBI director James Comey, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=593.64s)]
*  who is now facing yet another Trump-sparked probe, which [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=596.0s)]
*  looks like retaliation, we'll let the courts decide, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=598.62s)]
*  broke down exactly that comparison here on MSNBC. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=601.48s)]
*  They must have never seen a mob movie [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=606.32s)]
*  because you give the mob a piece of your bar, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=608.08s)]
*  first thing they do is bring their friends in to drink [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=610.76s)]
*  for free, then they burn it down for the insurance. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=612.48s)]
*  They will be sorry they made a deal with this administration. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=615.36s)]
*  They will be sorry, says a public servant who, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=619.12s)]
*  whatever you think of his choices, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=621.4s)]
*  has been found across multiple investigations [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=623.32s)]
*  to be an honest public servant. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=625.84s)]
*  And he's looked down both roads, even [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=628.44s)]
*  when he had a duty to work for Trump [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=630.76s)]
*  best he could because he had a tenure FBI term. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=632.36s)]
*  He's looked down both roads. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=635.76s)]
*  And for the groups, but the power and the money, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  the better road, even by self-interest alone, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=640.84s)]
*  is holding your ground and fighting, says Mr. Comey. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=643.68s)]
*  And the record shows, so far, that has been more successful. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=647.08s)]
*  I'll leave this up for a moment. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=650.76s)]
*  Some of these are logos you may or may not know, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=652.76s)]
*  but Harvard you know, and the other law firms [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=654.72s)]
*  are the ones who said, we'll fight. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=657.0s)]
*  So far, they're winning. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=658.76s)]
*  And others capitulated from tech bros worried about jail time [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=660.16s)]
*  who are still being hassled to some of those other entities [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=664.24s)]
*  and bankers and groups. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=667.52s)]
*  Now, I also want to add one more point. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=670.0s)]
*  This idea of whether you pay lawyers and fight and go for it [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=673.0s)]
*  is not relevant for everyone. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=676.1999999999999s)]
*  There are people who are isolated, people without money [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=679.12s)]
*  to hire a lawyer, let alone a team of lawyers. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=682.28s)]
*  They're just more in survival mode. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=685.4s)]
*  But for those big organizations, the big businesses, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=687.92s)]
*  the rich elites, the law firms I mentioned, for them, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=691.3199999999999s)]
*  the evidence suggests in these first 120 days, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=695.0s)]
*  fighting back is not just a way to be true to yourselves, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  the career you've chosen. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=701.68s)]
*  It also looks like the more victorious strategy. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtBTRbZ_Mo&t=703.5999999999999s)]
