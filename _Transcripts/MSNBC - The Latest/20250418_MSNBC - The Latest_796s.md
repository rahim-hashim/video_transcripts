# Trump's authoritarian push stumbles as resistance diversifies and grows
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A)
*  I just want to note that the courts are not riding alone here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=0.0s)]
*  This stuff does not happen in a vacuum. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=5.96s)]
*  You ask scholars of authoritarianism and dictatorship, and they will tell you that it's never just [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=8.22s)]
*  one thing that works in terms of resistance. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  It's everything together. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=16.48s)]
*  And in our country, specifically on this issue, at the sort of sharp end of the stick here [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=19.76s)]
*  on immigration, we really are seeing all kinds of resistance and strategic refusal and sounding [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=24.16s)]
*  the alarm all happening all at once. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=30.92s)]
*  And it is mutually reinforcing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=33.08s)]
*  When you start seeing it come from all directions, it feeds on itself. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=35.36s)]
*  It gains momentum. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=38.76s)]
*  It gets bigger. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=39.76s)]
*  And right now it is everywhere. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=41.0s)]
*  It is in the courts. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  It is also in communities. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=44.08s)]
*  It is in civic life. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=45.36s)]
*  It is in political life. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=46.36s)]
*  It is in the press. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=47.36s)]
*  And it is in the streets. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=48.6s)]
*  And I mean that all very specifically and literally. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=50.32s)]
*  This is St. Paul, Minnesota, yesterday, outside the Consulate of El Salvador in St. Paul. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=53.6s)]
*  People in the streets lining both sides of the road demanding that the Trump administration [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=58.36s)]
*  follow the court's orders and bring back Kilmar Abrego-Garcia and bring back these [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  men they have shipped to that foreign prison. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=66.4s)]
*  This was Santa Rosa, California, yesterday. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=69.18s)]
*  Local clergy leading a rally in support of immigrants and against what Trump is doing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  This was Denver, Colorado, yesterday. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=75.22s)]
*  Again, local clergy leading a protest, a rally in support of immigrants and against the Trump [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  administration's treatment of immigrants. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=81.08s)]
*  This was Grand Rapids, Michigan, yesterday. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=84.24s)]
*  Local people protesting against Trump administration plans to open an immigration prison, a so-called [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=86.34s)]
*  detention facility in their community. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=92.0s)]
*  This was New Orleans, yesterday. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  People protesting at ICE headquarters in New Orleans, Louisiana. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=96.3s)]
*  These students, yesterday, protesting against how they're going against immigrants and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=100.92s)]
*  international students at Kennesaw State, in Cobb County, Georgia, and in Newark, Delaware, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=104.64s)]
*  at the University of Delaware. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=109.4s)]
*  When the Trump administration took a young man who's a legal permanent resident named [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=112.2s)]
*  Mohsen Madhawi in Vermont this week, the community where he lives, where he is absolutely [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=116.2s)]
*  integrated into that community, they sprung into action. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=121.72s)]
*  They were worried that Trump's agents were going to come for him. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=124.88s)]
*  His friends and supporters had created a text group called Mohsen Just in Case to prepare [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=127.56s)]
*  a support plan, a network, a communication in case it happened. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  They were with him when the arrest happened. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=137.32s)]
*  They made sure to film it, to make sure that it was posted on social media, that they alerted [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  the press. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=143.48s)]
*  They had prepared for the worst with lawyers who had prepped in advance legal motions to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=144.48s)]
*  stop him being removed from Vermont and flown to one of these immigration dungeons, for [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=148.88s)]
*  lack of a better word, a thousand miles away in Louisiana or somewhere. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=154.6s)]
*  And because they had those prepped in time, those motions worked. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=159.0s)]
*  A judge was able to order him, kept in Vermont while he was still in Vermont, before they [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=162.0s)]
*  had time to spirit him off elsewhere. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=166.72s)]
*  Vermonters have since been protesting at the prison where he is being held in their state. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=169.32s)]
*  Mr. Madhawi is Palestinian. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=173.6s)]
*  He was born and raised in the West Bank. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=175.68s)]
*  They brought Palestinian flags to show their support for him. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=177.48s)]
*  And they banged drums and yelled as loud as they could in the hopes that he could hear [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=180.12s)]
*  them inside the prison. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=184.12s)]
*  Now in Vermont, the Democratic leadership and the state legislature says they want to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=185.96s)]
*  terminate their state's contract with the federal government to keep immigration prisoners, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=189.76s)]
*  immigration so-called detainees, in the state's prisons, in their own facilities. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=194.64s)]
*  That's Vermont. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  In Raleigh, North Carolina, the Trump administration has just sent notice to two dozen Christians [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=201.72s)]
*  who fled Afghanistan when the Taliban took that country back over. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  They are legally here in this country. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=211.16s)]
*  They were given legal permission to stay here for obvious reasons. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=212.88s)]
*  For not obvious reasons, Donald Trump is now taking that away and telling these Afghan [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  Christians that they have to return immediately to the tender mercies of the Taliban right [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=221.84s)]
*  now this week. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  It is a Christian church in Raleigh, North Carolina that's advocating for them. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=229.39999999999998s)]
*  At the Apostles Church in Raleigh, there's a community of Afghans, many going through [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  the same thing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=237.72s)]
*  Pastor Nick Kamisky says the church has organized resources to help asylum seekers navigate [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  the process. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  It's a very personal issue. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=245.76s)]
*  These are individuals, men, women, children, that we know and have come to know and love. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=247.88s)]
*  That's Raleigh, North Carolina. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=256.44s)]
*  In Utah, it's people who are legally here, legally here, from Haiti and Venezuela, who [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=258.44s)]
*  are part of the community that they live in in Utah, who are beloved there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=264.78s)]
*  Their neighbors in Utah are stepping up to help them and also to sound the alarm. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=270.6s)]
*  It's time for you to leave the United States. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=277.12s)]
*  That's the first line of a letter from the Department of Homeland Security to several [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=279.76s)]
*  refugee families here in Utah legally. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=283.58s)]
*  New Specialist Dan Rascone is covering this story and joins us live. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=286.76s)]
*  Dan, this has left neighbors shocked and upset. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=289.88s)]
*  It really has, Deanie. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=294.52s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=295.76s)]
*  Shocked, upset, angry, and also heartbroken that several of these families got this letter [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=296.76s)]
*  from the Department of Homeland Security telling them they got to be out of this country [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=302.56s)]
*  by the end of the week. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=307.08s)]
*  I'm angry. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm sad. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm embarrassed. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  Emotions running high. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  It's not right. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=313.88s)]
*  It's inhumane. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=315.52s)]
*  For this group of neighbors in Mill Creek. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  We love them and they love us. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=319.22s)]
*  Gathered together to fight for three refugee families. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=321.52s)]
*  I feel sad, really sad. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=324.28s)]
*  That arrived in the U.S. and in their area not long ago. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=327.08s)]
*  All of them getting this letter from the Department of Homeland Security saying, quote, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=330.56s)]
*  it's time for you to leave the United States. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=334.48s)]
*  Your parole will terminate in seven days. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=337.4s)]
*  Unimaginable. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=340.32s)]
*  The government that we love would do this to people we love. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=341.32s)]
*  Honestly, feel like family to us. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=344.8s)]
*  Two of the families are from Venezuela, the other from Haiti, all too scared to identify [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=346.8s)]
*  themselves. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=352.04s)]
*  The letters say that I was supposed to leave. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=353.04s)]
*  This mother from Haiti has a two-year-old daughter. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=356.04s)]
*  I wasn't shocked because I wasn't expected something like that to happen because I came [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=358.44s)]
*  here legally. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=365.76s)]
*  Attorney Jim McConkie with the Refugee Justice League is helping the families get representation. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=366.92s)]
*  We're dealing with a group of people that are here legally. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=372.52s)]
*  And the letters that were sent intentionally are designed to bully and mislead these people [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=376.88s)]
*  into believing that they don't have rights. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=384.22s)]
*  That's Utah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=389.14000000000004s)]
*  That's Mill Creek, Utah. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=390.14000000000004s)]
*  Those neighbors standing up for their neighbors who have been taken. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=391.86s)]
*  It's protests. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=395.94000000000005s)]
*  It's community life. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=397.46000000000004s)]
*  It's also civic life. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=398.62s)]
*  These students at Harvard today rallying to support international students at Harvard, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=400.04s)]
*  who the Trump administration is threatening as a group, threatening en masse as their [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=404.70000000000005s)]
*  own university, one of the highest profile and most prestigious universities in the world, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=409.70000000000005s)]
*  takes a firm stand against the administration and says they will not accede to Trump's demands. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=414.18s)]
*  We're going to have more on that coming up in just a moment. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=418.58000000000004s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=422.02000000000004s)]
*  If you look just outside Harvard Yard, if you look at the hometown press in Boston, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=423.02000000000004s)]
*  you will see not only standing ovation level support for Harvard choosing to wage that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=428.98s)]
*  fight, you will also see in the biggest local paper, the Boston Globe, you'll see them [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=434.3s)]
*  today leading with a brand new investigative piece into these vigilante groups that have [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=439.0s)]
*  been claiming credit for feeding individual student names to the Trump administration [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=444.76s)]
*  for the administration to then target those people for arrest and deportation. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=450.0s)]
*  The Globe's investigation today reviewed a so-called students deport list from one [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=454.44s)]
*  of these groups. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=459.8s)]
*  Quote, it sometimes placed students at the wrong universities or featured people who [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=460.8s)]
*  were not even in the United States. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=464.74s)]
*  One woman on the list was pictured wearing a hijab and identified as a Harvard student [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=466.96s)]
*  from Nigeria who had already been detained in Massachusetts. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=471.47999999999996s)]
*  The group claimed she should be deported because her visa had been revoked in March for a pro-Hamas [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=475.52s)]
*  rally speech. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=480.52s)]
*  Contacted by the Globe, the woman said she has never attended a pro-Hamas rally, she [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=482.4s)]
*  has never attended Harvard, and in fact, she has never visited the United States. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=486.78s)]
*  An hour south in New Bedford, Massachusetts, the local NBC station, Channel 10, has dug [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=493.64s)]
*  into this horrifying video in which ICE agents smashed through the window of a car to drag [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=498.08s)]
*  a man and a woman out of the vehicle. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=503.64s)]
*  They report that the ICE agents repeatedly, while they were doing this, referred to the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=506.38s)]
*  man in the car as Antonio. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=510.56s)]
*  They insisted that that was what his name and it was Antonio who they were looking for. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=512.28s)]
*  Nobody in that car was named Antonio. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=517.0s)]
*  It really does appear to be a case of mistaken identity. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=519.88s)]
*  Local press has been covering it intensely while ICE is defending its conduct by saying [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=523.7s)]
*  whether or not he's Antonio, the man was not in the country legally and so, you know. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=529.28s)]
*  The New Republic was first to report that one of the police officers responsible for [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=536.04s)]
*  the disputed gang designation for Kilmar Abrego Garcia appears to have himself been soon thereafter [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=539.42s)]
*  the police force for serious misconduct in an unrelated matter, which of course goes [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=547.2s)]
*  to a police officer's credibility on a matter like this. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=552.4200000000001s)]
*  USA Today was first to report that in the case of the gay makeup artist who the Trump [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=556.36s)]
*  administration sent to El Salvador potentially for life in prison, his supposed gang affiliation [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=560.36s)]
*  was due to a single officer with a history of serious credibility and disciplinary problems, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=566.6s)]
*  including driving his car into a family's home while intoxicated, after which he was [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=571.96s)]
*  summarily fired. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=576.44s)]
*  Now we've got increasing press coverage of the Trump administration sending get out of [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  the country immediately letters to at least three US citizens, two of whom are lawyers [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=583.72s)]
*  in Massachusetts and one of whom is a random doctor in Connecticut. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=588.6s)]
*  All of them American citizens, all inexplicably told by the Trump administration that they [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=592.2s)]
*  must get out of the country within a week. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=596.46s)]
*  And all of this press coverage, while it's depressing because of the subject matter, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=601.8s)]
*  it is also incisive investigative press coverage. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=606.92s)]
*  And it does have the effect of exposing the shambolic and slapdash and utterly incompetent [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=611.0799999999999s)]
*  behavior of the Trump administration as it embarks on this cruel and unconstitutional [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=617.3599999999999s)]
*  adventure for which it wants to be feared and respected. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=621.5999999999999s)]
*  And instead they look ridiculous and cruel and equal measure. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=625.5s)]
*  And that has the effect of shaping public opinion about what they're doing. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=629.56s)]
*  And that fuels not just protests and lots of them, but also lawsuits. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=633.2399999999999s)]
*  Reuters reporting that on Tuesday alone this week, federal judges in at least seven states [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=638.2399999999999s)]
*  issued orders blocking the Trump administration from acting against international students [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=643.16s)]
*  that it is trying to arrest. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=648.5999999999999s)]
*  Lawsuits in Massachusetts, Montana, Wisconsin, Washington, D.C., New Hampshire, Michigan, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=650.4399999999999s)]
*  everywhere and more filed every single day. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=655.04s)]
*  Those legal roadblocks tend to turn up information. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=659.06s)]
*  The tide of incisive investigative press about what the administration is doing turns up [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=662.14s)]
*  yet more information about what Trump is doing and who he's hurting. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=666.5999999999999s)]
*  And all of that information builds the public case, further galvanizes more public opinion [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=672.02s)]
*  against them and more protest against them. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=678.7399999999999s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=680.8599999999999s)]
*  If you keep eventually going like this, this stuff snowballs and it builds on itself and [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=681.8599999999999s)]
*  eventually you are going to embolden elected emboldened elected officials to make them [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=685.8s)]
*  believe that it is time they better take action. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=691.92s)]
*  And eventually you are going to end up with a U.S. senator in El Salvador himself trying [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=694.4399999999999s)]
*  to get his constituent out of there. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=699.24s)]
*  And on that front, we have breaking news tonight. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=704.8s)]
*  Just as we are getting on the air tonight, we have learned that Senator Chris Van Hollen, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=706.78s)]
*  has been able to meet with imprisoned Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the government of El Salvador, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=712.56s)]
*  posting three photos online of the senator meeting with Mr. Abrego Garcia. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=717.8399999999999s)]
*  A short time later, Senator Van Hollen confirming that he did have a chance to meet with his [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=721.7199999999999s)]
*  constituent. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=725.5999999999999s)]
*  He said, quote, I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar tonight. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=726.5999999999999s)]
*  I had that chance. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=730.0799999999999s)]
*  I've called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=731.16s)]
*  I look forward to providing a full update upon my return. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=735.16s)]
*  It is unclear where that meeting took place. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=739.68s)]
*  It is unclear what Mr. Garcia's Mr. Abrego Garcia's current status is. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=741.5600000000001s)]
*  We are working on getting more information from Senator Van Hollen's office. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=745.08s)]
*  We will bring it to you as we get it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=748.68s)]
*  But no, you know, none of these things on their own is enough. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=753.08s)]
*  But all of them together, really something, and all of them together just might be enough, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=758.12s)]
*  right? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=762.68s)]
*  One of my land, two of my sea, fast horses, a relay of riders to alert everybody along [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=763.6800000000001s)]
*  the way, everybody ready to do their part. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=768.84s)]
*  We've had 250 years of training for this. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  We know what to do. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1z0ggh32A&t=774.0400000000001s)]
