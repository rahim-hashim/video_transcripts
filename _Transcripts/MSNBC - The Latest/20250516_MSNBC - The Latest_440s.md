# Hegseth is all about 'out-Trumping Trump': National Guard requested to help at border
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU)
*  Crossings at the southern border are dramatically down, partially because of moves President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden made at the end of his term, but now down even more because of Donald Trump, who [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=4.98s)]
*  has made strides to militarize the border. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=9.9s)]
*  The New York Times reports, in addition to the nearly 9,000 active-duty combat troops [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=13.18s)]
*  already patrolling, DHS is requesting 20,000 more National Guardsmen. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=17.14s)]
*  But while the president is enjoying decent approval numbers, what remains of them, for [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=23.54s)]
*  the crackdown at the border, the crackdown on immigrants away from the border is costing [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=27.66s)]
*  him. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=33.14s)]
*  Joining us now, New York Times Pentagon correspondent and NBC News political contributor Helene [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=34.14s)]
*  Cooper and senior editor at the Atlantic, Hannah Rosen, is still with us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=37.96s)]
*  Helene, walk us through the reporting you have on what Donald Trump and what the Department [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=41.54s)]
*  of Homeland Security want now at the border. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  Well, they're looking for 20,000. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=48.54s)]
*  And first, hi, Katie, thanks for having me. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=51.14s)]
*  They're looking for 20,000 extra troops. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=54.14s)]
*  A lot of this is being presented as an effort to crack down on Mexican drug cartels, who, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=57.08s)]
*  according to the Trump administration officials, are coming into this country and bringing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=65.56s)]
*  with them fentanyl and bringing with them drugs. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=69.84s)]
*  And they've been talking about going after these people for quite some time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=73.08s)]
*  And that's why they want the extra troops and they want more of this military hardware. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  But a lot of this is also being deployed at civilians. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=83.76s)]
*  You've seen, you mentioned the number, troop number, 8,600 active duty soldiers who are [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=87.76s)]
*  already down there. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  You also have two naval destroyers, which are in the Gulf of Mexico and right off the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=95.68s)]
*  Pacific, off the coast of California that are hovering by. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  They're using U-2 spy planes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of their drones. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of military and Pentagon hardware that has been deployed to the border as part [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=110.68s)]
*  of this effort to crack down on what one general down there described to us as the generational [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  conflict for this generation. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  This is their mission. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  Sort of like, you know, we had our grandparents' mission was World War II. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=128.16s)]
*  This generation, he said, this military conflict for them was to crack down on immigrants at [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  the border. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=138.32s)]
*  I see it as a military conflict, really. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=139.72s)]
*  Individuals crossing the border. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=142.2s)]
*  Do they see more nefarious stuff going on other than people who are looking for a better life? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=143.48s)]
*  Helene? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=149.44s)]
*  Well, that's such a good question, Katie. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=150.56s)]
*  It's a question of there's what they say and this is what the Trump administration officials [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  say. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=158.12s)]
*  And then there's what the military says privately. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=158.72s)]
*  And you have to make a distinction between these two things. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  The Pentagon historically has been very lukewarm about using active duty troops on the border. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=165.28s)]
*  President Trump in his first term tried it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=175.6s)]
*  Jim Mattis did not. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=178.0s)]
*  His defense secretary at the time did not like it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=179.08s)]
*  President Trump asked for a huge number of troops. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=182.44s)]
*  Mattis responded at first by sending 2100 National Guard troops and making sure that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=185.52s)]
*  they stayed unarmed. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=190.88s)]
*  Back as he was approaching his first midterm elections, President Trump then asked for [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=192.88s)]
*  15000 more. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=197.2s)]
*  Mattis responded by sending 6000. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  The Pentagon doesn't like the idea of this because the military trains to kill people. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=201.4s)]
*  They train in they prize readiness for foreign wars. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=207.04s)]
*  They're trained to kill adversaries and they define that usually as foreign adversaries. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=211.64s)]
*  They do not like to be deployed inside the American border. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=216.96s)]
*  When you think about the fact that you're teaching your military is training to kill, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=221.88000000000002s)]
*  do you really want them deployed on American streets and within the border? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=225.96s)]
*  And that's something the Pentagon historically has not liked. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=230.60000000000002s)]
*  They usually historically don't like the idea of being dragged into what they view as political [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=233.8s)]
*  partisan politics. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  But that's the historic Pentagon. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=242.84s)]
*  Now we have the Trump Pentagon. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  I can tell you that military officials are not crazy about this, but they're also senior [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=247.24s)]
*  defense officials who report to Defense Secretary Pete Hexeth and he is all about out-Trumping [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=259.64s)]
*  So you have to sort of figure out who you're talking to and kind of parse through what [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=260.52000000000004s)]
*  they're saying and what they feel comfortable saying on the record. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and they certainly feel they have a degree of autonomy to move at the or an authority [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=270.44s)]
*  to move at the border because of the poll numbers and Donald Trump's campaign. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  The poll numbers for the border are still above water for Donald Trump, but the poll [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=280.44s)]
*  numbers for everything else are below water and that includes immigration in general, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=285.24s)]
*  partially because, Hannah, what we're seeing away from the border are really difficult [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=289.24s)]
*  and disturbing images like this one, which is I believe it's a daughter who was being [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=296.2s)]
*  pinned down as her mother was detained. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=301.08s)]
*  I mean, you got images of ice hammering through windows like this one to take a husband away [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=303.96s)]
*  from a wife. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=311.88s)]
*  We've heard about the children who were deported with their mother or left with their mother who [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=314.52s)]
*  were getting cancer treatments. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=319.96s)]
*  There was one young girl. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=321.48s)]
*  These are members of a community and a lot of them and a lot of people around them will say, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=323.0s)]
*  this is not what we thought we were voting for. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=327.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=330.44s)]
*  Immigration enforcement turns out to be a delicate political act and lots of presidents [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=331.32s)]
*  learn this anew and Trump is learning it now. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=336.6s)]
*  Americans want border enforcement. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=339.88s)]
*  They don't necessarily want street enforcement, partly because they have experience with [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=342.36s)]
*  immigrants, they're immigrants in their community, and partly because they don't like to think of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=346.92s)]
*  themselves as that kind of nation, as being part of that kind of enforcement, sort of shipping [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=351.0s)]
*  people off to prisons, violating their due process rights. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=357.4s)]
*  So it's a very delicate act and we're seeing it in the poll numbers already where people think, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=360.52s)]
*  oh, maybe you're overreaching here. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=365.16s)]
*  This is not exactly what we asked for. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=367.64s)]
*  Sometimes I like to think of it as control, like what Americans like to see is things being in [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=370.52s)]
*  control. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=375.96s)]
*  So the border sort of fits that, but seeing people smashing in windows or people who are masked, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=376.44s)]
*  stopping young women on the street, that feels out of control and that does not land quite as well. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=381.8s)]
*  Yeah, but I wonder when Donald Trump was at the RNC, I was at the RNC and everybody was holding [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=386.76s)]
*  up signed mass deportations now. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=392.28s)]
*  Stephen Miller was talking about deporting a million immigrants, undocumented immigrants in a year. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=394.68s)]
*  So I'm just, when people say they didn't think they were voting for that, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=400.36s)]
*  where is the disconnect, Hannah? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=403.88s)]
*  I think mass deportation is an abstraction. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=406.12s)]
*  People don't really, when you show somebody mass deportation, and like the images you just showed [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=408.68s)]
*  are very visceral. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=414.44s)]
*  I mean, it's like men in masks knocking down young women. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=415.64s)]
*  And so you can be abstractly for mass deportation. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=419.08s)]
*  You can even sort of like raise your fist for mass deportation at a rally. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=422.44s)]
*  But if you see a picture of what mass deportation looks like in its gory details, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=426.36s)]
*  maybe you feel a little uncomfortable. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=431.48s)]
*  You don't necessarily want to be a part of that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=433.16s)]
*  Yeah, Hannah Rosen, Helene Cooper. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=435.64000000000004s)]
*  Ladies, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ir0SRK4lNU&t=438.12s)]
