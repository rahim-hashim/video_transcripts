# The Weekend hosts debut their viewer questions segment and get a special surprise
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM)
*  We'll be real scared right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=0.0s)]
*  We wanted to try something a little different [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=1.72s)]
*  on our new show. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Viewers, we want to hear from you [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=5.16s)]
*  if you have questions for us about news, politics, culture. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=7.16s)]
*  Want to know which position you played, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=21.96s)]
*  which was your favorite play to run, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=23.84s)]
*  and what being a collegiate athlete taught you [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=25.72s)]
*  about working on a team. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  Hi, I love you, Alicia. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=30.24s)]
*  I was a 2-3-4, depending on the year, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=35.04s)]
*  and just how much muscle milk I had. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=40.08s)]
*  As like a 3-4, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=45.6s)]
*  specialist. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=48.36s)]
*  I wish I could remember the plays that we were running. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=50.24s)]
*  You know it's real because she's talking [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  and the basketball talk, and I know Jonathan's lost. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  You know what, it's total, it's like Latin. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=57.76s)]
*  But number one lesson is act as if, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=60.72s)]
*  never let them see you sweat, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=64.4s)]
*  and also nothing is ever going to be as early [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=65.76s)]
*  as waking up and crossing the river [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=68.28s)]
*  to get to weightlifting at 4.45 a.m. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=70.76s)]
*  So this show feels like a cakewalk. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=73.2s)]
*  Our next question features a viewer from Nebraska. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=77.36s)]
*  Oh, I know who this is. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  Hi, Eugene. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=84.24s)]
*  Long time listener, first time caller. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=85.28s)]
*  I am really interested in, I hear you got a dog recently. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=88.4s)]
*  So what is it like now being a dog parent, new job? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=91.44s)]
*  What's the routine, and what kind of dog do you have? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=94.24s)]
*  I'm trying to get my husband to buy me a dog, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=96.56s)]
*  and I'm just hoping that I can show him this clip [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=98.0s)]
*  and you can help encourage us to add to our family. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=100.24s)]
*  Help us to sound. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=104.12s)]
*  Look, Sean, get this woman a dog, please. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  Get this woman a dog. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=107.52s)]
*  So our dog's name is Ovi, O-B-I-E, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=108.8s)]
*  not O-B-1, Kenobi, O-B-I-E. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=112.0s)]
*  He's very sweet, but he's gotten to the biting phase. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=114.4s)]
*  He's attacking me and my husband. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=116.64s)]
*  What is the routine? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  There's not much of one, because we're still learning. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=119.64s)]
*  So we take him out, he uses the bathroom a little bit, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  and then he just runs and terrorizes us, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  and then he falls asleep on your lap like this, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  and then you let him all over again. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=129.24s)]
*  He uses the bathroom a little bit, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  not just all the way. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't use it all the time. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=133.32s)]
*  He's very concerned. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=135.28s)]
*  Okay, let's just stop. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=136.12s)]
*  But we love him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=137.12s)]
*  And finally, our last question comes [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  from a native Maryland viewer. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=141.32s)]
*  Who could this be? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=144.12s)]
*  A Republican. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  Hello. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=147.32s)]
*  I'm Michael, and I'm a little nervous, but I'm excited. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=149.0s)]
*  This one's for Jonathan Capehart. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  Jonathan, you are fine. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=156.2s)]
*  You look so good all the time. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=159.76s)]
*  I just, dude, what's your secret? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  Where do you get your car? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=166.44s)]
*  Is it Hermes or is it Hermes? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=167.88s)]
*  You gotta help a brother out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=170.76s)]
*  I just look forward to your insights [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=172.56s)]
*  as you pull all of this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=174.84s)]
*  Dude, really, I'm so nervous, but I'm so excited. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=176.96s)]
*  But is it, what, the piece? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=180.8s)]
*  Look, I'm working on the pocket square. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=183.2s)]
*  That's called the pocket square. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=184.76s)]
*  Do more of that, and share. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  Okay, so Michael Steele of Maryland. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=189.04s)]
*  Yes, this is a pocket square, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=192.16s)]
*  and the pocket square is from Charvet. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=194.0s)]
*  This is obviously a tie. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=196.16s)]
*  It's from Hermes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=199.16s)]
*  Hermes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=201.44s)]
*  The blazer is from Brunello Cuccinelli, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=202.92s)]
*  and the shirt is from Turnbull and Asser. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=206.48s)]
*  And basically, anyone who's watched me on television [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=210.08s)]
*  knows I basically only have two colors, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=213.04s)]
*  navy blue and charcoal gray. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=215.6s)]
*  But for our premiere show, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=218.16s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=220.04s)]
*  I figured I'd go in an homage to someone [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=220.88s)]
*  who used to live in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=224.44s)]
*  put on my tan blazer for this, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=227.24s)]
*  our auspicious moment, you know, to brighten it up. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=230.6s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=234.12s)]
*  You know, this is, yeah. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=234.96s)]
*  New time. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=236.96s)]
*  So Michael, we'll go shopping. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  We've threatened to do this for years. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=240.92s)]
*  Michael Steele and I have threatened [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=242.76s)]
*  to go shopping together, and it would just be a riot. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=244.2s)]
*  We could have a camera crew with us [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  and take us around, it'd be nuts. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  I do have viewers offering to take me shopping, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=252.4s)]
*  so we'll do that after the show. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=254.44s)]
*  But that was fabulous, almost as fabulous [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=256.84s)]
*  as Jonathan's outfit. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=258.8s)]
*  Thank you so much, Alicia, Menendez, our predecessors, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=260.04s)]
*  Michael Steele, Simone, Sanders, Townsend. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=262.68s)]

*  on The Weeknight, which premieres Monday [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=267.36s)]
*  at 7 p.m. Eastern on MSNBC. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=269.44s)]
*  Watch it, everyone. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=272.32s)]
*  Before we go, there's no such thing as a bad question. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=273.8s)]
*  So if any of you longtime listeners [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=277.4s)]
*  would also like to be our first time callers, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=279.88s)]
*  go to our social media at The Weeknd on all platforms [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=282.36s)]
*  and comment on our pinned mailbag posts [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=286.04s)]

*  Feel free to ask. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88c_4gvisM&t=291.4s)]
