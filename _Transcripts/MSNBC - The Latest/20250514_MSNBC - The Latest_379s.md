# Will the Supreme Court boost Trump's power? Birthright citizenship dispute has broader implications
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM)
*  The president's agenda and the future of birthright citizenship are on the line tomorrow in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=0.0s)]
*  high-stakes arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=5.38s)]
*  We will bring those to you live. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=8.74s)]
*  At issue here is not birthright citizenship itself, but instead the question of the power [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=10.88s)]
*  of the lower courts and whether they have the judicial authority to issue a nationwide [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=15.92s)]
*  ban on Trump's move to end the constitutionally guaranteed right, a question that could have [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  widespread implications. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=26.76s)]
*  And joining us now is Cecilia Wong. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=28.8s)]
*  She's the national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU was the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=31.16s)]
*  first to file a lawsuit against the Trump's administration move to end birthright citizenship. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=36.68s)]
*  However, they're not part of this specific case that's appearing before the Supreme Court. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=42.2s)]
*  Cecilia, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=46.64s)]
*  Again, just to- [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  A pleasure. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  Thank you, Sma. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  Just want to emphasize that the Supreme Court's not actually hearing arguments on the merits [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  here about whether President Trump can end birthright citizenship through this executive [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=55.36s)]
*  order. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=59.76s)]
*  Instead, the issue before the court has to do with the power of the lower court and the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=60.76s)]
*  judge to issue nationwide injunctions. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=65.6s)]
*  Can you explain further? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=68.6s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=69.6s)]
*  This is an issue that's been brewing in a number of cases that have been brought against [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=70.6s)]
*  the U.S. government across various administrations. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=75.72s)]
*  But what's interesting about this particular case as it's teed up for argument in the Supreme [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=79.64s)]
*  Court tomorrow is that the Trump administration is complaining essentially that three different [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=84.26s)]
*  federal appeals courts have permitted lower court injunctions to go into basically blocking [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=91.14s)]
*  the president's unconstitutional and illegal birthright citizenship order. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=99.22s)]
*  And Trump is saying in the Supreme Court, I'm complaining here that the federal judiciary [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  And the lower courts of the United States are blocking my policies from going into effect. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=111.94s)]
*  And he calls out in his brief that there are more court injunctions against his administration [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=119.3s)]
*  than other administrations. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=124.9s)]
*  Well, he skips over the obvious fact that the reason for that is that the Trump administration [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=126.7s)]
*  is implementing so many unconstitutional and blatantly illegal policies. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=134.14s)]
*  And so this is an interesting case because the Supreme Court, for a few years now, has [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=140.45999999999998s)]
*  been interested in the idea of so-called universal injunctions. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=145.66s)]
*  And it's teed up in a situation where it's an immigration issue. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=150.82s)]
*  It's in fact a nationality issue where the Constitution says not only that everyone born [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=155.14s)]
*  in the United States is by birth a United States citizen, but also that there should [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  be uniformity in issues of nationality and immigration. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=167.42s)]
*  So I think that the court is going to be looking at a particular context for issues of so-called [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=172.33999999999997s)]
*  universal injunctions where the headwinds are really against the U.S. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  government here, against the executive branch. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=183.1s)]
*  Has the Supreme Court ever weighed in on the power of lower courts? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=185.7s)]
*  Again, we're talking about federal courts, federal judges. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=188.7s)]
*  And could they change the range of those judges' power? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=192.1s)]
*  I think what's critical for people to understand is that these issues that the executive branch [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=197.66s)]
*  is raising, that the Trump administration is raising here, really should be looked at [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=204.14s)]
*  on a case-by-case basis. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=208.82s)]
*  So the Trump administration is trying to, again, attack the federal judiciary and the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=211.45999999999998s)]
*  notion of checks and balances against the unconstitutional use of executive power here [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=218.66s)]
*  to try to override the Constitution and, in fact, the Reconstruction Constitution through [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=225.42s)]
*  executive fiat, through executive order. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=231.18s)]
*  But if you look at this on a case-by-case basis, as the courts must, as I said, I think [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=233.62s)]
*  that we now have orders that 22 states have won blocking the president's executive order, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=239.78s)]
*  blatantly unconstitutional, from going into effect. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=247.26s)]
*  And I think the question the Supreme Court is looking at here is a really important one. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=250.62s)]
*  Do you want to have a situation where in 22 states you have one rule that comports with [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=256.02s)]
*  the U.S. Constitution, or do you want to have, and in the other states, the president's order [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=263.94s)]
*  can go into effect? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=269.9s)]
*  As the states proved and as the organizations and individuals who have challenged the birthright [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=271.74s)]
*  citizenship order have proved in court, those injuries are nationwide. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=277.70000000000005s)]
*  There are so many people who have been harmed by the president's executive order on birthright [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=283.18s)]
*  citizenship. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=288.58000000000004s)]
*  We have to have a uniform rule. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=289.66s)]
*  And I do think that the Supreme Court, this is not the case in which the Supreme Court [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=291.42s)]
*  should announce any new rules about so-called universal injunctions. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=297.1s)]
*  If the president of the United States is implementing a policy that is blatantly unconstitutional, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=301.9s)]
*  the federal courts do have the power, if they've got the right plaintiff in front of them, to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=308.54s)]
*  block that president's action nationwide. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=313.5s)]
*  And they do have that power here. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=316.78s)]
*  They had the right plaintiffs coming in 22 states, numerous organizations with members in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=318.78s)]
*  every single state, and individuals, expectant parents, who are deeply harmed by this order. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=324.1s)]
*  So I think this is not the case for the Supreme Court to disturb the existing pace law that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=330.5s)]
*  holds the executive branch to account when they do something that's blatantly unconstitutional. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=337.02000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=341.14000000000004s)]
*  We'll be able to hear those arguments for ourselves and see what each side says tomorrow [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=342.14000000000004s)]
*  and how the Supreme Court proceeds with this issue and its potential implications in the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=348.26s)]
*  trickle down following it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=353.98s)]
*  Thank you so much, Cecilia Wong, for laying the groundwork for us. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=355.78000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-4u_J6VSM&t=360.42s)]
