# Exclusive: Senator Chris Van Hollen talks with Rachel Maddow live from El Salvador
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig)
*  The prison in El Salvador, where Kilmar Abrego Garcia was sent, the Trump administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=0.0s)]
*  says by mistake, is one of the largest maximum-security prisons in Latin America. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=5.24s)]
*  In recent weeks, that prison has become a kind of photo-op for members of the Trump [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=11.98s)]
*  administration and his Republican supporters in the U.S. Congress. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=16.1s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem toured the prison in March, posting an Abu Ghraib-style [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=20.44s)]
*  video and photos of herself in front of a crowded cell. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=25.6s)]
*  This week, Republican Congressman Jason Smith of Missouri posted his own photo from inside [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=29.82s)]
*  the prison in El Salvador. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=34.88s)]
*  So did Republican Congressman Riley Moore of West Virginia, who shared this photo. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=36.74s)]
*  Double thumbs up in front of the cells of the prison. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=41.1s)]
*  Today, another lawmaker arrived in El Salvador, this time a Democrat, and he's there for [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=44.78s)]
*  a very different reason. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=48.72s)]
*  He is the senior senator from the state where Kilmar Abrego Garcia lived with his family [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=49.86s)]
*  until the Trump administration had him arrested and took him to this foreign prison. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  And to move the administration again, admitted, was what they called an administrative error. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=59.02s)]
*  Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland landed in El Salvador today with the hope [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=65.22s)]
*  that he might see Mr. Abrego Garcia or be able to talk to him. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=69.66s)]
*  I hope to meet with some high-level government officials from El Salvador. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=75.74000000000001s)]
*  As I've said before, the goal of my visit is to talk to people here about the release [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=87.5s)]
*  I told his wife and his family I would do everything possible to bring him home, and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=89.98s)]
*  we're going to keep working at this until we're successful. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=96.5s)]
*  I also hope to have the chance to meet with him, but we'll have a better idea if that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=99.14s)]
*  works out a little later on. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=103.66s)]
*  Senator Van Hollen landing in El Salvador today hoping for a chance to meet with Kilmar [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=107.42s)]
*  Abrego Garcia in that prison. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=110.58000000000001s)]
*  Senator Van Hollen says the vice president of El Salvador told him he would not be able [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=113.02000000000001s)]
*  to do that when he met with him today. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=116.89999999999999s)]
*  Joining us now for the interview is Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who joins us [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=118.98s)]
*  from El Salvador. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=122.58s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for what you're doing and for being here with us tonight. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=123.58s)]
*  I know it's been a very long day. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=128.06s)]
*  It has, Rachel, but as you said in the intro, I promised Kilmar's family that I would do [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=131.7s)]
*  everything I could to bring him home, because, as you said, a court in the United States [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=138.1s)]
*  has determined that he was illegally abducted from the United States and landed in the most [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=144.18s)]
*  notorious prison in El Salvador. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=150.78s)]
*  So that's why I raised these issues directly with the vice president of El Salvador. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=154.78s)]
*  The president is not in the country now, so I met with the vice president to talk about [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=158.78s)]
*  these issues and ask for the opportunity to go visit Kilmar. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=163.3s)]
*  What sort of the range of potential outcomes here that you think are possible? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=170.10000000000002s)]
*  What are you hoping to accomplish on this trip, and how did those expectations match [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=176.86s)]
*  up with the experience that you had today meeting with the country's vice president [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  and hearing what you did from him? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=185.58s)]
*  Well, my goal is to keep a spotlight on this issue until justice is done, until the nine-to-nothing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  opinion by the Supreme Court is implemented by the Trump administration, which is ignoring [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=196.5s)]
*  entirely that order that they need to facilitate his return. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=203.58s)]
*  I asked the folks at the embassy whether they'd been ordered by the administration to do anything [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=207.7s)]
*  to facilitate his return. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=213.22s)]
*  The answer was no, so they're clearly not in compliance. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=214.94s)]
*  And I said to the vice president of El Salvador, look, you've got somebody in your worst prison, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=218.42000000000002s)]
*  a prison for terrorists, who the United States court has said has committed no crime. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=225.89999999999998s)]
*  And so I asked him if he had any evidence that Kilmar was a member of MS-13 or had committed [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=232.82s)]
*  any crimes, and he said no. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=238.26s)]
*  So I asked him why he was keeping Kilmar in prison here, and his answer was that essentially [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=240.83999999999997s)]
*  the Trump administration is paying the government of El Salvador taxpayer money to keep this [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=247.42s)]
*  person here despite the court orders. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=253.7s)]
*  So my goal, Rachel, is to make sure that we keep the spotlight on this issue, because [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=257.42s)]
*  I think it's unsustainable. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=263.82s)]
*  It's unsustainable to continue to keep a person who has not been convicted of a crime in the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=265.58s)]
*  worst prison in El Salvador when the Trump administration admitted itself to a judge [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=272.7s)]
*  that this was a mistake. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=277.98s)]
*  But instead of fixing the mistake, they fired the Justice Department lawyer who admitted [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=279.26s)]
*  it was a mistake. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=284.06s)]
*  I just want to underscore what you just said there, that you were told by the U.S. Embassy [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=286.06s)]
*  in El Salvador that they have received no request from the White House or from the Justice [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  Department, from any other entity in Washington, asking them to take any steps to obtain the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=294.92s)]
*  release of Mr. Abrego-Garcia. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=301.26s)]
*  Presumably it's the local U.S. officials at the embassy there who would be the relevant [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=302.9s)]
*  point of contact, the first point of contact for the U.S. government trying to attain that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=308.18s)]
*  outcome, correct? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=312.14s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=313.9s)]
*  And it is pretty clear that the Trump administration has not lifted a finger to implement that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=317.18s)]
*  court order. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=323.94s)]
*  And so I think it's important that the courts know that, and they will know that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=325.5s)]
*  And again, denying his family an opportunity to even have a phone call with Kilmar is just [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=330.41999999999996s)]
*  a gross violation of basic human rights and human decency. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=337.62s)]
*  And I asked the vice president if I came back next week, whether or not I could go visit [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=342.7s)]
*  Kilmar. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=348.06s)]
*  And the answer was no, he couldn't guarantee that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=349.06s)]
*  I said, look, I may be the first member of Congress here, the first senator, but I can [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=352.14000000000004s)]
*  assure you more will be coming. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=356.70000000000005s)]
*  And you cannot continue to keep this man locked up in this worst prison in El Salvador and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=359.22s)]
*  one of the worst in the hemisphere when he hasn't committed a crime. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=367.7s)]
*  And so we're going to keep at this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=373.09999999999997s)]
*  And I asked the vice president just to let him out the gate, because you may remember [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=375.9s)]
*  at the White House, the president of El Salvador said, well, you know, we can't smuggle Kilmar [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=380.94s)]
*  back into the United States. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  I said, you don't have to smuggle him back to the United States. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=388.53999999999996s)]
*  We know you can't do that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=391.74s)]
*  Just open the prison door. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=393.46s)]
*  And Attorney General Pambandi said the United States would send a plane down here. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=395.82s)]
*  And if she doesn't, at least he would be free for now in El Salvador as we work to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=401.78s)]
*  find a way to get him back into the court system and due process in the United States. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=406.5s)]
*  Again, nothing. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=411.65999999999997s)]
*  You mentioned that other— [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=412.65999999999997s)]
*  So— [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=414.34s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=415.34s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=416.34s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=417.34s)]
*  I didn't mean to interrupt. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=418.34s)]
*  No. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=419.34s)]
*  I think you—I mean, this is, of course, about the family and making sure the family [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=420.34s)]
*  gets justice. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=427.29999999999995s)]
*  But it's also, as you say, about the Trump administration trying to deprive individuals [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=429.17999999999995s)]
*  of the United States of their liberty without any due process, right? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=435.85999999999996s)]
*  This is like taking away people's freedom. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=439.29999999999995s)]
*  That does not sound like a conservative idea to me. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=442.05999999999995s)]
*  That is something that, of course, authoritarian governments engage in. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=447.02s)]
*  And it's a very fast road to tyranny if we don't all stand up against it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=450.18s)]
*  You mentioned the possibility. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=456.5s)]
*  Now, it seems like the likelihood that other members of Congress are going to make their [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=458.34s)]
*  way to El Salvador. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=462.26s)]
*  Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has expressed interest in going. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=464.14s)]
*  Congressman Maxwell Frost, the young congressman from Florida, has formally requested a congressional [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=467.85999999999996s)]
*  delegation, a CODEL, to El Salvador. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=472.46s)]
*  Given that a couple of Republican members of Congress who are supporters of what Trump [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=476.02000000000004s)]
*  has done using this prison have somehow gotten into the prison and been able to take photo [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=479.98s)]
*  ops there, given that the Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem, was able to get in [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=484.26s)]
*  and do a photo op there, I wonder what you make of the El Salvadoran government sort [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=489.02000000000004s)]
*  of opening the door to allow Trump administration officials and Republican supporters of President [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=494.74s)]
*  Trump in there to do—to make, essentially, social media content while still denying you [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=499.82s)]
*  the opportunity to get inside? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=505.3s)]
*  Well, you're right. That's clearly what's happening. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=508.5s)]
*  I mean, you have the government of El Salvador, the president of El Salvador, make this deal [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=510.38s)]
*  with the Trump administration. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=515.1800000000001s)]

*  they ultimately will have to let him go. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=556.5s)]
*  I just I believe that will be the case, because I believe people will keep pressing for [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=559.42s)]
*  justice. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRgr3G21Ig&t=564.82s)]
