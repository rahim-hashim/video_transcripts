# Trump's people fall apart under heavy questioning from Senate Democrats
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I)
*  There are some things that happened on Capitol Hill today that I need to show you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=0.0s)]
*  One of them is a moment from a hearing involving Secretary of State Marco Rubio, that guy, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=5.4s)]
*  who became what seems to be the latest Trump official to deploy the strategy of what I [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=10.68s)]
*  can only call complete ignorance when asked about Trump's controversies. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=15.52s)]
*  It's not your understanding that the plane ultimately will belong to the president or [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=21.52s)]
*  to the president's library after? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=25.04s)]
*  Well, I don't... [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  I'm not involved at that level of it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  I've never heard that before. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=29.88s)]
*  The president has offered access to him to the 200 top purchasers of his meme coin. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=30.88s)]
*  Do you have a list of those foreign individuals who will be meeting with the president? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=39.04s)]
*  I don't. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=44.88s)]
*  I don't know anything about it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  I didn't even know there was a dinner on Thursday night. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Isn't that a relevant question for the Secretary of State? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not the social secretary. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=51.6s)]
*  Which foreign interests are going to be speaking to the president? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=52.6s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of naive to believe that they aren't going to be in that room talking [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  about national security matters. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=57.84s)]
*  Well, I don't think that that's the case at all because I would be aware if it was the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=59.32s)]
*  case. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=62.24s)]
*  You're asking about a dinner I don't know anything about. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=63.24s)]
*  I can't answer you because I don't know anything about this dinner. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=64.24s)]
*  It's the first I heard of it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=66.6s)]
*  He knows nothing about it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=69.92s)]
*  It's the first he's heard of it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=71.28s)]
*  Somehow. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=73.08s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy, who you just saw there obviously questioning Secretary Rubio, will [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=74.08s)]
*  join me here later this hour. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=78.0s)]
*  I can't wait to talk to him about what went down there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=79.56s)]
*  I bet he's pretty skeptical that the Secretary of State had heard nothing about any of that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=81.88s)]
*  We're all skeptical of that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=87.76s)]
*  But Secretary Rubio was also not the only Trump official trying to plead ignorance. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=89.2s)]
*  I guess that's the strategy now about Trump's most outlandish and potentially illegal plans. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=94.44s)]
*  Because today, former Congressman Billy Long, Trump's nominee to run the IRS, was also in [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=100.76s)]
*  the hot seat. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  And surprise, surprise, he doesn't know anything about Trump's plans either. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  Is it illegal for the President to instruct the IRS to remove nonprofit status from a taxpayer? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=113.0s)]
*  I'm not going to have the answer that you need. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=123.0s)]
*  I apologize, but like I said... [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=125.0s)]
*  Why are you not having the answer? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=127.0s)]
*  You've had three weeks to consult with lawyers. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=129.0s)]
*  I'm asking what I think is a pretty simple question. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=131.4s)]
*  Can the President of the United States legally tell the IRS to change someone's nonprofit status? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=135.0s)]
*  I'm not able to answer. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=143.0s)]
*  You can't read these words and tell what those words say. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=145.0s)]
*  I mean, leave it to a former professor to really make him seem as unprepared for class [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=151.0s)]
*  as humanly possible. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=155.0s)]
*  I felt like maybe I had failed the class there watching that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=156.0s)]
*  But Senator Warren Royce is also going to join me tonight to discuss that hearing a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=159.0s)]
*  whole lot more, including the middle of the night vote that is apparently happening on [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=163.0s)]
*  the big, beautiful bill. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=167.0s)]
*  But out of all Trump's cabinet members who displayed either willful or genuine ignorance, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=169.0s)]
*  hard to know the difference today, and there was a lot of competition, the most galling [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=174.0s)]
*  had to be Trump's Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=178.0s)]
*  Secretary Noem, what is habeas corpus? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=183.0s)]
*  Well, habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the President has to be able to remove [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=186.0s)]
*  people from this country and suspend their right to... [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=192.0s)]
*  Let me stop you, ma'am. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=195.0s)]
*  ...suspend their right to... [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=196.0s)]
*  habeas corpus, excuse me, that's incorrect. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=197.0s)]
*  I mean, given Noem's answer there, she's in the cabinet, everyone. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=200.0s)]
*  That response from Secretary Hassan was pretty polite, I would say. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=205.0s)]
*  I mean, habeas corpus is definitely not the right that the President has to be able to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=208.0s)]
*  remove people from this country. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=211.0s)]
*  In fact, it is actually kind of the opposite. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=213.0s)]
*  It is the opposite, which Senator Hassan was quick to point out to her in the hearing. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=215.0s)]
*  Habeas corpus is the legal principle that requires that the government provide a public [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=220.0s)]
*  reason for detaining and imprisoning people. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=227.0s)]
*  If not for that protection, the government could simply arrest people, including American [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=230.0s)]
*  citizens, and hold them indefinitely for no reason. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=235.0s)]
*  Habeas corpus is the foundational right that separates free societies like America from [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=238.0s)]
*  police states like North Korea. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=244.0s)]
*  And if you thought that was the low point in Secretary Noem's hearing today, you would [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=247.0s)]
*  be incorrect, because things actually got worse for her after that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=253.0s)]
*  Do you know what section of the Constitution the suspension clause of habeas corpus is in? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=259.0s)]
*  I do not. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=264.0s)]
*  No. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=265.0s)]
*  Do you know which article it is in? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=266.0s)]
*  No, I do not, sir. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=267.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=269.0s)]
*  So it's pretty clear that Secretary Noem does not really know much at all about the fundamental [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=270.0s)]
*  right to due process in this country. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=275.0s)]
*  It's a pretty important right. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=277.0s)]
*  To be fair, she's been pretty busy dressing up as an ICE officer or dressing up as a border [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=279.0s)]
*  patrol agent or dressing up as a cowboy for some reason. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=285.0s)]
*  Not clear why that one. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=289.0s)]
*  Or dressing up as a SWAT team member with her gun pointed dangerously close to that man's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=291.0s)]
*  head, it appears. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=296.0s)]
*  And when she isn't busy playing dress up, Kristi Noem has also been busy with other [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=298.0s)]
*  ventures, apparently. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=302.0s)]
*  I mean, she's trying to launch her. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=303.0s)]
*  She's been in discussions about launching a Hunger Games style reality show, putting [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=304.0s)]
*  immigrants against each other. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=309.0s)]
*  That's a real thing that she has actually been discussing, as I'm sure you know. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=310.0s)]
*  But what that all tells us is that all of this dress up playing as various law enforcement [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=314.0s)]
*  officials and dreaming up cruel reality TV shows is maybe what Kristi Noem thinks her [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=320.0s)]
*  job is. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=326.0s)]
*  And what those answers in that hearing I played tell us is that she's obviously way out of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=327.0s)]
*  her depth on issues that the DHS secretary should have some understanding of, or a great [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=332.0s)]
*  deal of understanding of, to be honest. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c55QvfM7I&t=336.0s)]
