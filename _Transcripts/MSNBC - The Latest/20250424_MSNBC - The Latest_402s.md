# 'Secretary Chaos': Iraq veteran slams Hegseth amid yet another Signal app controversy
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY)
*  Joining us right now in the studio, we have host of the Independent Americans podcast [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=0.0s)]
*  and founder and CEO of Independent Veterans of America, Paul Rakoff. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=4.16s)]
*  Paul, good to have you here. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=7.88s)]
*  So, Hegseth and the White House, you heard them, the arguments, right? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=9.44s)]
*  They continue blaming the media, as the Secretary of Defense is the one who's actually doing [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=12.48s)]
*  things that bring into question his judgment and that which really arose in Signalgate. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=17.38s)]
*  But the fact that they're doing that and just blaming the media, is it likely to influence [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  folks inside the Pentagon? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=29.0s)]
*  Do they know what's going on? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=30.72s)]
*  How are they going to look at this malfeasance, if you want to call it that? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=32.32s)]
*  I think they know better than anybody, because they know there's a standard of effectiveness [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=36.84s)]
*  and professionalism that's almost always upheld by everyone and by the Secretary of Defense [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=41.2s)]
*  most of all. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=45.96s)]
*  He is Secretary Chaos right now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=46.96s)]
*  He is swarmed, he is engulfed, he is overwhelmed with controversy and chaos, and it's of his [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=48.379999999999995s)]
*  own making. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=53.24s)]
*  The Signalgate escapade continues to evolve. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=54.36s)]
*  Every six hours or so, we get a new element of how he's violated operational protocols [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  that could endanger the lives of Americans. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=61.64s)]
*  And that's ultimately what it's all about. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=63.84s)]
*  Everybody who works in the building knows that this is not allowed, it's not acceptable. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=65.48s)]
*  And when he tries to go around it, he jeopardizes lives. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=69.12s)]
*  And he can throw all the blame he wants on the media or the Democrats, but now he's being [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=71.8s)]
*  attacked by his own former advisors. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=75.06s)]
*  Three of them who've now posted an op-ed in Politico, they're talking to Tucker Carlson, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=77.16s)]
*  they're coming at him from within. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=81.32s)]
*  And they're exposing him and I think going to continue to leak stories of the next couple [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=83.11999999999999s)]
*  of days. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  And it's distracting us from what we need to be focused on. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  Ukraine, our national security, dealing with NATO. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  We need a quarterback running into this chaos who's stable. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=91.55999999999999s)]
*  Instead, we've got one that's rattled and shook and injured. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=94.24s)]
*  Which means what for the morale there and for the confidence in him? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is the guy who's going to send people into war, directly into harm's way, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=100.44s)]
*  if need be. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=105.83999999999999s)]
*  It's absolutely adversely impacting morale. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  It's also impacting recruiting, retention. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=109.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to be a part of this chaos where the Pentagon is supposed to be insulated from [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=111.16s)]
*  politics. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=115.52s)]
*  And instead, with Hegseth, you've got someone who is a political extremist, who's overtly [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=116.52s)]
*  political, who continues to dial up the political attacks and increase the pressure on himself [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  and everyone in the building almost every couple of hours. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=125.52s)]
*  He makes no attempt to bring the temperature down. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=128.76s)]
*  And I think that's what people in the building want to see. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=130.88s)]
*  Keep in mind, he fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=133.0s)]
*  He fired multiple senior generals. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=135.04s)]
*  He fired General Hogue. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=137.2s)]
*  So it's also bolstered by this lack of stability beneath him, not just at the political level, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=138.48s)]
*  but in the actual senior military officer ranks. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=144.16s)]
*  And that's where there's real concern. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=146.64s)]
*  Is there wisdom for someone who's leading the Pentagon, given the seriousness of what [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=147.92s)]
*  one has to do in that position, to not admit mistake, not admit frailty? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=153.16s)]
*  I mean, I'm just trying to throw a bone here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=158.6s)]
*  The opposite. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=161.48s)]
*  He should take it head on. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=162.48s)]
*  He should take responsibility. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=163.64s)]
*  He should meet the moment. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=164.64s)]
*  He should show that he has character and integrity and that he will set the standard for our [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=166.08s)]
*  over a million people who are in the Department of Defense. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  He has to be the best example. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=173.08s)]
*  And right now, he is the worst example. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=175.16000000000003s)]
*  If he was a private in the 82nd Airborne, he'd probably be in handcuffs and standing [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  before a UCMJ group. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=180.96s)]
*  But instead, he continues to fight in a way that I think is really shameful. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=182.5s)]
*  I mean, everybody can see the truth here, and he keeps digging in deeper and he's sinking [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  our Pentagon deeper as a result. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  Which begs the question, how long can this continue? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  How long can it continue not only from action and activity inside the Pentagon, but from [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=195.32s)]
*  the Trump administration to say, we stand by him? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=200.64s)]
*  I mean, be real. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=203.28s)]
*  It will continue until Trump decides otherwise. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=204.28s)]
*  There's only one Republican, I believe, Don Bacon, who I think has been outspoken and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  brave and courageous in saying that Hegsatz should step down, but he's in isolation right [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=210.72s)]
*  now. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  So ultimately, it comes down to Trump. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  And I do think Trump is holding him on thin ice right now because he's slowing down the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=216.67999999999998s)]
*  Trump agenda. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=220.32s)]
*  Prior to this, he was making tremendous progress as far as Trump is concerned in moving through [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=221.32s)]
*  his extreme agenda at the Pentagon, purging people, driving this all forward. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=225.24s)]
*  Hegsatz is screwing that all up right now. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=229.28s)]
*  And if you replace Hegsatz with someone like Tom Cotton or Joni Ernst or someone else that's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=231.12s)]
*  viewed as more stable and understands the institution, it would put it at least on a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  pause and allow him to focus on other things. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=239.16s)]
*  So I think Trump's attention is short, and the leash he's got him on is short, too. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=241.28s)]
*  Among in terms of focus on other things, let's talk about a priority for Secretary Hegsatz [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=245.24s)]
*  that did see a bit of movement today, and that's on the DOJ, which asked the Supreme [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=249.8s)]
*  Court, allow President Trump to enforce his ban on transgender troops serving openly [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=253.96s)]
*  in the military. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=259.68s)]
*  What kind of message does it send to have the Secretary of Defense so focused on things [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=261.92s)]
*  like a transgender ban in the military, which, if I remember correctly, affects 0.4 percent [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=267.04s)]
*  of people who identify as trans or having some issues with their sexuality, 0.4 percent [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=274.52s)]
*  in the military? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=282.32s)]
*  This is what happens when you have an overtly extreme political culture warrior as your [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=283.68s)]
*  secretary of defense. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=287.88s)]
*  This is what so many of us warn people about with regard to Pete Hegsatz. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=288.88s)]
*  He's focused on these things instead of Ukraine, instead of increasing recruiting, instead [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=292.36s)]
*  of reforming our military in ways that are positive. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  He says that DEI is the enemy instead of Russia. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=298.92s)]
*  That's the problem here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=302.24s)]
*  And the reality is, transgender people should be able to openly serve just like everyone [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=303.24s)]
*  else. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=306.96s)]
*  And not only is it disruptive to the overall environment, you have to actually rip transgendered [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=307.96s)]
*  service members out of their unit and impact the people around them. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=311.72s)]
*  So it's bad politics. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=314.8s)]
*  It's bad morality, in my view, but it's also very bad for our national defense. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's another distraction from bigger issues. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=319.76000000000005s)]
*  But it's where Hegsatz made his money coming up for the last two decades. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  And it looks like he's only going to double down. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  Last question on former NATO Secretary General who's in town today. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  We have Jen Stoltenberger, was once referred to as the Trump whisperer. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm sure you recall that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=334.20000000000005s)]
*  Is it possible to modify relative Ukraine, this American plan? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  How do you see that happening? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=340.8s)]
*  Because the big issue is the seeding of land, which President Zelensky says that's unconstitutional [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=342.92s)]
*  against the Ukraine constitution. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=349.12s)]
*  The big issue is Trump. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=350.52s)]
*  And he's changed his tune a little bit in the last 24 hours, which is significant for [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=351.52s)]
*  him. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  He's still victim shaming Zelensky. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  He's still putting pressure on Ukraine instead of on Putin. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  He's still asking for what I think are ridiculous concessions like giving up Crimea. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=361.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  Ukraine was long gone. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM40A1NXMcY&t=366.03999999999996s)]
