# Are a Qatari jet and the Statue of Liberty comparable gifts? Democratic Rep. weighs in
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY)
*  It's a perfectly legal transaction. It's been vetted by White House counsel, by the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=0.0s)]
*  Justice Department. There are outside law firms involved. So it's a perfectly legal [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=8.24s)]
*  government-to-government, department-of-defense-to-department-of-defense transaction. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=13.92s)]
*  Could it color the perception of the administration, if they have a $400 million plane, to be more [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=20.68s)]
*  in favor of these things? Perhaps. It at least gives the appearance of a conflict of interest. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=25.36s)]
*  I don't think it's worth the headache. And I think it's detracting from a largely successful [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=30.0s)]
*  trip to the Middle East. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=35.0s)]
*  There you have the Trump administration, as well as members of Congress, weighing in today on that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=37.6s)]
*  $400 million plane Qatar plans to give President Trump, intended to serve as Air Force One [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=41.6s)]
*  temporarily. Joining me now is Democratic Representative Deborah Ross of North Carolina. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=48.36s)]
*  She sits on the Ethics and Judiciary Committees and is the vice chair of the subcommittee on [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=57.64s)]
*  We're awfully glad you're here, ma'am. Thank you for joining us. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=60.44s)]
*  So from an ethics standpoint, is this as legal and proper as Mr. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=62.44s)]
*  Woodcock is arguing? And how can it be a gift to the Department of Defense and not to the president [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=67.76s)]
*  himself if Donald Trump, after office, plans to take ownership of it after he leaves? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=73.76s)]
*  Well, good to be with you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=80.6s)]
*  No, it is not legal and the human's clause of the Constitution. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=82.72s)]
*  And we have a long history of presidents who have been offered gifts from foreign countries. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=91.96s)]
*  Many of those presidents have simply turned them down. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  But the alternative that Donald Trump has is to come to Congress and ask for our approval of this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=102.64s)]
*  gift. And that has happened in the past. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=109.12s)]
*  Sometimes Congress has said yes, and sometimes it has said no. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=111.4s)]
*  The Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have issued a resolution asking the Trump administration [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=114.92s)]
*  to bring this before Congress, because that is what the Constitution requires. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=121.92s)]
*  But he just wants to accept the gift, create a constitutional conflict and create this real [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  taint, not just on that trip, but on our relationships in the Middle East. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=135.88s)]
*  It's just wrong. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=140.44s)]
*  Let me ask you, I believe it was Senator Kennedy who made the comparison, or at least asked the question [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=142.76s)]
*  of what France gave to the United States, the Statue of Liberty, and said, was that legal? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't feel like a fair one-on-one comparison. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=155.6s)]
*  Give me your thoughts on that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=158.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know all the history about the Statue of Liberty, but that wasn't given to the president. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=159.4s)]
*  And if Congress thought it was great to have the Statue of Liberty, which I assume Congress would think [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=167.08s)]
*  is a good idea, then that's the process. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=173.8s)]
*  The key is that there is a process. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=177.0s)]
*  Our founders set up this process, and President Trump is not beyond the law or the Constitution. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  He needs to follow the process. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=187.72s)]
*  If he wants the plane, he has to ask for Congress to agree to accept it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  OK, let's turn now together to the GOP mega bill, because the House Budget Committee, as you know, is going to try [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=195.16s)]
*  for a second time to advance that bill. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=200.76s)]
*  That happens less than eight hours from now, 10 p.m. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=202.48s)]
*  tonight. Do you think it will pass this time? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  And how could it change to get those hardline Republicans on board? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=208.44s)]
*  Well, I cannot read the tea leaves on this one because the Republican conference is divided, and different [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=212.44s)]
*  parts of the Republican conference want different things that are completely in conflict with each other. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=220.56s)]
*  So the more moderates want more good, more services for their people. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=225.72s)]
*  They also want greater tax relief under SALT. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  The more really the ultra-maga wing, the Freedom Caucus, doesn't like the deficit that this creates. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=236.96s)]
*  And they have a point there. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=244.56s)]
*  But what they want to do is have more tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country and take away food [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=246.04s)]
*  assistance, take away health care through Medicaid, take away a lot of things that our families rely on. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=255.6s)]
*  That's a conflict they're going to have to work out. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=263.6s)]
*  But the bottom line is this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=265.96s)]
*  Both of their solutions increase the deficit and hurt the American people. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=268.16s)]
*  And to your point about Medicaid, the CBO says that Medicaid cuts would result in 10 million people losing coverage. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=274.16s)]
*  And it's stumbling still because some Republicans argue, hey, that's not enough. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  Cut Medicaid more. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=287.88s)]
*  It's also a problem. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=289.88s)]
*  It's also going to raise the deficit, though, this bill. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=292.68s)]
*  What would the consequences, big picture, be of this bill? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=296.08s)]
*  And is there a level of work requirements that Democrats would support in order to obtain Medicaid? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=299.68s)]
*  What people do not realize, and I think the Republicans are denying, is that there are three groups of people who get [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=307.44s)]
*  Medicaid, predominantly get the Medicaid. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=316.44s)]
*  Children, people with disabilities, and people in nursing homes. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=320.48s)]
*  More than half of the people in nursing homes receive Medicaid. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=325.48s)]
*  So the work requirements that the Republicans are putting in are trying to get the parents of those children and other [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=329.96s)]
*  people to not accept Medicaid. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=338.2s)]
*  They also want to kick those same people off of the Affordable Care Act. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=340.88s)]
*  But Medicaid, by and large, is helping children, pregnant women or women who just had children, people with disabilities, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=344.76000000000005s)]
*  and people in nursing homes. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=355.56s)]
*  And the Republicans want to frame Medicaid as something that is not for everyday Americans. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=357.56s)]
*  But everyday Americans rely on Medicaid. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  And scaring people off of Medicaid will only make people sicker. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  Then they won't have insurance and they won't be able to pay their medical bills. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=371.8s)]
*  There's something very, very wrong and very, very cruel with their assessment of Medicaid. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=375.92s)]
*  And especially when you're going to ask those three groups you were naming in particular about work requirements. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=381.88s)]
*  But let me get to the hearing on the Trump administration's effort to curb birthright citizenship, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  because the Solicitor General was asked about how enforcement would actually work. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=391.2s)]
*  And here's what he said. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  The quote is, we don't know. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=396.28000000000003s)]
*  Adding federal officials will have to figure that out. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=398.36s)]
*  Is this administration moving forward with their agenda with no real plan for the follow through? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=401.48s)]
*  This administration isn't planning on any kinds of follow through. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=408.16s)]
*  I mean, I represent North Carolina, where they're not even getting the money out the door that we appropriated for Hurricane Helene. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  But what is the worst thing about this administration is that they have done unconstitutional things like birthright citizenship. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  They have no idea how they would even implement it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=430.12s)]
*  And then when they are told by the courts that this is unconstitutional and every court that has heard the birthright citizenship issue, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=433.91999999999996s)]
*  no matter who appointed that judge, has said that it's flatly unconstitutional, they still keep pressing it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=442.88s)]
*  They have to understand the people of this country have economic concerns. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=450.68s)]
*  They have health care concerns. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=456.28s)]
*  They're worried about their kids education. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=458.0s)]
*  This administration should stop violating the Constitution and start taking care of people. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=460.76s)]
*  Representative Deborah Ross, thank you so much for your time with us on this Sunday. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=467.28s)]
*  Appreciate that. Next. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAh9Ijb30OY&t=470.68s)]
