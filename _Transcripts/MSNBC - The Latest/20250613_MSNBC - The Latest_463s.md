# ‘Makes Washington look feckless’: Experts slam U.S. response to Israel-Iran attacks
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY)
*  This makes Washington look pretty feckless, right? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=0.0s)]
*  Because one of two things is true. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Either Donald Trump did not want this to happen, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=5.2s)]
*  wanted Steve Wittgoff to go there this weekend, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=8.94s)]
*  and Israel bombed Iran and killed the person [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=11.58s)]
*  that was overseeing those negotiations with Steve Wittgoff, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=14.44s)]
*  or Donald Trump, when he went to the Gulf Arabs [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=17.28s)]
*  a few weeks ago, lied to them [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=21.48s)]
*  in saying that he wanted an Iran deal. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=23.32s)]
*  Neither of those is particularly a good look [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=25.16s)]
*  for the United States. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=27.86s)]
*  Either we're being duplicitous about matters [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=29.42s)]
*  as important as whether or not [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=32.5s)]
*  we're seriously pursuing a diplomatic deal, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=34.06s)]
*  or we're just being ignored by Bibi Netanyahu [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=36.7s)]
*  who went ahead with a military strike [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=40.54s)]
*  over the objections of Donald Trump [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=42.74s)]
*  on the eve of really important nuclear talks. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=44.44s)]
*  Either way, I don't think we're a trustworthy partner [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=48.0s)]
*  for people in this region around the world, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=50.78s)]
*  and that's my concern for U.S. interests. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=52.94s)]
*  Beyond what could happen in the Middle East, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=55.78s)]
*  this could go right or it could go wrong. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=57.540000000000006s)]
*  We don't know, we'll have to see. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  But for the U.S., it just kind of feeds into this notion [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  that the chaos and the violence around the world [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=64.48s)]
*  that Donald Trump said he was gonna end, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  whether it's in Gaza or Iran or Ukraine, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=69.66s)]
*  has just gotten worse since Donald Trump has taken office. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=72.66s)]
*  You know, this is such an important point [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=75.86s)]
*  because the reality of the situation is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=78.16s)]
*  the negotiations, they needed to take place [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=82.10000000000001s)]
*  in order to get some kind of deal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=85.2s)]
*  And I think it's important for people to understand [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=86.16s)]
*  that the last time the United States was able [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=87.6s)]
*  to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=90.14s)]
*  it took not just months, it took years. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=92.1s)]
*  And we're supposed to believe that Steve Wittkopf, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=95.1s)]
*  the mogul, the business mogul, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=97.98s)]
*  can come in in less than six months [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=101.54s)]
*  and negotiate another nuclear deal. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=103.78s)]
*  I just, I am kind of blown by that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=105.92s)]
*  But as we stated, I know, as Andrea brought up, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=109.22s)]
*  the president has said, he thinks the talks should continue, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=112.08s)]
*  but you know, Iranian state media and the Oman News Agency [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=114.72s)]
*  are reporting that officials from Iran say [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=119.06s)]
*  that the talks are now suspended, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=121.8s)]
*  that they are not happening. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=123.16s)]
*  So now there's no conversation, no deal, and chaos. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, what is, we'll- [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=129.1s)]
*  You couldn't have said it any better, Simone. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=130.9s)]
*  The fact remains is that Wittkopf, to his credit [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=133.74s)]
*  and to the credit of those in the administration, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=137.84s)]
*  came up with an ingenious idea. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  They were going to try to convince the Iranians [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=142.46s)]
*  that they could continue to enrich uranium outside of Iran [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=145.82s)]
*  in what was going to be some sort of consortium arrangement [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=150.7s)]
*  that the administration was trying to sell [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=154.16s)]
*  with the Gulf states, okay? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  The Supreme Leader said at the beginning of these talks, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=158.68s)]
*  no way, Jose, we are never going to export [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=161.44s)]
*  our Iranian enrichment program to another territory [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=164.94s)]
*  under the supervision of other countries. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=169.78s)]
*  The administration came back and said, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=172.8s)]
*  we need you to agree to this, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  and the Supreme Leader said no. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=175.96s)]
*  Two times he said no, three times he's out, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=179.08s)]
*  and in the meantime, while these negotiations were going on, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=181.36s)]
*  the intelligence information that I have [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=185.84s)]
*  from Israeli sources is that the Iranians [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=187.8s)]
*  had continued to really rush to try to get to a point [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=191.66s)]
*  where their enrichment was now able to become [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=195.96s)]
*  an ignition, a system that could be ignited onto a bomb, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=198.92s)]
*  and the Israeli intelligence, which had been operating [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=203.04s)]
*  through the Mossad in Iran for some time, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=205.82s)]
*  came to Netanyahu and to the American government and said, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=208.76s)]
*  we have run out of time, and it's just also convenient [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=211.92s)]
*  that Benjamin Netanyahu survived the no confidence motion [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  and can therefore not be blamed, so to speak, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  by his own people for going to war with Iran [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=222.72s)]
*  in order to preserve his coalition. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  Let me just pick up a thread here, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=227.68s)]
*  because I think Ben is absolutely right. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=230.36s)]
*  My information has been that on his last visit, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=233.16s)]
*  Netanyahu came to Washington to get the go ahead [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  for US air cover for Israeli special forces operations [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=239.96s)]
*  to go after the nuclear facilities in Iran, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  including Fordow, the underground operation. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=249.84s)]
*  That's proactively or if Iran retaliates? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=252.84s)]
*  No, proactively, for a strike, and that to his dismay, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=256.4s)]
*  in the very trip where he came here seeking the green light [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=262.67999999999995s)]
*  for a very different operation than the one that took place, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=266.91999999999996s)]
*  the president in his presence in front of the cameras [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=270.5s)]
*  in the Oval Office, as he has wanted to do, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  announced wouldn't it be a good idea [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=276.44s)]
*  to have direct talks with Iran? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=277.88s)]
*  Direct talks, not the indirect talks, direct talks. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=279.79999999999995s)]
*  And Netanyahu was completely angry, dismayed, rejected. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=283.02000000000004s)]
*  He came here under the cover of talking about tariffs, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=288.94s)]
*  but it was really to get approval [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=291.18s)]
*  for a major joint operation. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=292.5s)]
*  And in the interim, of course, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=296.5s)]
*  the president did his Gulf trip, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=298.18s)]
*  bypassing Israel significantly, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=300.26s)]
*  and getting sign on for the continued negotiations [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=303.88s)]
*  to try to come up with a deal with Iran on the nuclear piece. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=309.36s)]
*  What Netanyahu has never wanted [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=314.36s)]
*  is negotiations on a nuclear deal. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=316.96s)]
*  Not when Obama tried it, he went to Congress. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=319.5s)]
*  He got the Republican speaker, remember, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=321.92s)]
*  to insulting the White House by, well, you were there. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=324.84s)]
*  You know all about that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=329.64s)]
*  I mean, that was just a mess. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=331.32s)]
*  So Netanyahu came here and campaigned [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=334.22s)]
*  against the nuclear deal. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=338.66s)]
*  I covered all of that, and we were, as you point out, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=339.82000000000005s)]
*  it took years. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  We were in all over Switzerland. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=343.8s)]
*  I mean, Ben was in it, Michael, he was in it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=345.94000000000005s)]
*  So I was gonna dovetail on that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  We got less than a minute left on this, Ben, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=350.42s)]
*  but to the points that Andrea was making, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=352.3s)]
*  so do you think in light of that visit by Netanyahu [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=355.26000000000005s)]
*  with Trump and how that unfolded, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=359.26000000000005s)]
*  Netanyahu went, you know what, I got this. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=361.1s)]
*  We're just gonna take it, and we're gonna do it our way. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=364.5s)]
*  And now there's a little bit of cleanup on aisle nine [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=366.58000000000004s)]
*  on the back end and sort of say who was in [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=368.90000000000003s)]
*  or not in the conversation. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=371.46000000000004s)]
*  What's your take about that reporting? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=372.86s)]
*  100% it's cleanup on aisle nine. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=376.22s)]
*  And look, with all the respect, Mark, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=378.06s)]
*  the Iranians have a long way to go to weaponization. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=380.26s)]
*  They have to get enough fuel, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  then they have to weaponize it, they have to miniaturize it, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=385.94s)]
*  they have to put in a warhead. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=388.24s)]
*  That was not gonna happen in a few weeks. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=389.42s)]
*  They did not have to do this before Steve Wyckoff [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=391.62s)]
*  went there in two days because of any intelligence. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=393.86s)]
*  And so what I think happened is Netanyahu wanted to do this. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=396.7s)]
*  He did not want there to be a deal [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=399.42s)]
*  between the United States and Iran negotiated by Donald Trump. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=400.78000000000003s)]
*  He did not wanna take the risk that that would happen. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=403.58s)]
*  He wanted to take the shot. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=405.74s)]
*  He's wanted to take this shot for years. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=407.02s)]
*  And he did this over the objections [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=409.3s)]
*  of the American administration. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=411.46s)]
*  And Donald Trump took a look at that and was like, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=412.82s)]
*  well, I can do two things. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=414.74s)]
*  I can either get on board with this [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=416.18s)]
*  or I can say that I was against this. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=418.46s)]
*  And now he's trying to pretend [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=420.56s)]
*  like this is something that he wanted to do [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=421.84s)]
*  when he didn't wanna do it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  And he's not up to these challenges. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=425.2s)]
*  He said he would end the war in Ukraine on day one, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=427.35999999999996s)]
*  that war escalated. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=429.58s)]
*  He said he would end the war in Gaza, that war has escalated. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  He said he would prevent this war in Iran, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=433.32s)]
*  now we're in a war between Israel and Iran. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=435.24s)]
*  That's what's happening. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=437.5s)]
*  And he's just not up to dealing with the complexities [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=438.91999999999996s)]
*  of these challenges. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=441.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqZ-iBeFGY&t=450.52s)]
