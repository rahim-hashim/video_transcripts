# Will there be ‘more sizzle than steak’ in tomorrow’s U.S.-China trade announcement?
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI)
*  I say to those American workers, Scott Besant is in Geneva right now talking to his counterparties [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=0.0s)]
*  in China, right? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Remember, this is just a China problem right now, right? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  We have 145 percent tariff, they have 125 percent tariff. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=11.16s)]
*  Those tariffs are too high to do business. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=15.44s)]
*  But that's why they're talking right now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Joining us now is former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Biden administration, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=20.96s)]
*  Jared Bernstein and Politico White House reporter Megan Messerly. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=25.12s)]
*  Welcome to you both. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=28.6s)]
*  Jared, what is your reaction to Commerce Secretary Lutnick there? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=29.6s)]
*  I mean, it is valid for dock workers and truckers who are losing jobs right now to ask why these [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  tariffs were so high to begin with, right? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=38.64s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  What I was struck by and what we just heard was Secretary Lutnick sounding like this problem [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  that we have came from outer space. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=49.56s)]
*  It wasn't, in fact, his administration and his boss, President Trump, who set these tariffs [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=52.96s)]
*  at a completely impossible level, 145 percent. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=60.16s)]
*  Alex, you and I have talked about this for a long time, and especially in the Biden administration. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=63.36s)]
*  I was always straightforward about accusing China of unfair trading practices. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=69.16s)]
*  But you don't get to where you need to be by stopping, which is essentially what we've [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=76.08s)]
*  done, cargo ships from moving between here and there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=81.48s)]
*  And so we are almost certainly looking at empty shelves a few weeks hence. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=84.4s)]
*  This administration never thinks of measuring once, twice, thrice, and then cutting. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=90.48s)]
*  They just cut and then let the chips fall where they may. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=95.68s)]
*  And that's just a terrible way to run a global economy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  And look, Lutnick, if you agree, sounded completely obtuse to concerns by dock workers, by truckers, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=102.56s)]
*  who are saying, hey, we're seeing our hourly work diminish. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  We're worried about less income and being able to pay for what we need to for our families. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  There was no sense of that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  So Alex, your problem with your analysis is you just have too much common sense that you're [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=122.16s)]
*  bringing to this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=126.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=129.12s)]
*  It's anyone who knows anything about this, and even people who don't know much about it, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=129.76s)]
*  will tell you that if you set prohibitive tariffs, dock workers are shortly going to be in trouble. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=136.0s)]
*  Now, if you want to explain to those dock workers why this is worth their while, why on the other [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=142.88s)]
*  side of this great things will happen, go ahead and try. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  Pay now, gain later. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=151.6s)]
*  But in fact, there's no, no zero empirical evidence that these kinds of initiatives will [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  yield anything that's going to help those workers or for that matter, the rest of us. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=160.0s)]
*  On the other side of this, which is, by the way, why you see the administration working [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=165.12s)]
*  pretty hard to find off ramps to the president's just terrible trade policies. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=169.84s)]
*  And they all kind of run around trying to explain how they're doing great negotiations. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=175.04s)]
*  They're just covering up the damage that he's done. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=179.2s)]
*  So Megan, this meeting, it was just to get the ball rolling. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=183.28s)]
*  So expectations from the Trump administration weren't high going in. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=186.0s)]
*  And yet Trump is touting a quote, total reset of trade relations. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=189.76s)]
*  And now we have confirmation of quote, substantial progress. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=194.48s)]
*  Was this second day of negotiations and unexpected development? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=198.48s)]
*  Is it hinting things are going better than expected? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=202.56s)]
*  I mean, that is certainly what the administration is telegraphing out of these talks in Geneva. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  I think the one thing that we've heard is substantial progress. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=211.84s)]
*  U.S. Trade Representative Jameson Greer in the statement he put out even referred to the words, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=215.83999999999997s)]
*  you know, a deal of some sort. Of course, we don't know exactly what that means. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=220.64s)]
*  It's unlikely to be sort of a full-fledged trade deal or even the kind of frameworks that we've seen [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=225.44s)]
*  be in talks in other countries like the one we just saw come out of the United Kingdom last week. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=231.92s)]
*  So I think there's still a lot of questions about what exactly the details of this are. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=236.16s)]
*  Now we've heard that there will be a briefing tomorrow, so we will get more of these details. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  And of course, some of the details may start to trickle out ahead of that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=245.44s)]
*  I think the big question is going to be, you know, was this just a reestablishing of relationships, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=248.72s)]
*  which was sort of the baseline goal going into the meeting, you know, just an easing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=254.0s)]
*  of tensions and opening the door for future negotiations? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=258.08s)]
*  Or did we actually see some real movement here? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=261.92s)]
*  The president posted on True Social before this Geneva meeting said, you know, 80 percent [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  tariff sounds good to me, but I'll leave it up to Secretary Besant. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=271.2s)]
*  But I think to the point that you all have been discussing, 80 percent is still prohibitively high. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  So that would honestly be more of sort of a cosmetic change, sort of signaling and easing [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=280.32s)]
*  of tensions more than anything with any practical effect. So lots of details to be figured out. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And in terms of, I mean, I'm going to pick up on that with you, Jared, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=291.44s)]
*  and you said off-ramp, this 80 percent that Donald Trump threw out there. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  Experts are saying it's not going to make very much of a difference. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=299.52s)]
*  So where is the Goldilocks zone, if you will? What rate could be enough to create the effect [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  that Trump wants but not leave store shelves empty? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  There's no sweeping tariff that answers that question. That is, there's no tariff [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=313.35999999999996s)]
*  on the north of 400 billion dollars of imports from China that is appropriate for every one of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=318.0s)]
*  those imports. The problem that the administration faces is that they never did what you have to do [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=324.8s)]
*  in this space. Roll up your sleeves, go product by product, figure out where unfair trade is [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  taking place, and tariff that product. That's what tariffs have historically been used for, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  and when you do it that way, it can work. But when you're talking about, Megan is 100 percent right. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=341.12s)]
*  When you're talking about 145 or 80 or 70 or 60, none of those are off-ramps. 34 percent is [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=346.56s)]
*  probably not an off-ramp. So look, if you want to have a baseline tariff of something in the 10 [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=355.04s)]
*  percent neighborhood for some of the goods that are identified as being unfairly traded or higher [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=360.64s)]
*  than that, we went a lot higher than that on things like electric vehicles and critical minerals [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=367.04s)]
*  because those were areas where China was flooding our market unjustly. So if you want to roll up [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=371.84s)]
*  your sleeves and do the work, be my guest, case by case, product by product, the approach that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=377.11999999999995s)]
*  they're taking won't work. Okay, you're suggesting a surgical approach is what's needed. So Megan, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=382.56s)]
*  how much has President Trump been in touch with Treasury Secretary Scott Besson this weekend? Do [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=388.0s)]
*  we know if Trump gave input on negotiations? Or is he more hands-off, and does he trust Besson's [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=392.96s)]
*  judgment on this? I think it's really been a combination of the two. I mean, we know that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=398.88s)]
*  going into this meeting, the president essentially gave Secretary Besson his proxy here. Again, in [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=404.48s)]
*  that true social post, saying it's up to Scott B is how he referred to it in the post, that gives [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=410.4s)]
*  him a lot of leeway, Secretary Besson a lot of leeway to actually be able to negotiate something. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=416.32s)]
*  On the other hand, we know that they have been in close communication. We know they talked last [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=420.88s)]
*  night. So this is not happening without the president's involvement or input. This was [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=426.0s)]
*  something that was really important to China. In fact, they had been asking for a point person [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=431.44s)]
*  from the administration to be able to have these kinds of conversations with. And they wanted to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=435.84s)]
*  know that this is someone who had the president's support and the president's ear. So it's important [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=440.32s)]
*  to China also that the president is looped in on this, because of course, if Secretary Besson goes [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=445.04s)]
*  in and makes a deal that the president is not okay with, he's not going to adhere to it. And so it's [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=449.68s)]
*  been important that they stay in communication. So I think what we've really seen here is sort of [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=454.96s)]
*  the influence of Secretary Besson on shaping the president's tariff agenda, on one hand, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=459.35999999999996s)]
*  really embracing tariffs and the role of tariffs, but like we've seen in some of these broader [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  conversations and what's going on in India and Japan, trying to figure out a way to walk back [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=471.28s)]
*  some of those tariffs and actually come to some sort of agreements with some of these countries. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=477.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Give me a sense, Jared, of where you think this goes next based on what we heard today. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=481.12s)]
*  You know, that's really a challenging question because we've had so much back and forth and so [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=487.76s)]
*  much uncertainty. I think one of the things we should watch for tomorrow is how much information [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  we get in this presser that we're expecting to hear about the deal. If it stays up at vagaries, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=498.47999999999996s)]
*  30, 40,000 feet, I think we'll see markets and investors get a bit nervous that maybe there's [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=504.8s)]
*  a lot more sizzle than stake in what they just delivered. So the first thing we should do is look [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=511.12s)]
*  at market reactions tomorrow. And then we have to just look at really, you know, hard, raw numbers. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=516.48s)]
*  If they're coming in at a comprehensive sledgehammer versus surgical, to use your [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=522.08s)]
*  apt analogy, number that's, you know, anywhere between 50 and 100 percent, we're still looking [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=528.4s)]
*  at empty shelves and a lot of American workers and small businesses having real problems. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=534.24s)]
*  So those are a couple of areas I want to keep a close watch on. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=539.44s)]
*  Okay. Jared, Megan, thank you both for the conversation. Appreciate that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUPkfXh9YI&t=542.4000000000001s)]
