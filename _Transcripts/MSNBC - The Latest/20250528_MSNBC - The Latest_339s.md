# 'The circle is tightening': DA on manhunt for two New Orleans inmates still on the run
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k)
*  And then there were two this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=0.0s)]
*  A manhunt continues for the remaining [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=2.72s)]
*  inmates still on the run after escaping [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=4.72s)]
*  in New Orleans jail nearly two weeks ago. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=7.0s)]
*  Now new body camera footage shows the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=9.36s)]
*  moments two other escapees were recaptured [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=11.56s)]
*  after a high speed chase with police in Texas. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=13.72s)]
*  Again of the original 10 who made that [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=17.16s)]
*  daring escape eight are now back in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=19.78s)]
*  custody and two remain on the lam. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=22.16s)]
*  Joining us now is Jason Williams, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=24.32s)]
*  District Attorney of Orleans Parish, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=26.2s)]
*  and Jason I know you are incredibly [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=28.04s)]
*  busy, especially with this case ongoing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=30.0s)]
*  Antoine Massey, one of the inmates still [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=31.96s)]
*  at large for learning and associate, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  has now been taken into custody [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=35.24s)]
*  by Louisiana State Police. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=36.8s)]
*  They've asked the media not to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=38.32s)]
*  disclose the person's identity, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=39.8s)]
*  but that's some of the latest [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=41.04s)]
*  information coming in on our end. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=42.64s)]
*  What's the latest you can share on the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=44.16s)]
*  investigation and just how sprawling it's become? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=46.32s)]
*  It has become sprawling. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=49.16s)]
*  We've got very credible information [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  about the the areas that these [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=52.4s)]
*  individuals are now these last few weeks. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=54.4s)]
*  Now these last two, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=56.56s)]
*  I believe by all accounts are [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=58.04s)]
*  considered to be the most dangerous [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  of the 10 Mr Groves as you're aware, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  was convicted of a double murder. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=65.4s)]
*  We had to try the case twice. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  I prosecuted myself. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=70.2s)]
*  Mr Massey has escaped from multiple [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=71.4s)]
*  facilities and they're they're both [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=73.48s)]
*  considered armed and dangerous, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=75.64s)]
*  but we're very close and that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=77.4s)]
*  circle is tightening very very quickly. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=79.72s)]
*  And I believe they're going to be [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=82.12s)]
*  captured soon, so the circle is tightening, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=85.2s)]
*  but it also sounds like the scope or [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=87.96s)]
*  the location could be broadening in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=90.72s)]
*  terms of crossing state lines. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=92.96s)]
*  The local sheriff in Natchez, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=94.96s)]
*  Mississippi says he doesn't [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=96.8s)]
*  believe that Antoine Massey is there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=98.32s)]
*  There were unconfirmed reports [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=100.56s)]
*  of sightings of him there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  Do you believe that these last two [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  inmates are somewhere outside Louisiana? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=106.08s)]
*  It has been well over a week [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=108.12s)]
*  since they broke out. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=110.36s)]
*  I think there's a good chance that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=111.92s)]
*  there's still inside in in Louisiana. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  It is. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  It is difficult to navigate spaces [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=118.92s)]
*  without being documented either by [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=121.84s)]
*  crime camera, social media footage. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=124.48s)]
*  AG spread the word and photographs [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=126.84s)]
*  to the surrounding states. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=129.6s)]
*  Individuals, family members of these [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=131.88s)]
*  individuals who have helped are [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=134.32s)]
*  realizing there is a dear cost to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=136.72s)]
*  aiding and abetting that is changing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=140.12s)]
*  the narrative very much and I believe [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=142.92s)]
*  that there's still in Louisiana and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=145.84s)]
*  I believe that we're going to catch [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=148.28s)]
*  him. How many alleged accomplices [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=150.76s)]
*  are you guys now looking to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=152.72s)]
*  bring charges against? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=154.96s)]
*  Well, that number is growing every [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=156.12s)]
*  single day and it appears to grow [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=158.32s)]
*  every night. My OSINT team, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  open source intelligence team, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=162.96s)]
*  basically digital forensics has [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=164.64s)]
*  been scouring through hours of jail calls. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=166.56s)]
*  Listening to who they were talking [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=169.52s)]
*  to in the days and weeks leading [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  up to the escape, it's led to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=173.84s)]
*  arrest of fugitives. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=176.24s)]
*  It's led to the arrest of people [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=177.12s)]
*  who are assisting and I think it's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=179.4s)]
*  going to help us track down these [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  last two. The US Marshals office [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  also said tips from the public have [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=185.44s)]
*  been helping police to recapture at [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  least three of the inmates this week. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=189.36s)]
*  How are authorities managing all [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=191.44s)]
*  the information that's coming in? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=192.96s)]
*  And what kinds of tips are you getting? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=194.56s)]
*  So the public is absolutely the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=196.8s)]
*  biggest man on this entire endeavor, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=198.56s)]
*  which is why it's so problematic [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=200.68s)]
*  that the sheriff didn't ring the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=202.72s)]
*  alarm at 1 AM when this occurred. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=204.76s)]
*  So the public on its way to work [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=206.88s)]
*  could have helped likely they would [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=209.04s)]
*  have been captured by now if she had. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  But the tips are coming in in terms [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=213.2s)]
*  of an Uber driver believe that he [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=215.28s)]
*  had one individual in the back of his car. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=217.24s)]
*  He was able to show the US Marshal [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=219.88s)]
*  Service where he picked him up, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=222.16s)]
*  where he dropped him off, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=223.96s)]
*  described who was with him. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=225.4s)]
*  There's also people who are providing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=226.96s)]
*  this information as well, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=229.16s)]
*  so it's important to synthesize this [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=230.36s)]
*  with our digital forensics to make sure [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  they were actually getting accurate information. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=234.68s)]
*  There's some members of the public [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=237.0s)]
*  who are trying to throw us off the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=238.88s)]
*  tracks of these individuals, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=241.28s)]
*  but there's a lot of good people [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=242.56s)]
*  who realize how important it is [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=244.56s)]
*  that they do their part and I [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  can't thank them enough. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=248.24s)]
*  You mentioned the sheriff who [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  oversees the jail that was [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=251.52s)]
*  where these inmates escaped. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=253.28s)]
*  She announced that she is suspending [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=254.8s)]
*  her reelection campaign calling [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=256.88s)]
*  the jailbreak a failure. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=258.4s)]
*  Some have called for her resignation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=259.56s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=261.84s)]
*  What does accountability look like? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=262.8s)]
*  I think accountability looks like having [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=265.56s)]
*  all 10 of these individuals back in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=267.24s)]
*  custody prosecuted for the crime, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=268.76s)]
*  the new crimes they've committed [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=271.0s)]
*  and prosecuting anyone who's helped [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=272.64s)]
*  them because they put the they put [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=274.92s)]
*  the public at risk and put us in grave danger. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=277.6s)]
*  What happened with the sheriff? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=281.2s)]
*  That's something that an electorate has to decide. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=283.0s)]
*  This is an utter failure of leadership, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=285.68s)]
*  of management. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=288.16s)]
*  Some sheriffs have the responsibility [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=289.28s)]
*  of policing a county or parish as well [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=291.52s)]
*  as overseeing the jail. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=294.88s)]
*  Her only job is care custody and control [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=296.8s)]
*  of the inmates in that facility. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=298.88s)]
*  And the fact that they didn't have eyes on [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=300.72s)]
*  to realize that these individuals were [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGUiuhZI4k&t=303.2s)]
