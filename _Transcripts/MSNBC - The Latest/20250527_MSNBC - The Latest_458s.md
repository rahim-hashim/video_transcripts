# ‘He’s playing with fire!': Trump ramps up rhetoric against Putin
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU)
*  Joining us now, NBC's Vaughn Hilliard and Mark Polymeropoulos, former CIA chief of operations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=0.0s)]
*  in Europe and Eurasia and an MSNBC national security and intelligence analyst. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=5.72s)]
*  So Vaughn, just days ago, Trump said Putin had gone absolutely crazy. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=11.06s)]
*  Russia questioned whether Trump was suffering from emotional overload. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=15.48s)]
*  What do we know about this, first of all, potential prisoner change, but in general, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=19.92s)]
*  the White House approach to Russia right now? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=24.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=26.88s)]
*  We're still waiting for confirmation from the White House or State Department about [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  this purported prisoner exchange between the United States and Russia. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  As you noted, this would be a new deal, one in which could signal continued cooperation [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=35.28s)]
*  between Russia and the United States, an open line of communication at a time in which there [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=41.62s)]
*  are serious questions about greater peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine going [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=46.44s)]
*  forward. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=51.36s)]
*  For their own part, there is still underway several hundred Russian and Ukraine prisoners [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=52.36s)]
*  that are currently being swapped here over the course of this weekend. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=57.4s)]
*  But there are no official talks on the books. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=61.36s)]
*  Russia had suggested that potentially there could be negotiations at the Vatican, but [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=65.76s)]
*  they said that they would not agree to that as a venue. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=70.16s)]
*  Kyiv Kellogg, the special envoy to Russia and Ukraine for this White House, suggested [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=73.28s)]
*  the talks could take place in Geneva instead. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=77.92s)]
*  But so far, Putin has not agreed to meet face to face with Zelensky. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=81.24s)]
*  This comes after four days of more than a hundred missile strikes inside of Ukraine [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=85.4s)]
*  in a social media post just in the last few minutes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=91.6s)]
*  President Trump again calling out explicitly President Putin, saying that he doesn't realize [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=94.68s)]
*  is that if it weren't for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=100.16s)]
*  Russia. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=104.16s)]
*  And I mean really bad. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=105.16s)]
*  He's playing with fire in that post, threatening the president of Russia, though with unspecified [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=106.16s)]
*  whether that would be sanctions or further military cooperation between the U.S. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=111.38000000000001s)]
*  and Ukraine. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=116.22s)]
*  But acknowledging in that social media post, notably Chris, that the U.S. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=117.22s)]
*  could have made the circumstances for Russia much more difficult over the last months. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=121.5s)]
*  I will note that three months ago I had a conversation with a senior administration [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=126.86s)]
*  official at this White House who had suggested that a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=131.22s)]
*  was just one or two months away. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=136.3s)]
*  We are now one month past that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=138.78s)]
*  So still, there are a lot of questions about whether Russia is really willing to cooperate [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=140.42s)]
*  and bring this war to an end. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  Chris. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=146.94s)]
*  Well, Mark, obviously, Donald Trump has been increasingly public about his frustration with [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=147.94s)]
*  Putin and the lack of progress on a peace deal, although saying really bad things could [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=151.78s)]
*  happen is another level. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=156.34s)]
*  Europe hasn't been waiting on Washington. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=159.94s)]
*  Last week, the EU announced new sanctions on Russia. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=161.74s)]
*  Germany just lifted all range restrictions on the weapons it gives Ukraine. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=164.98s)]
*  In your view, what is this relationship between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=170.06s)]
*  What's Trump getting at now? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=178.38s)]
*  Well, Chris, it's kind of ironic because in the last true social post, Donald Trump almost [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=180.58s)]
*  admits to having helped Russia previously. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=185.78s)]
*  It's quite remarkable saying that, well, bad things could happen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=189.38s)]
*  Well, bad things should have been happening, such as sanctions, such as weapons flows to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=192.54s)]
*  the Ukrainians. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=196.9s)]
*  And they have not. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=197.9s)]
*  The world is watching to see if Donald Trump is ever going to get tough with Putin, something [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=199.22s)]
*  that he's not seemingly wanted to do previously. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=204.54s)]
*  There's a sanctions package sitting in the Senate that apparently is veto proof that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=208.54000000000002s)]
*  would put 500 percent tariffs on countries that essentially trade in Russian oil and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  gas. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=216.86s)]
*  There's also the possibility of more weapons shipments. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=217.86s)]
*  We could allow the Europeans to transfer kind of U.S. kit to the Ukrainians. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=220.02s)]
*  We could actually sell weapons to the Ukrainians as well. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=224.5s)]
*  But all of this is just right now just a little bit tougher talk from Trump, but he [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=227.5s)]
*  hasn't done anything yet. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=232.3s)]
*  And one of the things, Chris, I think we should understand is there's a lot of GOP angst over [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=233.46s)]
*  this. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=237.78s)]
*  There are hawks within the Republican Party. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=238.78s)]
*  Do they really want to be complicit in what is happening now, this inaction and watching [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=240.78s)]
*  Ukraine just getting pounded day after day? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=244.82s)]
*  And the economist, Mark, is reporting on a change in Russia's war strategy, quote, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=248.14s)]
*  A year ago, for 30 drones to strike Ukraine in a single night would be exceptional. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=252.98s)]
*  Now Russia is saturating Ukraine's air defenses with hundreds of them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=257.9s)]
*  On Sunday, 298 drones and 69 missiles were fired into Ukraine. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=262.02s)]
*  Ukraine says it has documents suggesting Russia intends to ramp up its drone production to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=268.06s)]
*  500 a day from 300 a month ago or a year ago. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=273.02s)]
*  How long can Ukraine continue to defend against this? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=278.74s)]
*  I mean, from a war standpoint, how urgent is it if Trump is going to do something to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=282.7s)]
*  do it fast? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=289.62s)]
*  Well, right, Chris, and it's all about air defense right now. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=291.66s)]
*  So what would help Ukraine tremendously is additional Patriot missile systems. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=294.1s)]
*  This is the air defense system that has been extremely effective. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=298.82s)]
*  They're running very low on this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=301.62s)]
*  The U.S. is reluctant to provide more. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  The Pentagon certainly believes they need them for the Indo-Pacific. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=306.54s)]
*  Some of our allies have them and they've been reluctant as well to transfer them. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=310.42s)]
*  But it could be done if we if we deem it a necessity. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=314.18s)]
*  And this would help in what is these attacks, not only, of course, by these drones, the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=317.62s)]
*  Shaheed drones, but also ballistic missiles as well. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=322.1s)]
*  Now, on the battlefield itself, we don't see large swaths of territory being lost. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=325.42s)]
*  The Russians are making some moves. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=331.5s)]
*  The Ukrainians have been really ingenious in producing their own short range drones, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=333.38s)]
*  which in essence allow for the lines to be stable. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=337.74s)]
*  But this has a lot to do right now with just, you know, in essence, terrorism. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=341.94s)]
*  This is Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilians. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=345.74s)]
*  It is terrible for morale in terms of the battlefield itself. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=349.46s)]
*  Not I don't think as as important. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=353.09999999999997s)]
*  But again, the Ukrainians need U.S. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=354.82s)]
*  kit. They need Europeans to step up. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=356.7s)]
*  If there's any time where you need, you know, sanctions to the max and arming Ukraine to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=359.65999999999997s)]
*  the teeth, it's right now. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=364.34s)]
*  I mean, you mentioned ballistic missiles in addition to the drones, but many of those [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=365.78000000000003s)]
*  ballistic missiles from North Korea and there's this new generation of drones that it relies [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=369.06s)]
*  on A.I., not GPS, and that makes them immune to jamming and other electronic warfare, as [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=373.74s)]
*  I understand it. At least that's what Ukrainian engineers say. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=379.3s)]
*  The war today is being fought differently, right? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=382.62s)]
*  It's a different war from the one that started three years ago. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=386.82s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=390.02s)]
*  Well, it's absolutely remarkable. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=392.42s)]
*  There's so much kind of in the national security world that is being discussed on this is how [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=393.9s)]
*  the nature of warfare has changed. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=397.62s)]
*  Again, drones are basically everything. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=399.98s)]
*  And as I just mentioned before, the Ukrainians ability to indigenously produce these short [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=402.18s)]
*  range drones has proved very effective. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=406.5s)]
*  Of course, the Russians are very adept at using the drones as well. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=409.18s)]
*  You know, Chris, the U.S. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=412.98s)]
*  military is looking at this very, very closely because the future of warfare is being fought [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=413.9s)]
*  really on a land war in Europe. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=419.18s)]
*  And everyone is learning lessons. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  And don't forget, you know, what the U.S., the National Defense Strategy always looks [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=422.66s)]
*  at is a future war with with China over Taiwan. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=427.26s)]
*  So many lessons are being learned on the battlefields of Europe. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=431.46000000000004s)]
*  Mark Polymeropoulos, thank you. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Bxnr1gjlU&t=435.82s)]
