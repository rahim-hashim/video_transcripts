# What to do if you see — or experience — Trump’s heavy-handed deportation policies at play

*  Salvador would you call this what you're seeing right there on the screen would [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=52.68s)]
*  you call this deportation in America? What happened to these people? How would [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=58.8s)]

*  process before people can be deprived of their liberty. This week on Morning Mika [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  tough deportation forced removals or outright kidnapping I'm Mika Brzezinski [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=95.56s)]
*  here with Simone Sanders Townsend, Huma Abedin and Jen Psaki and our special [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=101.88s)]
*  guest today is MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin. Arbrega Garcia's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=107.36s)]
*  story has become a flashpoint in the debate over Trump's immigration policy [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=112.56s)]
*  and his campaign promise of mass deportations. Arbrega Garcia's family [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  says the 29 year old husband and father of three in Maryland fled gang violence [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=122.72s)]
*  in El Salvador as a teenager and built a life in the United States. Last month [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=128.88s)]
*  despite a court order protecting him from deportation, Arbrega Garcia was taken [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=134.72s)]
*  by ICE agents accused of gang affiliation based on unverified claims and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=140.08s)]
*  was removed and sent with this group to El Salvador where he was initially [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=146.6s)]
*  locked up in one of the country's most notorious prisons, a prison where inmates [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=153.0s)]
*  reportedly never see the light of day, where there have been documented [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  systematic physical beatings, torture and intentional denial of access to food, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=165.56s)]
*  water, clothing and health care. The Supreme Court has since ruled that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=172.6s)]
*  Arbrega Garcia's deportation or forced removal was unlawful and ordered the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=178.04s)]
*  government to bring him back. But the Trump administration has resisted and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=183.32s)]
*  lawmakers from both parties have been critical of Trump's actions, calling [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=188.12s)]
*  this a massive failure of justice. This case is about more than just one man [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=192.52s)]
*  and what he may or may not have done. It is about due process, accountability [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  and the very real consequences of getting it wrong. Everyone deserves equal [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=206.52s)]
*  protection under the law. Everyone deserves due process and it's not just [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=213.32s)]
*  one man being denied those fundamental rights. Take Andri Jose Hernandez [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  Romero, a gay Venezuelan makeup artist seeking asylum in the U.S. who was [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=226.18s)]
*  wrongly identified as a gang member and deported to that same mega prison in [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=231.68s)]
*  El Salvador or Eduardo Nunes Gonzalez, a Miami man detained by ICE while [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=237.44s)]
*  taking out the garbage or 29 year old Juan Francisco Mendez. ICE agents were [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=244.28s)]
*  seen smashing his car window in Massachusetts and detaining him. A [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=250.6s)]
*  Guatemalan man seeking asylum in the U.S. Trump TV will tell you that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=255.56s)]
*  Democrats don't want criminals and gang members to be thrown out of the country. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=261.44s)]
*  No, everyone wants criminals and gang members to be put into jail where they [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=265.68s)]
*  can't hurt people again. And yet here in America, even criminals deserve the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=271.48s)]
*  presumption of innocence and due process under the law, whether they are [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=278.56s)]
*  illegal immigrants or American citizens. None of these men accused of being gang [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=284.0s)]
*  members got the chance to prove otherwise. And in many cases they are [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=291.2s)]
*  being defamed by the president himself or his attorney general and many more. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=296.56s)]
*  Even influential podcast host and prominent supporter of Donald Trump, Joe [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  Rogan is criticizing this and the president. Take a listen. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=307.64s)]
*  You got to get scared that people who are not criminals are getting like [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=313.36s)]
*  lassoed up and deported and sent to like El Salvador prisons. This is kind of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  crazy that that could be possible. That's horrific. And that's again, that's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=325.48s)]
*  bad for the cause. Like the cause is let's get the gang members out. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=329.36s)]
*  Everybody agrees. But what's not innocent gay hairdressers get lumped up with the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=332.44s)]
*  gangs? And then like how long before that guy can get out? Can we figure out [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=336.24s)]
*  how to get him out? Does ever is there any plan in place to alert the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=340.8s)]
*  authorities that they've made a horrible mistake and correct it? Like we [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=344.48s)]
*  have to make sure that these people are actually guilty. Otherwise we become [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=347.68s)]
*  monsters. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  Lisa Rubin, I mean, there's no one better. You always make me want to go to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=353.68s)]
*  law school every time I talk to you. And I know that's probably true for all of [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=356.64000000000004s)]
*  us. I think this has been such an education for so many of us about what [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=359.68s)]
*  the law allows for and doesn't. And a law does not allow for a lot of what the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=363.5s)]
*  administration is doing. But help us understand. We saw Senator Van Hollen [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=367.04s)]
*  talk about this. But what is the legal definition of deportation versus what [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=370.64s)]
*  is actually happening to these men? Because I think we've all been trying to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=375.2s)]
*  change our language and vernacular on this a bit. But what's the legal [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  definition? Jen, the legal definition of deportation is the formal process of [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=381.28s)]
*  taking someone from this country and removing them to a different country, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=387.52s)]
*  including and usually their country of origin, but subject to the immigration [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=392.4s)]
*  laws and the Constitution of the United States. And so I'm really glad that you [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=398.47999999999996s)]
*  guys are focused on the language here because as Senator Van Hollen shared [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  with you, what is happening here doesn't doesn't fit within that construct of [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=406.4s)]
*  deportation. It looks more like an abduction or what I would call a forced [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=413.84s)]
*  removal without due process. And of course, the word deportation doesn't [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=418.67999999999995s)]
*  include within it holding somebody in law enforcement custody. It just means [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=423.0s)]
*  taking them from point A to point B. And many of the people who are lawfully [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=428.0s)]
*  deported from this country, in fact, that is what happens to them. They no [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=432.2s)]
*  longer have the right to be in the United States, but they are repatriated [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=435.24s)]
*  to their own country of origin where they are released and then can fold back [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=439.04s)]
*  into the general population. So when we talk about deportation, usually we're [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=443.72s)]
*  not talking about anything that results in the custody of people in another [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=447.64s)]
*  country, much less their forced imprisonment in a notorious facility like [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=452.0s)]
*  CICOT in El Salvador. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, Lisa, I think putting the definition on the table and making sure [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=458.88s)]
*  we get it right is so important. I'm wondering what your take is on just [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=462.56s)]
*  what people can do to protect themselves or if they are approached by [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=467.71999999999997s)]
*  an ICE agent or someone who is identifying themselves as an agent of the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  government, because it does feel like a very scary time to be here if you are [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=476.03999999999996s)]
*  an undocumented person, if you are an asylum seeker, if you are someone that is [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=480.28000000000003s)]
*  a permanent legal residence, if you do have a visa that is here, or even if [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=484.6s)]
*  you're an American citizen who happens to look like you are an undocumented [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=490.08s)]
*  person, i.e. Latino, I mean, because we have examples of American citizens [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=496.16s)]
*  being detained as well. So what rights do people have? Because Eduardo Nunez [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=501.2s)]
*  Gonzalez, he was taking out his trash. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=508.48s)]
*  Well, let's stop, Simone, and maybe divide the world for a second. I want to [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=511.8s)]
*  take a step back and divide the world into a before and after, because [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=515.16s)]
*  immigration advocates will tell you that there are lots of things, in fact, that [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=518.68s)]
*  you can do well before you have an encounter with ICE or local police that [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=521.76s)]
*  leads to an immigration detention. So the first thing that I would tell people [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=526.8s)]
*  is think about if you have children who a backup caregiver in your life is, who [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=531.32s)]
*  has an undisputed right to stay in this country, and then make arrangements not [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=536.04s)]
*  only with that person, but with any school that your child attends, any day [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=540.84s)]
*  care that they attend, that they know to contact that backup caregiver if you [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=545.6s)]
*  cannot be reached. And of course, it's important that that backup caregiver is [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=550.56s)]
*  himself or herself, somebody who has the right to be here. The other thing that [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=554.2s)]
*  you can do to prevent a confrontation is carrying your papers with you at all [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=559.48s)]
*  times. So if you are a lawful permanent resident of this country, for example, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=564.84s)]
*  make sure your green card is with you at all times. If you're here, pursue it to [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=568.88s)]
*  a student visa. Similarly, bring those papers with you, have them on your [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=572.76s)]
*  person so that you're never in a dispute over whether you are who you say you [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=577.24s)]
*  are. For example, when you showed that footage of the guy whose window was [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=582.4s)]
*  smashed in, that started with a case of mistaken identity. They were looking for [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=586.12s)]
*  a particular person. They kept insisting that he was that man, and he was not, in [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=590.2s)]
*  fact, that man, but nonetheless got caught up in ICE detention because he is [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=594.24s)]
*  a person without legal status in this country. So those are two important [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  things people can do from the outset. Now you asked what can you do if you have [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=602.5600000000001s)]
*  law enforcement interaction? When you show that gentleman who was taking out [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=607.96s)]
*  his trash, there is a difference, at least in terms of how the immigration law [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=613.0s)]

*  notorious maximum security prison in El Salvador. What did you find out about [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=787.56s)]
*  the conditions there? Well, the this infamously notorious prison that we've [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=793.9799999999999s)]
*  already referred to in the earlier in the in the program. See, coat was built [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=800.92s)]
*  in 2023. It's got eight pavilions that hold up to 40,000 inmates from by all [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=806.8399999999999s)]
*  reports. It's got metal bunks, no sheets, no pillows, mattresses. It's got open [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=813.36s)]
*  toilets. It's part of a prison system where 108,000 people are crammed into [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=819.32s)]
*  spaces meant for 70,000 inmates. They're cut out off from the outside world. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=823.5600000000001s)]
*  Their reports of just dismal, horrific conditions, torture and death. Our own [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=828.84s)]
*  U. S. State Department described these conditions as life threatening and local [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=833.5600000000001s)]
*  human rights groups have said that almost 350 people have died since 2022. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=838.72s)]
*  And you know, the Human Rights Report Human Rights Watch rather had a report [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=845.36s)]
*  for March where they themselves were denied access. But doctors who visited [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=850.0799999999999s)]
*  inmates there said cases of malnutrition of fungal infections of evidence of [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=855.0s)]
*  severe malnutrition was normal in what they saw. And one of the formerly [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=861.4399999999999s)]
*  detained inmates was an 18 year old construction worker that that the Human [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=866.66s)]
*  Rights Watch interviewed. And he said that new inmates in the prison system [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=871.86s)]
*  were beaten for the first hour by a baton one so hard until one of his ribs [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=877.9s)]
*  cracked. This 18 year old former inmate also said that the cells were so [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=884.52s)]
*  overcrowded that you either had to sleep on the floor or sleep standing. And, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=890.26s)]
*  you know, to the point that Lisa was saying earlier in the show, I spoke with [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=896.12s)]
*  the attorney of Andre Jose Hernandez Romero yesterday and she herself said [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=901.32s)]
*  that since her client was taken five weeks ago, the word that she used was [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=907.62s)]
*  disappeared or rendered. She's had no access. His family has had no access. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=914.26s)]
*  They have no information about his condition. And the term that she used [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=920.66s)]
*  that Bukele himself has called this, you know, the term she was a curated [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=926.5s)]
*  torture tour. The only people who have access get a very specific show, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=930.98s)]
*  frankly, a show that our government pays for because we've paid our [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=938.3199999999999s)]
*  administration. This administration is paid to have prisoners incarcerated [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=942.9s)]
*  there and that their only recourse is through these habeas petitions. In fact, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=946.86s)]
*  they had a hearing in San Diego yesterday, which was the third hearing [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=953.9s)]
*  that they had. And it remains to be seen what her what her clients condition [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=957.9s)]
*  is in. And so many other people are in a very similar situation. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=964.1s)]
*  Simone, President Trump has said his administration is actively exploring a [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=967.9s)]
*  proposal to detain U.S. citizens. He calls them homegrowns and send them to [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=971.66s)]
*  prisons in El Salvador. If he can find the legal loophole to do it, is nothing [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=977.74s)]
*  off limits? I mean, Mika, I mean, it's a very good question. You know, President [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=983.74s)]
*  Trump said he was actually caught on a live stream saying this that was being [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=988.78s)]
*  live streamed by President Bukele, the Salvadorian president from his team in [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=993.5799999999999s)]
*  the Oval Office. And the president, President Trump, looked to President Bukele [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=999.14s)]
*  and noted the homegrowns are next. You're going to need more prisons. And then [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1002.9s)]
*  when asked about that interaction in the Oval Office sitting next to President [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1007.86s)]
*  Bukele, the president hedged a bid and said, oh, well, we're if it's legal, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1012.46s)]
*  but I do think that we should get the criminals out. And and, you know, Supreme [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1016.66s)]
*  Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor put out a statement a couple of weeks ago, and [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1021.02s)]
*  she said that the Trump administration's legal arguments around deportation [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1024.82s)]
*  suggest that, quote, the U.S. government already believes it could deport and [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1029.26s)]
*  incarcerate any person, including U.S. citizens, without legal consequence, so [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1033.3000000000002s)]
*  long as it does so before a court can intervene. President Trump has directed [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1038.1000000000001s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi to see if it is possible, if it is legal to to take [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1044.1000000000001s)]
*  people who have been convicted of crimes and are imprisoned here in the United [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1049.7800000000002s)]
*  States and send them to this El Salvadorian prison. But I just want to be [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1053.22s)]
*  very clear as someone that grew up doing juvenile justice reform work, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1056.58s)]
*  this is not legal. And this is going to be played out in the courts. But what [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1062.5s)]
*  the president, this administration is doing is they are stress testing the [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1068.8999999999999s)]
*  system. They are stress testing the system of Congress. They're stress testing [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1072.82s)]
*  our legal system and they're stress testing the powers of the executive [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1076.58s)]
*  branch. And this is a really, really, really big test that, frankly, a lot of [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1080.7s)]
*  people are going to need to not just pay attention to but be proactive about if [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1087.9s)]
*  we say this is not who we are as Americans. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1092.7s)]
*  So to Simone's point, Jen, who are you looking to in terms of elected officials [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1095.18s)]
*  who would be able to step up to halt what is clearly illegal, wrongful, I call [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1100.9s)]
*  them forced removals. It doesn't really seem like the deportation process is [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1108.82s)]
*  respected here at all. And what needs to happen? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1113.1s)]
*  We have seen some, which is encouraging, some elected officials, Senator Van [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1117.62s)]
*  Holland, obviously you played him earlier. We've seen some members of the [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1122.02s)]
*  House, Democrats in the House, go down to El Salvador and try to keep the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1125.94s)]
*  spotlight on what is happening to these men and these illegal renderings, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1129.3799999999999s)]
*  whatever you want to call them. It certainly doesn't even, it feels like [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1134.98s)]
*  using the word deportations, I think we've all learned, is not doing justice [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1137.9s)]
*  to how outrageous and illegal this is. So there is some of that happening. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1141.5s)]
*  That's a good thing. I think the courts are obviously taking steps, not in a [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1145.3000000000002s)]
*  political way, but there are steps and some legal experts have suggested that [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1149.6200000000001s)]
*  some members of the administration could be held in contempt for their activity [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1155.38s)]
*  here. Will that change the Trump administration? We don't know yet. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1159.74s)]
*  I think the challenge here, which is what we're all grappling with, is that it's [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1163.6200000000001s)]
*  up to the Trump administration and or the courts or the Trump administration to [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1168.0200000000002s)]
*  abide by the courts in order to bring many of these men back. I will note Mika [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1171.38s)]
*  because we've all talked about immigration. It is an interesting, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1176.3400000000001s)]
*  humane issue, but an interesting political issue. Trump's border security [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1179.74s)]
*  steps, his support for stronger actions at the border are supported by more [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1184.7s)]
*  Americans than most Democrats want to always acknowledge. That is a truth and [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1189.8999999999999s)]
*  something that is an important takeaway from 2024. At the same time, and there [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1193.98s)]
*  have been a couple of polls and I just want to cite one, when you ask people [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1198.58s)]
*  specifically, and I'm just using the phrasing in here, whether or not, whether [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1202.06s)]
*  or not Kimar Abrego-Garcia should be brought back to the United States from [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1207.22s)]
*  El Salvador, 50% of Americans say yes, 28% say no. And I think this is important [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1211.98s)]
*  to note because when you get into the specifics of what Trump is doing, it's [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0rVcjpvjh0&t=1219.7s)]
