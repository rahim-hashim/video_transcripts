Video Description: Under Donald Trump, Americans are witnessing the most sweeping attempt yet to dismantle federal regulations. The cuts impact nearly every facet of American life, from the water every American drinks to the wages every worker earns. The DOGE approach is dangerous for everyday Americans who rely on these vital safeguards, according to Sheila Bair, former chair of the FDIC. “You don’t need a chainsaw—you need a thoughtful, strategic approach,” Bair says, adding that regulators need to be involved in any attempts at reform. “They really have the expertise, and they are in the best place to understand where you can cut without causing damage,” she explains. “Learn from their expertise in being more surgical.”

# What’s a world without federal regulations? It gets dark real quick…
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY)
*  When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Social Security into law 90 years ago, he said it would offer Americans a measure of protection from the hazards and vicissitudes of life. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=0.0s)]
*  And for nearly a century, it's done that, shielding workers and families from the heaviest blows of aging, disability, and the loss of a breadwinner. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=10.0s)]
*  FDR's legacy as president is one of profound transformation. He led the nation through the Great Depression and World War II, and he redefined what Americans should expect from their leaders. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=18.0s)]
*  Above all, Roosevelt believed government was not meant to serve the powerful. It was meant to protect and uplift ordinary people. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=28.0s)]
*  Fast forward 90 years today, and we're witnessing the most sweeping attempt yet to dismantle the protective shield of government. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=35.0s)]
*  Not just in the attempted shredding of the social safety net, but in all-out assaults on federal safeguards. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=42.0s)]
*  Agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=49.0s)]
*  All of them have been stripped of power and purpose. And it's not a partisan take. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=57.0s)]
*  Experts say that Trump's policies froze or dismantled protections across nearly every facet of American life. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=62.0s)]
*  From the water every Republican and Democrat drinks, to the wages that every independent and libertarian earns. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=67.0s)]
*  It's not about making America great again. It's about making it easier for corporations to pollute, to underpay, to overcharge, and deny care at the expense of everyone else. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=74.0s)]
*  Regulations built over decades to prevent cancer, injury, wage theft, and abuse are being gutted. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=83.0s)]
*  And the consequences are yet to be felt. But what does all of this look like in a real person's life? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=90.0s)]
*  Let's bring our friend Betty back to the show to show us why some regulations actually matter. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=96.0s)]
*  And how every single American is going to suffer one way or another if the government stops protecting people and starts serving the oligarchy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=101.0s)]
*  Now, if you've not joined us for one of her tales before, meet Betty. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=109.0s)]
*  She's a working mother raising her teenage son, Bobby, who is now taller than she is, in a modest neighborhood just outside the city. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=112.0s)]
*  They're not rich, but Betty's always gotten by. That's before the factory opened. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=119.0s)]
*  A few months after it started operating close to her neighborhood, thanks to new relaxed air and water pollution rules, neighbors began waking up with headaches and sore throats and chest tightness. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=124.0s)]
*  Betty chalked it up to allergies, but soon she was in and out of urgent care. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=134.0s)]
*  And two years later, she got the diagnosis leukemia. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=138.0s)]
*  Doctors linked the spike in cancer cases to toxic chemicals that the factory was allowed to emit after the gutting of the EPA, an agency, by the way, created by Republican President Richard Nixon. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=141.0s)]
*  At the same time, her son Bobby got sick after eating chicken that was tainted with Listeria, a direct consequence of the U.S. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=152.0s)]
*  Department of Agriculture's rollback, which replaced some federal inspectors with corporate ones and sped up meat production lines. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=159.0s)]
*  Betty had to take medical leave. But one afternoon at work, she overheard her boss say she was being let go because now she's a liability to the company. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=166.0s)]
*  She tried to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but the administration had fired two of its commissioners, leaving the agency toothless and overwhelmed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=174.0s)]
*  Workplace discrimination has an impact on around 80,000 people per year. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=183.0s)]
*  And those are just the formal complaints. Actually, most of these things go unresolved. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=187.0s)]
*  And, of course, then came the bills. Betty applied for Medicaid, but budget cuts made to fund an almost $5 trillion tax break for the wealthiest Americans made it easier to deny her coverage and harder to access life-saving medication. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=192.0s)]
*  Her claim was rejected with no insurance, no job and a growing stack of bills. Betty filed for medical bankruptcy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=206.0s)]
*  She's far from alone, by the way. Each year, more than half a million American families are forced to do the same, often because of illness, job loss or both. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=213.0s)]
*  In fact, medical debt in the U.S. hits the middle class the hardest. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=222.0s)]
*  It now accounts for nearly two-thirds of all bankruptcy filings in the United States. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=225.0s)]
*  And America does stand alone amongst developed countries where medical debt is the leading cause of personal bankruptcy. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=230.0s)]
*  Well, the one bright spot is seeing Bobby graduate from high school. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=237.0s)]
*  His lifelong dream was to be a doctor, just like his grandfather and his uncle. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=240.0s)]
*  But Bobby's dream may never become a reality because the administration gutted federal student aid. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=244.0s)]
*  They cut Pell Grant funding and they restricted student loan eligibility. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=248.0s)]
*  And after Betty's bankruptcy, there's no way they can afford tuition out of pocket, even at a state college. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=252.0s)]
*  Experts warn that new education policies could create a two-tiered system where college is only accessible to the affluent, while kids like Bobby are forced to abandon their dreams. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=257.0s)]
*  So Bobby took a warehouse job instead to help his mom pay for the groceries and medicine. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=267.0s)]
*  One day, Bobby, who you may recall has gotten pretty strong from spending so much time at the gym, threw his back out working the long hours. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=272.0s)]
*  But thanks to the administration's plan to slash the workforce and shut down several regional offices of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=278.0s)]
*  it's unclear whether anyone will even be able to investigate his injury. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=285.0s)]
*  Since its creation, OSHA has reduced workplace deaths by nearly two-thirds, even as the U.S. workforce has more than doubled. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=290.0s)]
*  Today, about six million workers suffer from job-related harms each year, a number that's likely to rise if labor protections continue to be gutted. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=298.0s)]
*  So Betty and Bobby can't catch a break, and now Bobby's out of work too. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=307.0s)]
*  Without a college degree, he'll join the 60 percent of Americans without higher education, who on average earn far less and face higher unemployment risk. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=310.0s)]
*  This was not the life Betty had envisioned for herself and her son, but when the federal government prioritizes profit over people, families like theirs suffer first, and they won't be the last. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=319.0s)]
*  Bobby's dream is a dream deferred. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=329.0s)]
*  Joining me to discuss why regulations matter is Sheila Baer. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=332.0s)]
*  She's the former chair of the FDIC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=336.0s)]
*  She's also the founding chair of the Systemic Risk Council. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=339.0s)]
*  She's the author of the book Bull by the Horns, Fighting to Save Main Street from Wall Street and Wall Street from Itself. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=342.0s)]
*  Sheila, it's good to see you. Thank you for being with us. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=348.0s)]
*  I think the point here is that none of us want regulations that are not good, that don't serve a purpose, that come in the way of doing business or getting things done. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=350.0s)]
*  But you can't take regulations are like tariffs. Some of them are good. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=362.0s)]
*  Some of them are bad. They're tools used to achieve something. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=365.0s)]
*  They're not. They're neither good nor a bad thing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=367.0s)]
*  They're just a tool. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=369.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=371.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, I think I'm a markets oriented person, but markets don't always function properly, especially when you have what economists call information asymmetries between the public and the business that may be providing whatever product or service that the public may be consuming. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=372.0s)]
*  So that's why we need health and safety regulations. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=388.0s)]
*  That's why we need financial regulations, because financial products can be highly complex and sometimes abusive. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=391.0s)]
*  And that's why you need the government to step in and to protect the public. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=397.0s)]
*  As you say, that doesn't mean that all the regulations are good. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=400.0s)]
*  That doesn't. And I think regulators, it's really incumbent upon them to have efficient regulations, sensible regulations, regulations that could be explained to the public so they understand their value and purpose. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=403.0s)]
*  And I think that might be how we've gotten our sit or the political dynamic going now. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=414.0s)]
*  And we see this as regulation, especially financial regulation, the pendulum always swings too far one way or the other, too far towards regulation and back too far to deregulation. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=419.0s)]
*  And then that can be very, very dangerous when it comes to our financial system, because if the financial system gets into trouble, the whole economy gets into trouble. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=429.0s)]
*  And we've seen that time and again throughout history when ill-advised deregulatory moves have caused financial crisis and economic hardship. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=437.0s)]
*  So part of it is that when regulation works, the good news is you don't really know it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=444.0s)]
*  You don't really understand it. So you and I have been talking about this for more than 15 years, right? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=449.0s)]
*  During the financial crisis in 2008. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=453.0s)]
*  You know, I've explained to people that a bank would shut down on a Friday afternoon and you and the FDIC would announce that you can access your money, go to the bank machine with your ATM. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=455.0s)]
*  You can get your money all weekend. And on Monday, it will open up under the ownership of a different bank. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=466.0s)]
*  The whole transaction was done. The FDIC oversaw the whole transaction. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=470.0s)]
*  The consumer of the bank was unaware of the whole thing. And it was a seamless operation. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=474.0s)]
*  Banks failed, but there wasn't a run on the banks because there were regulators on top of this whole thing. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=480.0s)]
*  How many people lost money in an FDIC insured account in the financial crisis? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=486.0s)]
*  Zero. No one. No one has ever lost a penny of insured. That's right. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=490.0s)]
*  So that's right. And you look at what happened with the market crash in 1929 and the bank failures, the massive bank failures that followed. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=494.0s)]
*  We didn't have deposit insurance. That was one of FDR's innovations under his administration to create the FDIC, which has worked perfectly. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=502.0s)]
*  But then again, talking about that pendulum going far back, I think you and I discussed earlier some early indications for this administration about doing away with the FDIC. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=509.0s)]
*  So I think that's not going to happen. I think they wisely, people gave them a lot of pushback on that, including in the industry. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=518.0s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, it's important. You know, the financial system, even Milton Friedman, Adam Smith, the father of capitalism, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=527.0s)]
*  they argued for the need of financial regulation because the system is prone to recklessness, speculation, high levels of leverage. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=536.0s)]
*  And if the system stops working, it helps. It hurts everybody. It hurts the real economy. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=543.0s)]
*  People need to know their money's safe. People need to know their money's accessible. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=548.0s)]
*  Then when they want to spend it to pay their rent, the groceries, what have you, the economy can't function if they don't have that access and that confidence. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=551.0s)]
*  So that's why, especially in the area of financial regulation, this administration needs to be extremely careful. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=559.0s)]
*  And again, I don't defend everything that has happened. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=565.0s)]
*  I think there is a case that in many areas, regulations are not smart. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=568.0s)]
*  They become overly complex, overly bureaucratic, overly expensive. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=573.0s)]
*  I think, fortunately, Secretary Besant, the Treasury Secretary, seems to be the lead person now on that. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=577.0s)]
*  In the early Doge days, we were hearing, you know, they will limit the FDIC, and I'm still not sure what's going on with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=583.0s)]
*  But I think he's dialed back that a bit. I'm not agreeing with everything they want to do. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=591.0s)]
*  But in terms of better regulatory coordination, simplification, community bank relief, that makes sense. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=595.0s)]
*  But weakening big bank capital standards, making them less stable, that does not make sense. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=601.0s)]
*  So I guess part again, part of the issue here is that I don't know whether we should know more about the regulations around us to be able to say these are good ones and these are bad ones. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=607.0s)]
*  I do notice and I don't know what this has to do with. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=616.0s)]
*  But recently when I go to my phone and I open up my banking app, it has a thing on the top that says your funds are protected by the full faith in the government, full faith in whatever the American government, the FDIC. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=618.0s)]
*  It's like an ad. I don't know whether what's happened here, but good information, right? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=629.0s)]
*  It's a good reminder. Every time I check my bank account, it's protected by a regulation. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=633.0s)]
*  Yes, that's right. It's a very strong ban because it does have that perfect record. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=639.0s)]
*  It's a very good concrete example about how people every day are helped by these programs. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=645.0s)]
*  And obviously providing deposit insurance comes with some level of regulation. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=650.0s)]
*  We just don't give banks insurance protection for their deposits and let them do anything they want with the deposits. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=654.0s)]
*  There's what's called safety and soundness regulation that goes with that to make sure they handle those deposits prudently. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=660.0s)]
*  So don't fail. But if they do fail, the FDIC is there. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=665.0s)]
*  And yeah, I think more than anything for Main Street America, the FDIC is a shining example of how regulation helps helps real people. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=669.0s)]
*  Let's talk about you made an interesting point that maybe Scott Besson's looking into how you deal with it. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=676.0s)]
*  I think every single taxpayer in the country or business owner would say there should be exactly the amount of regulation that is correct and not not two regulations more and not two regulations less. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=680.0s)]
*  But figuring that out, Doge did not seem to have an approach that made sense. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=691.0s)]
*  What does make sense? How do you say I think there might be some regulations that are coming in the way of doing certain things. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=695.0s)]
*  How do we make sure we get rid of those and not the ones that protect people's lives and safety and prosperity and health? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=702.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's right. You don't need a chainsaw. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=708.0s)]
*  You need a thoughtful, strategic approach. And I do think it needs to start with the regulators. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=713.0s)]
*  When I was a regulator, I always encourage simplicity, public communications about what the regulation was was designed to accomplish or a best to comment period to get feedback about whether it would accomplish those objectives. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=717.0s)]
*  But you need some discipline around the rule writing. And I think simplicity is really a key part of that. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=730.0s)]
*  I would tell my staff, you know, if you can't explain it to regular people, there may be something wrong. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=736.0s)]
*  And I do think, especially in the area of what's called bank capital regulations, which governs how much equity, how much skin in the game the bank needs to have, how much of its own shareholder equity it needs to have to fund itself versus using leverage borrowing. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=742.0s)]
*  That's really a key part of system stability, having good, strong capital standards, this cushion for Brazilians. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=756.0s)]
*  And those have become far too complicated. And that makes them vulnerable because people can't explain them. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=764.0s)]
*  So I think this is one of the reasons why these rules are vulnerable now. But it's really up to regulators. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=771.0s)]
*  Keep it simple and explain it. If you can't explain it to the public, there's probably something wrong. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=776.0s)]
*  But defer, this is another issue that's arisen, is the independence of these regulatory agencies. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=781.0s)]
*  They really have the expertise and they are in the best position to understand where you can cut without damage and where you really need these core protections. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=786.0s)]
*  So, you know, I hope that there will be deference to the independent agencies and the great career staff that work there to, you know, learn from their expertise in terms of being more surgical and how you approach financial regulation or any regulation. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=795.0s)]
*  And I would argue doing what you did back in the day, and that is being out there and talking to people about why these regulations matter so that they can, so regular people can understand it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=809.0s)]
*  Sheila, great to see you. Thanks for being with us. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=820.0s)]
*  Sheila Barry, the former chair of the FDIC. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDuvl9DEIY&t=822.0s)]
