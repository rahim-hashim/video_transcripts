# Republicans ‘seem lost in the wilderness’ amidst Trump-Musk breakup: Rep. Stansbury
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw)
*  Congresswoman Sandsbury is joining me right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=0.0s)]
*  She, of course, the ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=2.4s)]
*  Welcome back to the broadcast. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=5.0s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=6.2s)]
*  So when you spoke at that Doge subcommittee on Wednesday, you referenced the breakup between Musk and the GOP over the budget bill. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=6.8s)]
*  I'm curious what song you would want to have played, but we can save that for another time. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=15.3s)]
*  But were you aware a more seismic separation was incoming? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=18.6s)]
*  And I'm curious your reaction to it when it happened. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=22.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think many of us are, you know, have a certain amount of delight in the breakup of this romance, not just because, you know, we're seeing the breakup of ages, but also because it has really important implications for the American people. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=26.3s)]
*  And these two men have terrorized the American people for the last three and a half months, whether it was Musk's totally scam artists effort of Doge, which shattered thousands of lives and dismantled agencies and let children starve across the world. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=42.0s)]
*  Or it's Donald Trump's completely lawless execution and Project 2025 in the way that it's shattering everything from due process to the separation of powers. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=56.0s)]
*  But I think it was very obvious starting around Sunday or Monday that something big was going down between Musk and Trump because Musk started tweeting and, you know, was pretty much out of control for days trying to take down the reconciliation bill. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=65.0s)]
*  And this is Donald Trump's signature legislation for his first term. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=79.8s)]
*  So we knew something was brewing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=84.0s)]
*  How'd your Republican colleagues react to the public spectacle? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=86.8s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=90.0s)]
*  They seem lost in the wilderness right now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=92.0s)]
*  I think, you know, as I was heading to the floor on Thursday, especially as Musk was literally tweeting yes to another tweet that said that Donald Trump should be impeached, I got to the floor and Republicans were kind of walking around acting bewildered. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=96.0s)]
*  And the press was reporting that they didn't know whose side to take. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=113.0s)]
*  We saw, you know, Republicans tweeting themselves like bros. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=117.0s)]
*  We don't want you to break up, get back together. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=121.0s)]
*  And I think it's because, you know, this is one of the most powerful political alliances we've ever seen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=123.0s)]
*  We saw Elon Musk dumped 300 million dollars on Donald Trump's election. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=130.0s)]
*  We don't know what he did on the data side to help Trump win. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=135.0s)]
*  But we know that Trump has been wielding that power over Republicans for the last several months, trying to force them to vote for his bills. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=138.0s)]
*  And now they don't know whose side to take. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=147.0s)]
*  There's a new report which says Doge fired too many people and the Trump administration officials are racing to fix the mistake. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=150.0s)]
*  And one day after you said Musk had not testified before Congress, your GOP colleagues again blocked Democrats attempt to subpoena Musk by delaying a vote because more Democrats were present at the time. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=157.0s)]
*  Let's watch this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=170.0s)]
*  For those of you watching at home, the Republicans are not in the room, so they're trying to find their members so that they can. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=173.0s)]
*  You are not recognized, Ms. Dansberry. Thank you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=179.0s)]
*  You can be quiet now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=181.0s)]
*  Neither any of your members, because they're not in the room. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=182.0s)]
*  Is the only reason we can't take a vote is because you know we're about to lose it? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=185.0s)]
*  How much taxpayer money are Republicans wasting while delaying this vote? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=188.0s)]
*  That's not a legitimate point of inquiry. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=191.0s)]
*  It's very legitimate to the American people. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=193.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=195.0s)]
*  It's not, you're not recognized. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=196.0s)]
*  Very legitimate to the American people. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=197.0s)]
*  So given the riff, do you see a scenario where Musk might voluntarily come in to talk to Democrats? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=199.0s)]
*  I mean about the Doge cuts perhaps, or maybe do it on the sidelines? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=205.0s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=210.0s)]
*  These are highly unpredictable men, both Trump and Musk. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=211.0s)]
*  And I mean, let us not forget that just a week and a half ago, the New York Times broke a story that Musk was potentially using a lot of drugs while on the campaign trail and potentially while he was a special government employee. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=214.0s)]
*  And if you look at his behavior, even while he was tweeting the last few days, it's very erratic. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=226.0s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=231.0s)]
*  I don't think we can pin anything on either of these guys at this moment in terms of reliability. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=233.0s)]
*  But I do know that Musk broke the law, shattered lives, dismantled agencies, stole our data and broke the law. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=239.0s)]
*  And we're going to hold him accountable. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=246.0s)]
*  Now, this, the beautiful thing about living in a democracy is that you get to vote for and support whatever candidates you like. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=248.0s)]
*  So if Musk decides he wants to embrace the Democrats, that's on him. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=254.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we're still going to hold him accountable for what he did. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=258.0s)]
*  So the Washington Post is pointing out that Musk's business empire is built on 38 billion dollars in taxpayer funds and he has benefited greatly from Democrat led administrations. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=263.0s)]
*  And one Musk advisor told NBC News money once earmarked for Trump's use is gone. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=274.0s)]
*  Adding Musk will support Democrats if needed. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=279.0s)]
*  So do you expect Musk to be more congenial at least to Democrats going forward? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=282.0s)]
*  I mean, I think what is obvious is that we have an individual who's the wealthiest man on earth and he is trying to wield his wealth to get more wealth and to have power. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=288.0s)]
*  And so do I think that he will try to use his wealth to continue to have power and make more money? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=300.0s)]
*  Yes. And if that means he supports one candidate versus another or one party versus another, I mean, this is exactly the kind of corruption that the American people are sick of. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=306.0s)]
*  And that is why I hear every single day that we have to get big money out of politics, because this is what's corrupting our system. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=317.0s)]
*  Look, the CBO says that about 11 million people are going to lose health care coverage if Trump's billionaire tax cut bill passes in its current form. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=325.0s)]
*  With an additional four million people losing health insurance when Obamacare subsidies are not extended, the CBO also says the bill would add two point four trillion dollars to the deficit over 10 years. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=333.0s)]
*  Where does this bill stand now after all of Musk's signaling, if you want to call it that? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=343.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think much of what we're watching closely is what the Republicans are going to do next. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=349.0s)]
*  And I think the mass confusion over this romance breakup is really at the heart of that question, because in the wake of Elon Musk's tweets, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=354.0s)]
*  all these Republicans that sold their soul to vote for this bill two weeks ago are suddenly saying, oh, I didn't read the bill. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=364.0s)]
*  I didn't know it actually increased the deficit. Some of them who did vote for it were like, I told you so, guys, we never should have voted for this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=371.0s)]
*  So I think we don't really know how the dust is going to settle. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=378.0s)]
*  But I never underestimate Trump, and I don't think anyone should. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=382.0s)]
*  He will use every tool and piece of power he has to try to get the Senate to shove this through. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=387.0s)]
*  So we can't take our eye off the ball. We have to remain diligent and we have to continue to speak up and to stop this bill in the Senate. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=392.0s)]
*  Yeah. Among those who didn't read the full content of the bill, your colleague, Marjorie Taylor Greene, we should note. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=399.0s)]
*  OK, and she admitted it. I mean, she did flat out. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=404.0s)]
*  Congressman Milne Stansbury, though, it was good to see you. Thank you. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=407.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGvL1pXbzw&t=417.0s)]
