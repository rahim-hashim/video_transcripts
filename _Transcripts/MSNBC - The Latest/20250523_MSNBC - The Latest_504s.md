# 'What is Harvard supposed to do?' University in 'extremely difficult spot' with Trump admin
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU)
*  Joining me now is New York Times investigative reporter and MSNBC national security contributor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=0.0s)]
*  Michael Schmidt and former Brooklyn prosecutor, civil rights attorney and MSNBC legal analyst [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=5.26s)]
*  Charles Coleman. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  So Charles, we knew that this was going to just be a first step when Harvard filed. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  Now a judge has gotten involved. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=16.5s)]
*  Where's this going? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=18.18s)]
*  Well, Chris, right now this is an injunction which is basically going to stop Harvard, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=19.18s)]
*  it's going to allow Harvard to continue to have international students and it's going [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=25.32s)]
*  the federal government from its ban. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=28.740000000000002s)]
*  What I suspect is going to happen is that ultimately the judge is going to look at pretty [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=31.02s)]
*  much how much information has been requested of Harvard, how compliant have they been and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=35.58s)]
*  does the government have the authority to make the sweeping request that it has in terms [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=41.46s)]
*  of getting as much information on these students as it has asked for. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=45.5s)]
*  Now the government on the other hand is going to frame this as a matter of national security [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=49.46s)]
*  which you already talked about and basically say we need this information in order to determine [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=52.74s)]
*  whether any of these people pose a threat not only to the Jewish students on this campus [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=57.24s)]
*  but overall to national security as a whole such that they should not be here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=61.08s)]
*  So ultimately when we have this hearing in a few weeks that's what's going to be assessed [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=65.18s)]
*  by the judge and they're going to ultimately weigh the interest of the university against [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=68.94s)]
*  the interest of as the government will frame it, national security. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=72.84s)]
*  What I think is going to happen here is that the judge is going to ultimately decide how [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=76.4s)]
*  much information the government can actually ask for and then set a timeline that is reasonable [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=81.6s)]
*  for the university to produce it and so long as that takes place the judge is not going [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=87.28s)]
*  to allow this to move forward. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=92.53999999999999s)]
*  What is it that Donald Trump is trying to do here? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=94.64s)]
*  Do we know? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure and I think that the most important thing that's going on here and we've written [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=99.28s)]
*  about this and I've talked about it and folks have talked about it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=107.5s)]
*  Harvard's officials know they are in an extremely difficult spot because they find themselves [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=111.7s)]
*  fighting these multi-front wars with the administration and there's this notion that if Harvard goes [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=118.02s)]
*  to court they were going to get their money back and that they would be okay but they [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=123.7s)]
*  really need that research money for years to come and if let's say they get it back [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=127.28s)]
*  this year they have to go through the Trump administration and Congress to get it in the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=132.18s)]
*  years that follow and this what happened yesterday is yet another example of the problems [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=135.66s)]
*  that they face because they're persona non grata with the administration but at the same [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=141.34s)]
*  time what is Harvard supposed to do? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=145.84s)]
*  Are they supposed to head back to the table and negotiate with Donald Trump? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  As we've seen with the law firms that try to negotiate with Donald Trump there's Donald [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=152.18s)]
*  Trump's understanding of a deal and then there's the other party's understanding of a deal [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=156.78s)]
*  So if you're Harvard you have massive problems and problems in ways that are bigger than [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=161.42s)]
*  the law firms. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=166.74s)]
*  When the law firms got hit with the executive orders they went to court, judges gave them [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=167.78s)]
*  restraining orders similar to what we saw today but the federal government can't stop [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=172.18s)]
*  knock out a quarter of the lawyers at the firm because they're here on visas. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=179.62s)]
*  The federal government can't take away half of the firm's money. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=183.74s)]
*  That's where Harvard finds itself and they find themselves in a really really tough spot. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=187.3s)]
*  What I was just talking to Christine Romans about which is that by one count 41% of foreign [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=191.14000000000001s)]
*  students stay in the United States after they graduate. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=197.02s)]
*  More apparently would like to. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=201.02s)]
*  A lot of them are PhD grads, medical school graduates. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=203.38s)]
*  The Trump administration thinks it's punishing Harvard but is it really punishing the economy? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=206.82s)]
*  Is it punishing businesses who already say that they need highly trained individuals, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=212.66s)]
*  highly educated individuals and they can't necessarily find them? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=219.1s)]
*  If you talk to Harvard folks what they say is that what is going on here cuts to the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=222.7s)]
*  heart of American academia, what academia means, what the United States means to other [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=228.06s)]
*  countries in the world, the idea that we're attracting the best and the brightest from [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=233.14000000000001s)]
*  around the world, the idea that this research money is consequential to not only medicine [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=236.78s)]
*  but aerospace and national security. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=242.5s)]
*  Harvard has struggled to make that argument publicly. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=245.06s)]
*  They have talked to me about it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=248.18s)]
*  I've heard them out about this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=249.58s)]
*  To your point there is a larger impact to what's going on here but Harvard to the larger [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=252.5s)]
*  issue has got a multi-front legal and public relations fight with an administration that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=258.94s)]
*  seems willing to pretty much do anything. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  What they did yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security put out a statement that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=269.46000000000004s)]
*  said to the students, foreign students of Harvard, if you are here you can either transfer [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=273.86s)]
*  or leave the country. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=279.98s)]
*  So let's say this restraining order happens today. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=281.46s)]
*  If you're an international student at Harvard do you say, okay, I'm cool to go in the fall [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=285.06s)]
*  or are you like, hold on a second, am I going to wait every other week to see if a restraining [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=291.58s)]
*  order is in place or if a judge has overturned it? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=296.46s)]
*  Let me play with some students from Harvard who have had to say about this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  It's a mixture of shock then to devastation, frustration, uncertainty, anxiety. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=303.5s)]
*  It's a combination of all of those feelings. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=316.5s)]
*  A lot of the conversations that currently happen in the hallways in between experiments, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=318.3s)]
*  in between classes are where a lot of meaningful progress can get done and if you sort of remove [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=324.38s)]
*  a lot of the people that are having those conversations it becomes a lot harder for [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=334.1s)]
*  ideas to spread. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=338.3s)]
*  So Charles, I was thinking as I was listening to some of those students and some of the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  others who I've heard who have said things like, I don't know what to do. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't know whether I should go back home if I'll be able to come back in, should I [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=349.26s)]
*  apply somewhere else? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=353.34s)]
*  Could individual students fight this legally? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  Yes they can, Chris, and there's precedent for that from what we've seen out of the state [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=358.34s)]
*  of California where there have been a number of different students and individuals who [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=362.18s)]
*  have fought these types of mandates from the government successfully. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=365.94s)]
*  It is a different conversation when you're talking about the information that has been [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=369.5s)]
*  requested by the federal government from Harvard as an institution versus an individual's right [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=373.94s)]
*  to fight and stay where they are. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=378.82s)]
*  And I think that some of those students may find greater success in pursuing that very [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=381.1s)]
*  route as an individual basically seeking redress by the court to try and stave off this notion [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=384.94s)]
*  that they would have to leave. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=390.18s)]
*  Of course the government's argument is going to be, we're not saying you have to leave, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  we're saying you have to leave Harvard so you can potentially transfer if you don't [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=394.54s)]
*  want to go away or back to where you're from. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=398.38s)]
*  But I think that some of these students are going to be able to successfully petition [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=401.74s)]
*  for their right to stay here and stay at the institution of their choosing. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=405.54s)]
*  To his point, that's quite a way to run a university. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=409.58s)]
*  So 27% of the student body is now in question. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=412.34s)]
*  And okay, individually maybe some of these students have good cases. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=416.14s)]
*  Does every student have the ability and means to go out and get a litigator to go to court [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=420.06s)]
*  to make this argument? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=424.38s)]
*  I mean that is like... [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=426.78s)]
*  Can I tell you just one example of where we are? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=428.82s)]
*  The future queen of Belgium is getting her master's degree in public policy there. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=430.94s)]
*  The palace is investigating. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=435.9s)]
*  Yours will not be obviously a financial question, but what does it serve to get her gone? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=437.66s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=446.42s)]
*  So where does that leave everything? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=447.42s)]
*  Look, to the most important thing, Harvard finds themselves in a lose-lose situation. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=449.90000000000003s)]
*  They continue down the path of being opposed to Trump the way that they are. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=456.54s)]
*  They're going to continue to get hit with things like that and forced to fend it off. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=460.22s)]
*  Judges may step in, still creates larger problems for them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=463.66s)]
*  At the same time, they've been widely praised for standing up to Trump. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=466.9s)]
*  They're one of the few institutions that have done so during this administration. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=470.97999999999996s)]
*  And Donald Trump has not shown himself, at least in the eyes of Harvard, to be someone [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=475.41999999999996s)]
*  that you can negotiate with. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=480.34s)]
*  So what do you do? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_LjT9OGsU&t=482.0s)]
