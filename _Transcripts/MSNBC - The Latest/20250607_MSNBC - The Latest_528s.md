# Attorney for Kilmar Abrego Garcia blasts ‘extremely suspicious’ timing of new charges
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo)
*  Last night, protests erupted in downtown Los Angeles after immigration authorities raided [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=0.0s)]
*  three locations across the city on Friday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=5.8s)]
*  Hundreds took to the streets outside an ICE facility to protest the raids and demand the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=9.36s)]
*  release of SEIU California President David Huerta, who was detained while documenting [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=13.76s)]
*  the arrests. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=18.68s)]
*  This follows an update to another major immigration case. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=19.84s)]
*  Kimar Abrego-Garcia, the Maryland father who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=24.0s)]
*  the Trump administration earlier this year, has been returned to the United States. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=28.8s)]
*  But the Justice Department isn't presenting it as a correction for what multiple courts, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=33.84s)]
*  including the Supreme Court, have ruled was an illegal removal. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  Instead, he's back in the country to face human smuggling charges in Tennessee. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=42.36s)]
*  According to the newly unsealed indictment, prosecutors allege that over the last nine [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=47.28s)]
*  years Abrego-Garcia and others conspired to transport undocumented migrants, including [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  alleged MS-13 members, from Central America through Mexico and across the Texas border [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=57.28s)]
*  into the U.S. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=62.52s)]
*  The Trump administration appeared to face no obstacles in returning Abrego-Garcia to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=64.04s)]
*  the United States, despite previously insisting that only El Salvador's President Bukele could [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=69.44s)]
*  authorize his return and that Bukele had refused. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=76.28s)]
*  And yet he's here. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  Yesterday, Abrego-Garcia's attorney called this prosecution a clear abuse of power, saying, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=81.72s)]
*  After months of delay and secrecy, they're bringing him back not to correct their error, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=87.08s)]
*  but to prosecute him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=91.64s)]
*  This shows they were playing games with the court all along. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  Due process means the chance to defend yourself before you're punished, not after. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=96.08s)]
*  Joining us now is another member of the legal team representing Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, Benjamin [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=101.52s)]
*  Ozario, who's an immigration attorney with Murray Ozario PLLC. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=105.6s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=110.88s)]
*  My first question to you is, have you talked to Abrego-Garcia, and what has he told you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=113.4s)]
*  about these charges that are against him? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=119.0s)]
*  Does he say he's innocent? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=121.0s)]
*  First of all, thank you very much for having me. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=122.0s)]
*  So Simon, who you just quoted, will be traveling to see Mr. Abrego-Garcia this weekend. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  So that's going to be the first opportunity we've had to speak with him. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=130.6s)]
*  Regarding the criminal charges, for the time being, he's been appointed a federal public [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  defender. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=139.0s)]
*  And I imagine that that attorney has spoken with him about sort of the nature of his criminal [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=141.0s)]
*  charges, but we have not yet had an opportunity to speak with him, and we hope to accomplish [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=145.24s)]
*  that this weekend. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=148.8s)]
*  Well, Mr. Ozario, just weeks ago, the Trump administration said it was out of their control [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=149.8s)]
*  to return Mr. Abrego-Garcia to the United States, and only El Salvador's president could [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=155.52s)]
*  make that call. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=161.08s)]
*  Now they're saying in a restaurant warrant was all it took. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=162.08s)]
*  What do you make of this timing? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=167.26s)]
*  I mean, the timing is extremely suspicious, and also the nature of the charges themselves. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=169.92s)]
*  If you look at the indictment, there's a number of different allegations, but conduct that's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  not charged. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  They charge him, or they allege that he's a gang member. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  They don't charge him with gang participation, even though it's a gang participation statute. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=180.56s)]
*  They allege that he was trafficking in firearms. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  They don't charge him with that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=186.04s)]
*  So I think this is all an attempt to muddy him up. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=187.56s)]
*  And then on top of that, I think this is an attempt to cover up what they are doing, which [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  is really complying with the court order here and trying to say, no, we're doing this as [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=194.88s)]
*  a result of an extradition. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=199.12s)]
*  But no, you're doing this to cover the fact that you needed to facilitate his return. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Zario, he is facing, I think it said, 10 years per migrant that he allegedly [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=205.84s)]
*  helped to get into the country, which would amount to a life sentence. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=214.44s)]
*  In your experience, is that the normal punishment that someone like Abrego-Garcia would face [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=218.68s)]
*  in these kind of cases? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  So again, I'm an immigration lawyer. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=226.08s)]
*  That's not really my specialty. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=227.88000000000002s)]
*  I will say having reviewed the criminal documents regarding the individual who owned the vehicle, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=228.92s)]
*  who is currently serving time on reentry, he got, I believe, three to five years on [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=234.2s)]
*  all of the conspiracy human trafficking charges that are related, I guess, to the charges [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=239.48s)]
*  that they're trying to bring against Mr. Abrego-Garcia. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=244.27999999999997s)]
*  So you would not typically see that sort of sentence for somebody with zero criminal history. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  A federal prosecutor in the U.S. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=253.0s)]
*  Attorney's Office for the Middle District in Tennessee resigned a few weeks ago as the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=254.84s)]
*  office began its case against Mr. Abrego-Garcia. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  What does this suggest to you about the strength of the government's case against your client? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=265.12s)]
*  Well, it's odd if they believe that it was a very strong case that they didn't bring it in 2022. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=271.88s)]
*  It's also odd that the timing relates exactly to when they were ordered to bring him back. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=277.64s)]
*  So I can understand that the prosecutor who resigned may have felt that this was only being [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=283.56s)]
*  done for political reasons and not really in the interest of justice here. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=288.84s)]
*  Mr. Rosario, the Senator Van Hollen released a statement on Abrego-Garcia. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=294.64s)]
*  Obviously, he went to El Salvador, met with your client, said for months the Trump administration [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=300.24s)]
*  flouted the Supreme Court and our Constitution. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=305.32s)]
*  As I have repeatedly said, this is not about the man, it's about his constitutional rights and the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=307.64s)]
*  rights of all the administration will now have to make its case in the court of law as it should [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=311.56s)]
*  have all along. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=316.04s)]
*  This seemingly is exactly what a lot of people were asking for, which is due process. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=318.04s)]
*  It's happening happening after the fact. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  But this is how it should have worked from the beginning. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=326.36s)]
*  Right. There was an accusation to Mr. Abrego-Garcia. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=329.4s)]
*  He got lawyers. You guys all went in court and hashed it out out there. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=332.68s)]
*  This is but but it's working. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=336.04s)]
*  We're working backwards here quite a bit. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=338.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, the good thing is, you know, we ended up sort of avoiding a constitutional crisis here and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=341.88s)]
*  we are getting due process for him. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=346.96s)]
*  We were never fighting for the character of this man. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=349.08s)]
*  We were only fighting for him to get the process that he deserved and for the rule of law to be enforced [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=351.8s)]
*  here. This is the man who had an order that was supposed to protect him from going to El Salvador. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=357.92s)]
*  And the government admitted it committed an error when it sent him to El Salvador. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=361.72s)]
*  So we were just asking the government to correct that error. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=365.52s)]
*  If they want to charge him with criminal charges, that is well within their right. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  I hope he gets the due process and there's criminal proceedings that he did not get in the immigration [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=370.88s)]
*  proceedings that just occurred to him. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=374.4s)]
*  And, you know, the executor cannot break the law and then say, whoopsie. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=377.2s)]
*  I mean, it's just very offensive to our constitutional order. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=382.88s)]
*  And due process is the big issue in this case. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=387.4s)]
*  Mr. Osorio, let me have you listen to comments that President Trump made about your client yesterday. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=391.88s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=398.2s)]
*  Never. He should have never had to be renewed. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=400.88s)]
*  I could see it either way. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=403.52s)]
*  Bringing it back. We're not bringing it back. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=404.64s)]
*  But by bringing it back, we show how bad he is. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=406.04s)]
*  He's a bad guy. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=408.44s)]
*  Your reaction to those very strong characterizations of your client. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=411.12s)]
*  The one bad guys get due process. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=416.12s)]
*  I mean, that's just the way it is. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=417.8s)]
*  If you or I go out and commit a heinous crime, we get due process. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=418.88s)]
*  If we're alleged to have committed something that we did not do, we get due process. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  Again, it's not the type of crime or the serious nature of the crime that matters. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=426.32s)]
*  Everybody gets due process. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=430.72s)]
*  If you're charged with speeding and you want to contest it, you get due process. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=431.72s)]
*  If you're charged with murder and you want to contest it, you get due process here. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=434.28000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, it's again, it's very unfair for the executive branch who's supposed to [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=437.24s)]
*  facefully enforce our laws to say that we don't have to follow the law. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=442.12s)]
*  Mr. Osorio, before we let you go really quickly, you know, it is not proven that this [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=447.0s)]
*  administration is able to bring people back from El Salvador. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=452.52000000000004s)]
*  Does this do you in your mind? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=456.28000000000003s)]
*  You're an immigration attorney. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=457.48s)]
*  Does this open up the possibility that more folks will have to be brought back now that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  they've proven that they're able to do so? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=463.12s)]
*  Well, I think that's probably one reason they did this under the guise of extradition. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=465.8s)]
*  Right. If you do it under extradition, you say, well, we're not doing it as part of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=468.64s)]
*  bringing this person back because of a court order regarding their immigration proceedings. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=471.72s)]
*  We're doing it back to charge them with a crime. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=475.24s)]
*  And so then they could use that to justify in the future. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=477.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, these people haven't been charged with a crime here in the United States, so we [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  can't bring them back. But I do think it demonstrates. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=481.88s)]
*  And there are other cases that are ongoing right now in federal district courts where [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=484.4s)]
*  they're being ordered to facilitate other individuals return. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=489.24s)]
*  So I do think you will see more of them. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=491.8s)]
*  Judge Boasberg has just said that some of the Venezuelans can contest whether they are [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=493.32s)]
*  alleged gang members. I really hope that happens for in particular, Audrey. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  So I do think that you will start to see a wave of these individuals being able to [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=501.48s)]
*  contest their removal from the United States. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcUKgCCsWmo&t=505.48s)]
