# Norm Eisen: New polls show ‘Trump has lost the first 100 days’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns)
*  Donald Trump is just shy of marking his first 100 days in office, and his administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=0.0s)]
*  is already a retenant of the Constitution and abusing his executive branch power. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=6.68s)]
*  From deporting legal residents and American citizens alike with no due process, to arresting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=12.16s)]
*  judges to make a political point, and defying a court order to secure the release of a man [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=17.7s)]
*  the administration admits it mistakenly deported, Donald Trump is transforming America without [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=23.0s)]
*  the authorization of Congress and the defiance of the courts and without your authorization. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=29.52s)]
*  And signs are showing the public may have had enough. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=36.42s)]
*  A brand new NBC News poll out this hour shows Donald Trump's approval 10 points underwater. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=39.64s)]
*  Joining us now is former special counsel and former special assistant to President Obama, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=46.36s)]
*  Norm Eisen. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  He's also the executive chair of State Democracy Defenders Fund. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  Welcome again, sir. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  So if you were a legitimate populist, you would look at those poll numbers and say, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  well, we've got a reverse course. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  If all you cared about was your base, then you would double down. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=62.92s)]
*  I thought this reporting from Axios was interesting, that the MAGA base is loving things like the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=65.84s)]
*  arrest of the Wisconsin judge that we saw this past week. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  Trump delivered a shock in all series of first 100 day actions and executive orders, but [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=76.84s)]
*  MAGA podcasts and social media posts showed the true believers wanted more. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=81.16s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Cash Patel have urged patients insisting [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=87.4s)]
*  to the base that they're hard at work targeting deep state provocateurs and other enemies [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=92.44000000000001s)]
*  of MAGA. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  Friday's arrest of Judge Hannah Dugan took some pressure. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  This is not how government or democracy is supposed to work, Norm Eisen. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=101.04s)]
*  It's been so interesting for me to be with you all for the first 100 days of Trump, because [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  when we started, when I first came on here and Trump's calling me out, we said, well, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=111.36s)]
*  what's this first chapter going to look like? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=117.52s)]
*  And Alicia, he's losing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=121.12s)]
*  And the arrogance, the overreach, that is a classic trait throughout millennia of history [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=124.2s)]
*  of autocrats and authoritarians. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=130.56s)]
*  And if you look across those issues, court proceedings, that's where we started. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=132.88s)]
*  He's lost almost 100 times in court. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=138.04s)]
*  We've never seen anything like it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=141.08s)]
*  He's losing on these immigration cases. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=142.84s)]
*  That's driving public revulsion against him, the opposite of populism. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=145.96s)]
*  You can't rule with 30% MAGA base. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=151.0s)]
*  The public is up in arms. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  We're seeing in some of these polls, 80% of Americans are saying, hey, Trump, you should [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  be following court orders. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=162.54000000000002s)]
*  So the litigation has struck a spark. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=164.0s)]
*  When you have the polls, both the electoral polls and the public polling, look at that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=166.68s)]
*  landslide loss, the Wisconsin Supreme Court case. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=172.68s)]
*  It was a referendum on Musk. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  By the way, Musk, he's been driven out. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=178.4s)]
*  Where is Musk? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=180.96s)]
*  It's like, where's Waldo? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=181.96s)]
*  He's gone. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=183.52s)]
*  They're hiding him because it's been doged such a failure. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=184.52s)]
*  And finally, it always happens last, the political leaderships, the four Ps. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=187.38s)]
*  They're now following along. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=192.28s)]
*  I was so excited. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=194.0s)]
*  We had two big court wins this week at State Democracy Defenders Fund. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=195.0s)]
*  One of them was Trump's election EO, where he wants to benefit his voters. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=199.2s)]
*  You know, in America, the voters are supposed to pick the president, not vice versa. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=205.92s)]
*  I went to court and Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer had a table full of lawyers in court. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=210.52s)]
*  So they're all in now. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=216.86s)]
*  Trump is, he's lost the first 100 days. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=218.76s)]
*  You said you had two. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=221.08s)]
*  That was one. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=222.24s)]
*  What was the other one? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=223.24s)]
*  There's something near and dear to all of our hearts here in journalism, Voice of America. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=224.28s)]
*  He tried to take down Voice of America. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=229.96s)]
*  We got a preliminary injunction stopping him. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=232.16s)]
*  First Amendment. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  It matters. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  It does. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=238.16s)]
*  It does matter. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=239.28s)]
*  I just, I really, I love the legal piece. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=240.28s)]
*  And that's an important part of all of this in so many ways. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=245.8s)]
*  To me though, the most disturbing part is what happened to Judge Dugan. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=250.32s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=255.36s)]
*  And the fact that you have American citizens applauding it and wanting more and having [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=256.36s)]
*  members of Congress, Republican members of Congress specifically, saying arrest more. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=263.28s)]
*  So how does, how do we then gird ourselves against further erosion in that lane where [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=272.2s)]
*  there's another judge, this time a federal judge, who rules in a way and Trump doesn't [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=279.8s)]
*  like it? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=286.12s)]
*  What recourse do we have to protect them? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=287.12s)]
*  Because you're on the front line on the paper, right? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=291.0s)]
*  The Constitution, the principles, the ideas, the norms that we all try to live by. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=295.2s)]
*  But when you arrest a judge, how do we as citizens respond to that? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  Can I, arrest a judge that has not broken a, judges are not above the law. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=308.12s)]
*  They're not above the law, right. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=315.4s)]
*  They're not above the law, but these judges, there have been judges that have committed [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=317.24s)]
*  crimes that have broken the law. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=321.48s)]
*  It seems the facts that we have on the table that the government has put forward are loose [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=324.12s)]
*  at best. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=331.36s)]
*  They are trying to charge these folks with felonies. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=332.36s)]
*  When we came on at the beginning, when I came on at the beginning of the 100 days, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=337.08s)]
*  my greatest fear for American democracy was that Donald Trump would boil the frog. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=341.28s)]
*  Like as an ex-diplomat, I saw Erdogan did in Turkey, Orban did in Hungary. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  He didn't boil the frog, he microwaved the frog. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=352.56s)]
*  Arresting a judge, the American people, these same American people, 80% of whom said Donald [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=356.12s)]
*  Trump must follow court orders. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  They are not going to tolerate Trump arresting judges. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=363.48s)]
*  And you know who else is not going to tolerate it? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=367.6s)]
*  The rest of the judges. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  That's in a chill down the spine. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=372.68s)]
*  He's already losing at the Supreme Court. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=374.76s)]
*  He thought that was going to be his home turf. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=376.72s)]
*  He's lost case after case after case, five, four, seven, two, nine, nothing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=379.0s)]
*  It's not going to work. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=384.56s)]
*  What you're going to see now is a pushback. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=385.72s)]
*  This case is baloney. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=387.5s)]
*  That judge released, she has control of her courtroom. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=389.44s)]
*  She's entitled not to allow an arrest. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=392.8s)]
*  She sent that man in the hallway where the federal agents were. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=395.16s)]
*  There was no crime there. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=401.56s)]
*  But he is now articulating the fact that he does not fundamentally believe in due process. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=402.56s)]
*  I want you to take a listen to what he said on Air Force One on Friday about the role [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=406.68s)]
*  the judges are playing in blocking his immigration efforts. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=413.36s)]
*  We're having a very hard time with judges because they don't want people to be moved [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=414.36s)]
*  out of the country. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=421.84s)]
*  Shockingly, nobody's ever had this before, no other president. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=422.84s)]
*  It's never been a time when this has ever become an issue, when they talk about due [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=425.84s)]
*  process, when you have millions of people that you're moving out that are really bad [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=428.84s)]
*  people, very dangerous people, and you have a judge that wants every single one of them [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=433.84s)]
*  to have a trial. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=440.84s)]
*  A judge wants- [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=443.55999999999995s)]
*  It's not dangerous. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=444.55999999999995s)]
*  Just for the record, I just wanted that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=445.55999999999995s)]
*  Very dangerous people. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=447.55999999999995s)]
*  Baby! [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=448.55999999999995s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=449.55999999999995s)]
*  Your mother was dangerous. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=450.56s)]
*  Did you see that picture of all the kids in the immigration court where they're going [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=452.72s)]
*  to move these children out of the country? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=458.44s)]
*  Look, Alicia, everything he said in that clip was a lie. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=460.8s)]
*  The reason the judges are doing this is to defend the Constitution. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=466.08s)]
*  You have all this as many Republican-appointed as Democratic-appointed judges who are speaking [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=470.56s)]
*  out against him. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=476.84000000000003s)]
*  He says we've never seen this before. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=478.12s)]
*  We've never had a president come in before and trash the Constitution this way. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=480.58s)]
*  One of the first cases that we filed was the very first in the country, birthright citizenship. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=486.58s)]
*  The Constitution chooses which babies born in this country are citizens and not Donald [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=492.48s)]
*  Trump. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=497.5s)]
*  And from that to now, with his election ZO where we were litigating this week, where [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=498.5s)]
*  he wants to pick which voters get to vote, he's flying in the face of the Constitution [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=503.58s)]
*  and it's not working. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=509.28s)]
*  It's not just the court losses. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=510.88s)]
*  You're seeing the public rising up. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=512.78s)]
*  You're seeing losses at the electoral polls and political leadership rising up. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=514.88s)]
*  He's going to be swamped. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=520.24s)]
*  I'm calling it right here on the weekend. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=521.88s)]
*  He's going to be swamped at the polls in 2026 and he's going to be swamped in the courts [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=524.64s)]
*  because he's pissed off the judges. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=530.0s)]
*  Do you think he sees himself going to 2026? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=531.64s)]
*  I do. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=534.4s)]
*  Do you think he sees himself trying to proceed electorally? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=535.4s)]
*  What we've seen is this autocracy that roughly 30% of Americans that Donald Trump commands, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=540.4s)]
*  they'll follow anything. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=549.24s)]
*  By the way, very interesting, a chunk of them were Obama voters. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  When I worked on the Obama campaign, it's the same people. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=554.9599999999999s)]
*  We need to talk about that. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=558.48s)]
*  We need to talk to those people about real issues. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=559.92s)]
*  Putting that to the side, you can't rule the country on 30%. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=564.4s)]
*  We're seeing his autocracy is like a virus in the body politic. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=568.6s)]
*  It's like a political COVID. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=572.88s)]
*  But the immunities in these four piece court proceedings, polling, public protest and political [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=574.76s)]
*  leadership, the immunities are stronger. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=582.64s)]
*  If he tries not to have those elections in 2026, you will see hundreds of millions of [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=585.4s)]
*  Americans out in the streets. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  By the way, peaceful, lawful, vigorous protests. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=592.56s)]
*  There's more now than we saw when he was elected last time around. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=595.6s)]
*  I think it's a struggle. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=601.16s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=604.28s)]
*  I'm sorry our country has to go through this. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=605.28s)]
*  I really am. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=607.72s)]
*  It's painful. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=608.72s)]
*  It's like a heavyweight championship fight. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=609.72s)]
*  When we were coming up that great, the thrill in Manila, 15 rounds. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=612.76s)]
*  This is 15 periods, 100 days. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=616.76s)]
*  We're coming to the end of round one. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=620.12s)]
*  But I think he lost round one. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=622.76s)]
*  And now we're going to have this marathon to save our democracy. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=625.4s)]
*  I think that's an interesting point when you look at how folks are beginning to walk into [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=629.88s)]
*  framing these 100 days and what they look like. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=635.68s)]
*  You've got American Progress op-ed noting, authoritarian perpetrators erode the rule [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=639.24s)]
*  of law by attacking prosecutors, neutering public watchdogs and shielding themselves [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=646.96s)]
*  and their families and their allies from legal consequences. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=652.64s)]
*  What remains is not a functioning democracy but an unaccountable executive cloaked in [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=656.6s)]
*  here's where you come in, in the trappings of legality. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  So to the bigger point, it is that piece, the legality. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=666.12s)]
*  I'm going to make everything I'm doing legal. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=670.52s)]
*  Everything I am doing is legal. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=673.44s)]
*  I'm going to make you believe everything I'm doing is legal, which is why what you're doing [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=674.76s)]
*  at Democracy Front is so important and what Mark Elias is doing out there is so important. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=679.5600000000001s)]
*  And I wish there were other Republican lawyers that would join if you give a damn about the [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=687.08s)]
*  Constitution because it's that important to push up against this false notion that what [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm doing is legal. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=698.88s)]
*  I will say on the Republican lawyer front, 30, almost three dozen, over 30 Republican [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=700.6s)]
*  dignitaries, legal dignitaries from every administration, Nixon to Trump won, all joined [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=707.96s)]
*  us in that Venezuelan deportation case. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=714.6s)]
*  It's another lie that Donald Trump told on Air Force One. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=718.52s)]
*  Innocent people are getting swept up in these deportations. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=723.0s)]
*  Almost 36 of them joined us. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=727.84s)]
*  All Republicans to say, hey, this is not conservative. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=729.72s)]
*  They said it to the Supreme Court and to the Court of Appeals, the D.C. circuit. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=733.24s)]
*  And those Republicans on those courts, listen to my clients. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=738.72s)]
*  I did that together with Stuart Gerson, Bush administration lawyer. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=742.84s)]
*  We were the co-counsel bipartisan. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=747.1s)]
*  So you're telling me it's some legal Republicans out there. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=748.1s)]
*  They're excellent. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=750.64s)]
*  He's not the only one. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=751.64s)]
*  They're excellent. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=753.2s)]
*  So I don't want to be falsely optimistic with y'all. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=754.8000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, it's a tremendous struggle. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=759.4s)]
*  It's just the first round of that 15-round heavyweight championship. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=761.4s)]
*  But he did not win the first 100 days. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=765.3s)]
*  He lost the first 100 days. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=769.0799999999999s)]
*  That's why you're seeing the lashing out. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=771.12s)]
*  That's why they arrested Judge Dugan, because they don't know what to do. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=773.1999999999999s)]
*  They're desperate. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=777.64s)]
*  They're trapped. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=778.64s)]
*  They're cornered. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=779.64s)]
*  They're making mistakes. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=780.64s)]
*  They're not boiling the frog. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=781.68s)]
*  They're microwaving the frog. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=783.4399999999999s)]
*  If they don't make a course correction, this will not work. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=786.2s)]
*  Democracy will endure. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=790.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, there you go. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHDHcfuuns&t=792.08s)]
