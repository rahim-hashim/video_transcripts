# ‘Trump has simply gone too far’: Trump approval ratings tank to historic 100-day low
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY)
*  This week we will hit the 100 day mark of Donald Trump's presidency [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=0.0s)]
*  If you can't believe how quickly time has flown by that's not at all how I feel [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=5.28s)]
*  But if that's how you feel don't worry everyone there are only [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  1361 days to go of this journey [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=14.24s)]
*  Now the first hundred days though is often the high water mark of a presidency [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  It's it's you're fresh off a political wing you have momentum you can finally try to implement the plans you talked about on the campaign trail [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  You're still in a sort of honeymoon phase of your presidency for most presidents [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=28.2s)]
*  It's a time when the American people are most willing to extend some them definitive the doubt of what you're gonna do [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=33.28s)]
*  But as we approach the end of Trump's first hundred days [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=39.64s)]
*  It seems he was pretty quick to squander whatever goodwill he came in with and that's not just me saying [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=42.6s)]
*  I mean poll after poll after poll and I literally mean there's so many of them is making that all perfectly clear [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=48.8s)]
*  There was a new NBC News poll out just this morning that shows Trump's favorability is at just 45% [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=55.24s)]
*  Now Fox News poll put his approval a point lower at 44% [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=61.56s)]
*  Which by the way is the lowest rating that Fox has ever measured for any president at this point in their term [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=65.44s)]
*  And those weren't even the worst numbers Trump saw this week a Washington Post ABC News poll showed his approval rating at just 39% [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=72.80000000000001s)]
*  Then there are the numbers on the specific issues [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=80.28s)]
*  And this is where I think it gets very interesting like these from the New York Times [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  Trump's underwater by four points on immigration an issue that typically had been his strength [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=86.68s)]
*  He's underwater by eight points on managing the federal government underwater by 11 points on trade by 12 points on the economy by 14 [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  points on foreign conflicts [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=99.44s)]
*  underwater by 21 points on his handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  He's underwater by 21 points on his handling of the case involving Kilmar Obregge Garcia [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=106.48s)]
*  And I think what we're seeing here very clearly is just how badly Donald Trump overplayed his hand [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=111.88s)]
*  or the reason he overplayed his hand is because of his [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=118.6s)]
*  Completely warped view of what the outcome in November meant [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=123.0s)]
*  I mean you might remember in the weeks and months following the election [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=126.63999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump and his allies claimed he had a historic mandate to basically do whatever he wanted [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=129.68s)]
*  America has [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=136.56s)]
*  given us an unprecedented [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=138.24s)]
*  and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=140.52s)]
*  Powerful mandate they're just upset. They're desperate. They're humiliated. They're embarrassed, but Donald Trump has a mandate [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=141.88s)]
*  The president-elect clearly buoyed by his victory telling me in our conversation today that he believes he has a quote [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=148.28s)]
*  Mandate Donald Trump has a mandate. He has the greatest presidential mandate probably since Reagan in 1984 [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=154.68s)]
*  The presidential election of November 5th was a mandate [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=161.84s)]
*  Like has not been seen in many decades [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=166.92s)]
*  Now no matter how many times he or people around him say it [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=171.2s)]
*  He didn't even win a majority of the vote and that is just a fact and yet Donald Trump thought he had a mandate to start [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=174.4s)]
*  a trade war [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=180.4s)]
*  Thought he had a mandate to pick people like Pete Hegseth for his cabinet to oversee the Defense Department [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=182.0s)]
*  He thought he had a mandate to effectively kidnap legal residents and ship them off to foreign prisons [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=187.36s)]
*  But he never did and now in poll after poll after poll [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=193.44s)]
*  The American people are basically telling the president that they are not okay with any of this [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=197.36s)]
*  I mean in that New York Times poll that I mentioned by a wide margin [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=201.44s)]
*  Voters think Trump has simply gone too far [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=205.8s)]
*  66% of voters across the country two-thirds of the electorate described Trump's first term in office this first this hundred days as [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=209.72000000000003s)]
*  chaotic and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=217.56s)]
*  59% described it as scary [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  So too far [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=222.08s)]
*  Chaotic scary not the words you want your first hundred days by the way, but it all sounds kind of right [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  It's not hard to see why the public feels that way either [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=229.4s)]
*  Especially since the country is now facing so many crises of Trump's own making I mean just consider his delusional trade policy [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=233.32000000000002s)]
*  Trump promised that punishing tariffs would force countries like China to negotiate better deals [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  And yet China's basically called his bluff [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=246.44s)]
*  In an interview with Time magazine this week Trump claimed that his administration was in talks with China [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=248.88s)]
*  Even saying that President Xi had called him personally [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=253.68s)]
*  But in a pretty embarrassing twist to be honest China said that actually no [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=256.92s)]
*  Negotiators have not those haven't taken place and no talks are underway [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=261.92s)]
*  They effectively suggested that Trump was [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=266.32s)]
*  misleading the public [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=269.64s)]
*  So it seems pretty clear Trump has gotten the results [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=271.32s)]
*  He hasn't gotten the results he was hoping for and that may explain why he was so vague [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=274.12s)]
*  Late this week when he was pressed for more details on all of it [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=278.8s)]
*  I [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=282.16s)]
*  Let you know the appropriate time let's see we can make a deal I [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=307.36s)]
*  Mean that's all a little awkward to watch, but it's also not a one-off [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=311.56s)]
*  I mean it's the latest in a series of reality checks for this administration when it comes to their on-again off-again tariffs [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=316.36s)]
*  That also includes warnings from senior executives from Target and Walmart and other large American retailers [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=322.76s)]
*  That consumers would see price surges and empty shelves for some imported goods within a few weeks [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=328.56s)]
*  So given the economic uncertainty that Trump is seemingly single-handedly creating [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=334.72s)]
*  It's no surprise most Americans think he has gone too far [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=339.16s)]
*  But the chaos is of course again. It's a feature. It's not a bug. It's not a one-off [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=342.44s)]
*  I mean just consider the dysfunction at the Pentagon thanks to of course Trump's hand-picked Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=346.48s)]
*  We already know Hegseth showed a complete lack of judgment when he shared the plans for a pending military strike on the commercial messaging app signal [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=353.44s)]
*  But now new reporting this week reveals that he created even more security vulnerabilities [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=361.96000000000004s)]
*  The associate press reported that Hegseth had a personal internet connection installed in his office [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=367.36s)]
*  So that he could bypass the Pentagon's security protections to use signal on his personal computer [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=373.08s)]
*  The New York Times also revealed that Hegseth's personal phone number the same one that he used for all those signal chats [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=379.16s)]
*  Was publicly available on the internet. I mean it's pretty clear that this storyline isn't exactly getting any better for Hegseth [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  But it's also about the way he's handled himself since all this news came too late [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=393.64s)]
*  Two officials familiar with the situation tell NBC News Hegseth's behavior has become erratic and he seems increasingly [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=398.04s)]
*  Insecure about his job and standing in the administration leading him to frequently reinforce to staff that he can't allow himself to be fired [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  Based on how he defended himself earlier this week in a visit to his old stomping grounds at Fox and Friends [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  Erratic seems well fairly accurate. I [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=417.92s)]
*  Look at war plans every single day what was shared over signal then and now however you characterize it was [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=420.44s)]
*  informal [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=428.12s)]
*  unclassified [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=429.72s)]
*  Coordinations for media coordination other things when you dismiss people who you believe are leaking classified information and again [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=430.92s)]
*  Why would it surprise anybody Brian if those very same people? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=436.64s)]
*  Keep leaking to the very same reporters whatever information [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=440.16s)]
*  They think they can have to try to sabotage the agenda of the president or the secretary [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=444.08000000000004s)]
*  So once a leaker always a leaker often a leaker [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=449.2s)]
*  Disgruntled former employees are peddling things to try to save their ass. We haven't backed down [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=453.56s)]
*  So here's the thing a lot of people come to Washington and they just play the game [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=458.36s)]
*  and it's you punch their ticket and get along to go along and you know start doing meet the press and and go into the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=462.52s)]
*  Council on foreign relations and spending time with all the new cocktail dripping crowd. That's not why I'm here [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=469.16s)]
*  I'm here because President Trump asked me to bring warfighting back to the Pentagon every single day [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=475.0s)]
*  That is our focus [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  He often thinks when he talks louder that people are gonna listen to him more I've noticed this is a trend [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=484.36s)]
*  But I mean, that's the kind of unhinged and accusatory behavior. That's not just a bad look for the secretary of defense [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=489.16s)]
*  It obviously is it's also a distraction from what the work he should be doing the Pentagon does a lot [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  And it's a disservice of course to the men and women who serves they deserve steady leadership at the Pentagon [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=499.96s)]
*  So given all the disarray at the Department of Defense, is it I mean really any wonder that a majority of Americans view this administration as being [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=505.64s)]
*  Chaotic it seems chaotic. He seemed chaotic in that interview [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=512.2s)]
*  So this administration is in some deep holes right now, obviously across the government [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=516.2s)]
*  When Donald Trump is in a hole his instinct is often to keep digging when it seems like he's pushed too far [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=520.36s)]
*  He will almost always be put we try to push things even farther [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=525.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what we're seeing right now on Donald Trump's signature issue immigration [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=529.5600000000001s)]
*  Sure, lots of Americans voted for this guy. So many did because they thought he would secure the border [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=534.12s)]
*  But what we've seen is something entirely different [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=539.72s)]
*  Instead we've seen his administration mistakenly ship a Maryland man with protected status to El Salvador and then refuse to bring him back [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=543.5600000000001s)]
*  Instead we're hearing Trump muse aloud about shipping Americans back to the United States [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=550.44s)]
*  Muse aloud about shipping American citizens to foreign prisons instead [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=554.04s)]
*  We're seeing headlines about a Trump appointed judge saying a two-year-old American citizen was just supported with no meaningful due process [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=557.16s)]
*  Instead we're seeing headlines about a judge being arrested for allegedly obstructing immigration agents [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=565.3199999999999s)]
*  The bad news is he's trying a lot of scuff that is scary and he is [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=571.88s)]
*  The bad news is there is incompetence and chaos across the federal government. I mean clearly [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=576.04s)]
*  But as we approach the end of this first hundred days [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=581.56s)]
*  The good news is the american people seem to be paying attention to what's happening and they do not seem to like what they see [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=584.12s)]
*  I wonder why [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAWCapwSMY&t=589.4799999999999s)]
