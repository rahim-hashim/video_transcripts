# 4-year-old with cancer among three American kids deported by ICE, lawyers say
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI)
*  I'd say from day one that if you enter this country illegally, it's a crime. If you choose [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=0.0s)]
*  to have a U.S. citizen child, knowing you're in this country illegally, you put yourself [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=5.38s)]
*  in that position. You put your family in that position. What we did is remove children with [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=9.3s)]
*  their mothers who requested their children to depart with them. They weren't deported. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  We don't import U.S. citizens. The parents made that decision, not the United States [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=18.1s)]
*  government. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=21.54s)]
*  This is what he said. The Trump administration put three children, and the children are United [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=22.54s)]
*  States citizens. And that's an important point here. On deportation flights with their [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=27.26s)]
*  mothers late last week, one of them is a four-year-old boy with stage four cancer who was deported [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=30.94s)]
*  without medication or the ability to contact their doctors, the family's lawyer said. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=36.94s)]
*  And while the so-called border czar Tom Homan says their mothers chose to have their children [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  shipped out of the country with them, it's not at all clear that that's exactly what [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=47.24s)]
*  happened. The mothers were given, quote, given virtually no opportunity to speak with lawyers [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=51.1s)]
*  or their family members. Maria Teresa Kumar is the president and CEO of the Latino political [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=57.080000000000005s)]
*  engagement organization Voto Latino. Brendan Buck served as press secretary to Speaker [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=63.14s)]
*  John Boehner, as well as chief communications advisor to Speaker Paul Ryan. And Nira Tandon [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=67.62s)]
*  was formerly a domestic policy advisor to President Biden. She is now the president [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=72.48s)]
*  and CEO of the Center for American Progress, and she was that before as well. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  Nira, let me start with you, because as a domestic policy advisor, people who, for folks [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=81.68s)]
*  at home who don't know, the domestic policy advisor in the White House is the person that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=86.12s)]
*  is very self-explanatory. They shepherd the president's domestic policy agenda so that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  it touches on everything, including from the economy to immigration, right? This border [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=95.72s)]
*  czar situation, using quotes, is a made-up thing. It's not a—it's something that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=102.04s)]
*  the Trump administration created, and I'm unsure about really where Tom Homan sits in [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=107.0s)]
*  the White House hierarchy there, if he's a part of the domestic policy council or not. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  But what is your take on this 9 a.m. press conference this morning talking about immigration? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=117.56s)]
*  The White House had the streets, the winding road up to the White House on the White House [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=125.52s)]
*  grounds lined with photos of people that they say are criminals. I think that this is trying [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=130.68s)]
*  to make their point here, that they are, you know, addressing the lawless and the quote [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=135.4s)]
*  unquote illegal, but again, due process is what makes someone a criminal, and we're [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=141.32s)]
*  not seeing that right now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=145.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think honestly what I took from today was essentially that the president's—President [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  Trump's poll numbers are sinking like a rock, and he—they think that immigration [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=154.48s)]
*  is, you know, their calling card. It is their strongest issue, but it is an issue that is [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  also sinking. You know, the president—President Trump had a kind of huge advantage on immigration [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=166.44s)]
*  after the election, and he has really squandered that. And I think it's actually a really [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  important reminder that, you know, a lot of Democrats said people shouldn't talk about [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=176.88s)]
*  due process rights for people, but due process rights really are what protect individuals, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=181.12s)]
*  are us as citizens, our own liberty against an overreaching state. And when the federal [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  government is taking children who need cancer treatments—let me just say that—an American [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=196.2s)]
*  citizen child who needs a cancer treatment and isn't providing that child's mother [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=203.32s)]
*  any lawyer or any due process and just deporting that parent, I understand that it's important [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=209.76s)]
*  to keep families together. I totally understand that, but the idea that that mother would [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  say, no, I don't want my child to have the cancer treatment, I just find that really [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  hard to believe. And I think that this will kind of lead to a backlash, and I actually [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=228.12s)]
*  am pretty hopeful that even on, you know, on issues like this, the American people can [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=236.6s)]
*  see that, of course, you know, we need strong borders, we need to make changes on the border [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=240.76s)]
*  to ensure that they're secure, but we don't have to become a heartless country where we [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=245.72s)]
*  turn our back on really the most dire medical needs of children. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=252.04s)]
*  You know, Brendan, Neera mentioned some of the polling, and I mean, she's absolutely [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  right. Politico has a story on recent polls showing that Donald Trump is getting negative [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  marks on immigration. A quote notes, a new Washington Post-ABC If-Sells poll released [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  Friday put Trump at 53 percent disapproval among Americans on immigration, with 46 percent [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=271.44s)]
*  approving. The numbers get even worse when you ask about specific things. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=276.8s)]
*  Immigration was a winning issue, frankly, for the Republican Party apparatus, because [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=282.04s)]
*  many people are experiencing in their communities now, from D.C. to Chicago to Denver, everywhere, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=287.04s)]
*  and in between. But the cruelty of what is happening and the lack of due process, I think [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=292.04s)]
*  that the Trump administration is overplaying their hand. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=299.24s)]
*  I mean, the remarkable speed with which they've blown their political advantage is something [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=301.84s)]
*  you, it's hard, it's hard to do this. If I were to map out how to undermine your own [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=306.0s)]
*  advantage, it would be this. Deport American children. Deport someone and admit you made [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=310.32s)]
*  a mistake, but then say you can't get them back. I mean, look, the country was signed [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=316.52s)]
*  up for this. I mean, they said Joe Biden was, and I think rightfully so, too lenient on [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=320.36s)]
*  the border. We need a stronger enforcement mechanism here. And they were ready to support [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=324.48s)]
*  him. And he is so overreached, so fumbled the ball on this so many times that he's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=329.08s)]
*  blown his lead, and eventually people are going to stop trusting him. I think it would [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=333.36s)]
*  help them whenever they make a mistake to say, we can fix this. We'll fix it. We'll [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=337.2s)]
*  bring it back. You can trust us. But the fact that they just stiff arm, any time they screw [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=341.36s)]
*  something up, they say, it's not our problem. It's not our fault. It's this woman's fault. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=345.12s)]
*  I mean, they talked about they were going to prioritize criminals and the most dangerous [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  people here, not the mothers of cancer-stricken children. That just doesn't get a sell. And [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=352.12s)]
*  eventually, I think even Donald Trump's political antenna is going to go off and say, we may [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=356.91999999999996s)]
*  need to dial it back a little bit here. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=361.2s)]
*  It might be too late. I want to play. This is the lawyer for the two-year-old U.S. citizen [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=362.76s)]
*  who was removed from the United States. Yes, a two-year-old has a lawyer. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=367.52s)]
*  ICE has been misrepresenting what's in this letter. The letter, as was just stated, says, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=372.59999999999997s)]
*  my child will come with me. I will bring my child. It's not a statement of desire. It's [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=377.12s)]
*  not a statement of what the mother hoped or wanted to happen. And in fact, what we now [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=380.84s)]
*  know is the mother was told, your child will be deported with you, and was told to write [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=385.52s)]
*  this letter that said, my child will come with me. She was never provided an opportunity [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=390.64s)]
*  to make a different choice. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=395.88s)]
*  We did not. We had audio, no video. But it is harrowing, harrowing. And the four-year-old, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=399.92s)]
*  no cancer treatment, medication, put on the plane, did not have an opportunity, according [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=410.8s)]
*  to the lawyers, the mother in that case did not have an opportunity to speak to the child's [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=416.7s)]
*  father, to make arrangements. This is unconscionable. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=421.34s)]
*  Well, it actually gives you an idea of how quickly they deported her. They didn't give [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=427.3s)]
*  her the opportunity to talk to the child's doctor. They didn't give her an opportunity [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=431.98s)]
*  to pack the child's medication. There's the case of the two-year-old where the father [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=436.62s)]
*  was in court the day before and says, I want to take custody of my child. And the court [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=441.86s)]
*  basically, he filed it, and the court opened the next day. But by the time that the court [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=447.1s)]
*  was reviewing it, the mother and child were already deported. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=451.22s)]
*  So the idea is that cruelty is the point. But one of the reasons that I think that they're [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=455.54s)]
*  doing this is because the economy is tanking, and so they're trying to use immigration policy [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=459.02000000000004s)]
*  as the scapegoat. If UE heard the czar today with the press secretary, the words that they [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=464.82s)]
*  were using against undocumented immigrants was grotesque. And it's because they're trying [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=471.42s)]
*  to make every single undocumented person dehumanized. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=477.46s)]
*  We just came out of a poll for the one of her days of Trump. 66 percent of the voters, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=481.3s)]
*  a thousand voters around the country who voted, mostly, you know, 45 percent of them for him, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=486.58s)]
*  are living under fear, physical fear, because they recognize that the moment that you walk [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=494.34s)]
*  out that door, no one's going to ask you for your papers. Because we're talking about [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=498.56s)]
*  what the government is doing is not only going after brown people that may be undocumented, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=501.76s)]
*  but it also incites those individuals that feel that they're going to be vigilantes [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=507.08s)]
*  and also go after the community. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  I will note the conservative Trump-appointed judge ordered a hearing in the case of one [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=513.0s)]
*  of the three children, saying that the two-year-old appeared to have been put on deportation flight [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=519.8s)]
*  with no meaningful process. The government, this is what the judge says, the government [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=523.72s)]
*  contends that this is all okay, because the mother wishes that the child be deported with [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=527.64s)]
*  her, but the court doesn't know that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg28dL1-1kI&t=531.6s)]
