# Dr. Annie Andrews: 'People in South Carolina are ready for a leader who will fight for them'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI)
*  This is a kid with cancer, one of the diseases the NIH doesn't have the funding to study [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=0.0s)]
*  anymore. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=6.54s)]
*  And this is a kid who's been shot, which despite being the number one cause of death for children [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=7.96s)]
*  in America, is no longer classified as a public health crisis. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=12.98s)]
*  And this kid, and there's really no other way to say this, is quite literally full of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=17.64s)]
*  s***. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=22.76s)]
*  And this is an adult who is also completely and unequivocally full of s***. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=24.200000000000003s)]
*  Dr. Annie Andrews made a hard launch with that now viral campaign ad announcing her [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=31.160000000000004s)]
*  run to challenge South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham in 2026. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=35.92s)]
*  But the road ahead is unlikely to be easy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=40.68000000000001s)]
*  Graham was first elected to the Senate in 2002, and this week the Cook Political Report [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=43.36s)]
*  is marking his seat as safe for Republicans. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=49.56s)]
*  Dr. Annie Andrews joins us now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=53.08s)]
*  Dr. Andrews, thanks so much. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=54.8s)]
*  So as you've just heard, this seat has been held by Republicans for decades. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=56.8s)]
*  What makes you think you can flip it now? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=62.42s)]
*  Well, I'm a mom and a pediatrician, not a career politician. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=67.08s)]
*  Lindsey Graham, as you just said, has been in the Senate for 22 years. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=70.48s)]
*  That's half of my lifetime. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=73.32s)]
*  And over that time period, he's changed his position on nearly every issue. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=74.92s)]
*  I meant what I said in that video, and I will stick to that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=78.8s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans alike are tired of the chaos and corruption that we see from [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=82.44000000000001s)]
*  career politicians like Lindsey Graham. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  Doctor, you have a huge campaign fundraising void that you're going to have to fill to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  be competitive. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  Last time, Jamie Harrison raised around 100 million. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  It was the most expensive election, I believe, in South Carolina. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=102.28s)]
*  And it's not going to be easy to get it done. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  So you're going to have an astronomical amount of fundraising to do. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=108.0s)]
*  But at the same time, Lindsey Graham is vulnerable. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=111.0s)]
*  He is less popular. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=114.0s)]
*  He's less popular than other Republicans. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=116.0s)]
*  What is with his sliding popularity, unpopularity in South Carolina, where he is, his approval [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=119.0s)]
*  rating is at around 34 percent. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=126.0s)]
*  And how do you plan to capitalize on that? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=128.0s)]
*  Yes, Lindsey Graham is as vulnerable as he's ever been because he's as unpopular as he's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=131.12s)]
*  ever been because he's as corrupt as he's ever been. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=136.12s)]
*  He's been in the Senate for 22 years, and in that time, he has failed to deliver in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=140.12s)]
*  any meaningful way for the folks in South Carolina. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=144.12s)]
*  He has enabled every chaotic thing that is coming out of this current Trump administration [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=147.12s)]
*  and is directly harming voters and citizens. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=152.12s)]
*  He has made it so that he can't be the only one to be harmed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=155.12s)]
*  He's willing to take food off of kids plates, gut our nation's Medicaid program and watch [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=158.24s)]
*  prices spiral out of control all so he can deliver tax cuts to billionaires. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=163.24s)]
*  And that's not serving the people of South Carolina. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=167.24s)]
*  I know people are ready for a change. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=169.24s)]
*  That's why our announcement was so successful. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=171.24s)]
*  And if people want to learn more about my campaign, they need to go to Dr. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=174.24s)]
*  Annie Andrews, who is a former president of the United States Department of State. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=177.24s)]
*  She's a former president of the United States Department of State. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=180.24s)]
*  She's a former president of the United States Department of State. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=183.24s)]
*  And if people want to learn more about my campaign, they need to go to Dr. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=186.36s)]
*  Annie Andrews dot com. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=189.36s)]
*  Dr. Andrews, I want to pick up on something that's in your bio on X. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=191.36s)]
*  You say no corporate packs. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=195.36s)]
*  And we've seen some candidates who have had success with fundraising on a grassroots level. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=198.36s)]
*  It's very hard in a state like South Carolina, as Elise was just mentioning. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=203.36s)]
*  But I want to talk about how you run your campaign. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=206.36s)]
*  What are you going to do on the ground that is going to be a grassroots led campaign to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=209.36s)]
*  win small donations when, as we just saw, you had a billionaire who basically took $270 [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  million out of his own pocket to buy an American president and vows to probably do more so [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  of that in the election cycle that you're going to be competing in? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  I will take no corporate pack money and I'll do what I do every day as a pediatrician. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to meet voters where they are. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  As a doctor, I sit down with worried parents and sick children every day. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  I listen to their concerns and I come up with solutions to their problems. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=240.6s)]
*  And that's exactly what I'm going to do out on the campaign trail. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=243.6s)]
*  Being a doctor is not about red or blue and this campaign is not about red or blue. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=246.6s)]
*  It's about meeting people where they are. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=251.6s)]
*  It's about inspiring hope for the folks of South Carolina who are tired of being left behind. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=254.6s)]
*  I believe in South Carolina. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  I believe in the kids and families that I've served there for nearly two decades. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  And I'm not afraid to stand up to career politicians like Lindsey Graham who are willing to sell them out. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  So I'm going to start with Lindsey and I won't stop when I get to the U.S. Senate. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz15xbZ1dpI&t=269.6s)]
