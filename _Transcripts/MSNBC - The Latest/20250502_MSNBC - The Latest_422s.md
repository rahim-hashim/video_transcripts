# 'It’s what they deserve!’: Trump threatens to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw)
*  The existing National Security Advisor Mike Walt was not fired over Signalgate that moving him over to be UN ambassador is essentially a promotion [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=0.0s)]
*  Listen to Vice President Vance speaking yesterday. I [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  Like Mike. I think he's a great guy. He's got the trust of both me and the president [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=12.22s)]
*  But we also thought that he'd make a better UN ambassador if the president wanted to fire him over the signal thing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Which by the way was a total nothing burner of a story. He would have just done it [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=21.46s)]
*  So walls will now have to face a pretty tough confirmation hearing to be UN ambassador [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  Democrats are eager to question him in public the top Intelligence Committee Democrat Mark Warner offering this prediction yesterday [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=31.3s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=40.14s)]
*  Hearing would be like I mean concerning what we know about signal game. I think it would be pretty brutal [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=41.900000000000006s)]
*  Joining me now is Jim Messina former White House deputy chief of staff for President Obama and his former campaign manager [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=48.86s)]
*  Jim welcome you heard him say pretty brutal there. So you've worked at the White House. First of all [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=55.3s)]
*  Do you see this as a promotion for Mike Walt's? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=60.66s)]
*  No, it's not a promotion. Here's a deal in the White House [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  The closer you are to the president the more power you have and when they kick you to New York, you no longer have power [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=67.02s)]
*  And so this they're getting rid of someone they didn't think was up to the job and it's just you know [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=73.82s)]
*  Just as an American you don't want the National Security Advisor gone after the first hundred and two days [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=78.66s)]
*  It shows dysfunction and it's one position that you really need some continuity [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=84.0s)]
*  Because every single day there are threats to America that you need to trust your National Security [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=89.04s)]
*  Advisor and the fact that they had to get rid of him this quick is not a great sign [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=94.12s)]
*  Yeah, although I'm just gonna say, you know, New York isn't a bad place just saying but anyway [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=99.12s)]
*  How should Senate Democrats though approach his confirmation hearing to be UN ambassador? What kind of questions would you want asked? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=105.28s)]
*  Look, I'd want to talk about signal. I want to talk about how you communicate [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=112.72s)]
*  I want to talk in general what the theory of the case is on the tariffs and people might say well [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=115.88s)]
*  What a terrorist has to do with national security, but as you know better than anyone [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=121.88s)]
*  There too are joined here [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=126.48s)]
*  We are confronting real problems and our allies are leaving us at exactly the time we need them most [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=128.24s)]
*  And so I want Democrats to stay focused on these tariffs [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=134.72s)]
*  Which are a tax increase on the American public and really focus on the economy and I would use the hearing to go right at it [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=137.92s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about Marco Rubio. He's got four jobs now [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=145.16s)]
*  He is Secretary of State interim National Security Advisor as well as the acting archivist and then the head of USAID [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  Which was shut down but Rubio may be experienced that seems like a lot for anyone Jim and not since Henry Kissinger in the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  1970s has a Secretary of State also been the National Security Advisor [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=164.72s)]
*  Rubio, I mean he is the second to hold both posts. So what is this telling you? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's telling me that they don't really care about the archivist. I mean, I didn't know that he had that job. That's a little terrifying [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=173.72s)]
*  But what it tells me is that they are unable to figure out exactly how to fill some of these positions internally and just [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  Again from someone who worked in the White House you want separate voices in the room on these really tough decisions [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=187.72s)]
*  Barack Obama once famously said to me I don't pay to tell me when I'm right [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=195.36s)]
*  I pay you to tell me when I'm wrong [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=198.96s)]
*  And so you really want a National Security Advisor who doesn't always agree with the Secretary of State [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=200.72s)]
*  Who has different ideas and different opinions to really make sure you're getting the best? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  The best world of opinions out there and the fact that it's all in one position and someone who by the way [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=211.96s)]
*  Isn't in the White House is sitting down the street [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=217.96s)]
*  I don't think is a great sign for just the way decision-making gets done in the White House [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=220.56s)]
*  Let me ask you about what President Trump is doing today threatening to take away Harvard's tax-exempt status [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=226.2s)]
*  And he says it's quote what they deserve [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=232.04s)]
*  Harvard in response says this is unprecedented [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=234.88s)]
*  And it will hurt student financial aid and undermine critical medical research [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=237.4s)]
*  What Jim is the president's beef with Harvard? I mean did he apply and get rejected or something because it feels so personal [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  No, I was asking one of his senior people about this and they explained this is just great politics for them [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=250.96s)]
*  There's a belief on the right that the American education system is slanted left [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=256.08000000000004s)]
*  It is embodied by Harvard this liberal bastion in their opinion and the more they can wail away on it [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=261.38s)]
*  The better off they are it unites their base unites a whole bunch of people who think that we went too woke [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=268.46s)]
*  In the last few years and harbors an emblem of that. Is it right? No, is it legal? No, is it morally justifiable? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=274.62s)]
*  No, but it's great politics and this is a president who enjoys great politics [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=282.21999999999997s)]
*  So the answer with all those no's do you think that Harvard will indeed have this levied against them I [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=287.02000000000004s)]
*  Think in the end they'll sue and the law is pretty clear that you can't single out [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=293.82s)]
*  Institutions and in the end they'll win the problem is it'll take millions of dollars and a long time [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, they have a lot of their hold themselves in the middle of a political controversy nationwide [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=303.66s)]
*  Which is exactly where they don't want to be but they shouldn't back up. They have to be [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=309.74s)]
*  The kind of bulwark here to say you can't bully American higher education and Harvard's [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=315.38s)]
*  Seemingly willing to be the poster child of that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=321.78s)]
*  Yeah, so far they have done this done [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=325.4s)]
*  So, um, let me ask about the recent NBC News poll which finds Democrats with a 60% [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=327.21999999999997s)]
*  Disapproval rating among voters Jim. What are the party's biggest deficits right now? And what do Democrats need to do better? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=333.21999999999997s)]
*  Look, we have lost the economic argument right now. This is something I feel really strongly about Alex [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=341.34s)]
*  There's some view in our in our side that look you can just let [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=346.61999999999995s)]
*  Trump blow himself up shut up and be quiet and you'll win elections because of it and that may be true [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=350.78s)]
*  We were seeing that in Wisconsin. You're seeing that all over the place, but it doesn't fix the Democrats problem [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=356.29999999999995s)]
*  It doesn't fix over all that we are no longer the trusted economic party [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=361.53999999999996s)]
*  trusted economic party. And when we were, during the Clinton administration, during the Obama [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=365.5s)]
*  administration, in the first Biden campaign, we won elections. So, I think our job is to spend [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=370.62s)]
*  this time as the minority party coming back to the center, working hard to build an economic agenda [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=376.3s)]
*  that makes voters believe us on this. And when we do that, we will win. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=382.94s)]
*  And, by the way, it's not just for middle-of-the-ground independent voters. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=387.34s)]
*  That's what our base wants, too. Everyone wants a firm, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=391.74s)]
*  democratic party who's making people's lives better. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=395.02s)]
*  Jim, we've seen a great conversation as well. Thank you so much. Good to see you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=398.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g_A7SPqlFw&t=421.74s)]
