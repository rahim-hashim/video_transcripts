# ‘It's a me presidency': Rep. Eric Swalwell on Trump’s trip to the Middle East
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4)
*  Let's bring in Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell of California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a member of the House Homeland Security Committee. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=3.04s)]
*  And here with us at the table, David Kord. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=5.32s)]
*  He's the Washington bureau chief for Mother Jones and an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=7.4s)]
*  Congressman, I want to start with Eugene's implicit question there. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=11.28s)]
*  What do you think Donald Trump was giving up or exchanging in these negotiations? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=14.36s)]
*  It's a me, me, me presidency that he's running. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=22.48s)]
*  As I look at this trip and what he's getting out of it, I see how he benefits. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=27.64s)]
*  I don't see how Americans at home are going to benefit. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=33.8s)]
*  Right now, as we speak, Republicans are gutting health care and kicking millions of people [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  off their health care so billionaires can get tax cuts. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=43.72s)]
*  401Ks have become 201Ks. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=46.64s)]
*  The Port of Los Angeles has 35 percent fewer shipping containers coming in right now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=49.92s)]
*  And so on your grocery store and Home Depot and Walmart shelves, you're going to be able [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=57.84s)]
*  to buy less, but you'll have to pay more. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=63.36s)]
*  So more than anything, he gets a lot this week, but we all get screwed. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=66.16s)]
*  I think that's such a poignant point. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  When I'm thinking about the kind of deals that he's made and the folks he met with, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=77.16000000000001s)]
*  the New York Times had some background that they put out today specifically about Ahmed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=80.64s)]
*  al-Sharah. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  He is the former militant leader who now leads Syria. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  It's worth noting that he once led a branch of Al-Qaeda before he broke ties with the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=90.68s)]
*  jihadist group and sought to moderate his image. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=94.04s)]
*  The United States has designated his insurgent group as a terrorist organization. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  Until just five months ago, it offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  to his arrest. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=106.8s)]
*  Now, Congressman, you have Donald Trump praising this man, saying we have to give Syria a chance. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  Is it not? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=114.84s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong, but if Congress has to weigh in here, if Syria or this group [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=115.84s)]
*  is being taken off of, the sanctions are being lifted and being taken off of the terror, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=120.84s)]
*  and this gentleman is being taken off of the terrorist watch list, Donald Trump cannot [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=125.96s)]
*  unilaterally do that, yet he stood today as if he had the power to do so. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=129.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=136.6s)]
*  He has no idea what he's doing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=137.6s)]
*  This is foreign affairs. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=140.16s)]
*  It's not matching on Tinder. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=142.32s)]
*  And he looks at someone and says, oh, they look tough. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  They seem like a fighter, so now they're our friend. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=147.16s)]
*  I mean, that's absurd that that's how he would conduct relations on behalf of the United [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  States, that he would just size someone up so quickly, forgetting past atrocities. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=156.32s)]
*  By the way, as he is over there, having all of this opulence given to him, two-dol Donnie [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=164.08s)]
*  is telling American families that they have to cut back on what they consume. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=173.12s)]
*  And so, again, the American people are not going to be fooled. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=178.0s)]
*  They're not buying this one bit. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=181.36s)]
*  And again, at the end of the day, they want to know what is their president going to do [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=183.68s)]
*  for them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=186.84s)]
*  We know what he gets out of this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=187.84s)]
*  What do the rest of Americans get? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=189.28s)]
*  Two-dol Donnie. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  David, I guess for me, the biggest question that I have for you is that—and I remember [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  a few months ago where presidents really didn't want even the appearance of impropriety, right? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=200.52s)]
*  When you talk to— [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=205.8s)]
*  Oh, you cheated. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=206.8s)]
*  When you talk—but when you talk to even Donald Trump in the first four years, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=207.8s)]
*  There were things that he didn't want to do, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  He's clearly unleashed. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=215.84s)]
*  Talk a little bit about what this looks like. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think if you go back to the first term, I think one of the lessons he got out [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  of that was that he left a lot of money on the table. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=222.88s)]
*  He could have made more. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  He's made $3 billion so far in the first three years of this presidency. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=227.0s)]
*  And when you ask the question, what is he getting out of it? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  What's happening here? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  It always comes back to follow the money. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, he's in a business deal in Qatar with Saudi developers. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=237.48s)]
*  The Saudis gave $2 billion to the fund of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  He's getting a $400 million plane that, if it goes the way it's supposed to go, will [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=246.72s)]
*  end up with his presidential library foundation, which he will have control over. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=250.88s)]
*  They could even sell it and take the money at that point in time. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=255.28s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting that a lot of this money is coming from the Saudis and Qatar. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=258.2s)]
*  It's not just him. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=263.24s)]
*  Pam Bondi was a lobbyist for Qatar, and she said, this deal is fine. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=264.48s)]
*  I've written a memo, but we haven't seen the memo. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=268.72s)]
*  Susan Wiles, his chief of staff, she ran a lobbying firm that had Qatar as a client. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=271.16s)]
*  Steve Witkoff had Qatar buy a $673 million building from him a few years ago. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  Cash Patel had paid as a consultant for Qatar last year, and the FBI and Cash Patel won't [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=283.36s)]
*  tell us how much money he got or what that money was for. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  So we have all this money flowing in from Qatar. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=295.12s)]
*  It's coming into Trump and everybody else, and then they're acting like he's a great [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=298.32s)]
*  statesman. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=302.64s)]
*  And this is really about foreign policy, when it's just about the ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=303.64s)]
*  And Congressman, it's not just about al-Sharah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  It's not just about the Saudi crown prince. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=310.92s)]
*  It's about the fact that you have Donald Trump, the president of the United States, saying [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=313.68s)]
*  that his reference check for al-Sharah was Erdogan out of Turkey, saying, I spoke with [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  President Erdogan. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=322.12s)]
*  He is very friendly with him. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=323.12s)]
*  He feels he's got a shot of doing good. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=324.32s)]
*  You're talking about a leader who has— [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=327.4s)]
*  Alicia, that's like Jeffrey Epstein saying Harvey Weinstein is a great guy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  That doesn't cut it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=337.28s)]
*  Especially when the person you are referencing, to your point, has dismantled the rule of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=340.0s)]
*  law in his home country, has effectively made the parliament in his own country useless, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=345.52s)]
*  checks and balances, has jeopardized a free press. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=353.6s)]
*  It sounds a whole lot like the country we live in and the effort that is underway by [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=357.64000000000004s)]
*  this president to undermine democratic norms. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  Yes, and Erdogan has become essentially an autocratic leader because the four legs that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=369.20000000000005s)]
*  hold up a democracy are gone in that country. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  That's a check by the legislature. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=380.04s)]
*  It's a free press, an independent judiciary and a town square full of people. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=381.96s)]
*  We've lost the first in America, but we have three legs that have held so far. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=386.84s)]
*  The courts, the press and the people showing up. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=390.96s)]
*  We can't lose another one. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=393.4s)]
*  So it has to be a cautionary tale. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=395.12s)]
*  Turkey, they can't be a reference that we're relying upon. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=397.28s)]
*  You know, David, it feels to me that I am not seeing a strong American president on [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=401.12s)]
*  this Middle Eastern trip. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=408.84s)]
*  I go back and I think about when you are crafting a trip for a president or a vice [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=409.96s)]
*  president, particularly their first trip that they choose to take, right? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=415.4s)]
*  President Trump did attend the funeral of Pope Francis, but that was a funeral. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=419.88s)]
*  It wasn't an official state visit, if you will. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=423.44s)]
*  It was a funeral that many world leaders attended. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=425.88s)]
*  But when you're crafting a trip for an American president or vice president, the first trip [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=427.88s)]
*  you take, every single thing is mapped out. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=433.91999999999996s)]
*  It's supposed to send a signal. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=435.84s)]
*  It's supposed to signal strength, relationships. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=437.3s)]
*  Deal making. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=440.38s)]
*  Deal making. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=441.38s)]
*  There's a lot behind it, and it is kind of like your first shot across the bow to the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=442.38s)]
*  rest of the world, but also folks at home, about how you are going to purport yourself [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=447.54s)]
*  on a world stage. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=451.14s)]
*  But I think you're making a mistake. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=452.14s)]
*  Tell me. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=453.14s)]
*  I hate to correct you, but this is not a trip of an American president. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=454.14s)]
*  Okay, David, I was thinking. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=458.78000000000003s)]
*  This is the trip of Donald Trump for Donald Trump. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=461.34000000000003s)]
*  And you go back to what we just talked about a moment ago, the reference of Erdogan. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=464.26s)]
*  The reference also came from MBS, Mohammed bin Salman. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=469.06s)]
*  He said, you got to meet this guy, you got to make nice with this guy. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=471.9s)]
*  Trump is doing what he's doing because he wants to do business with these people. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=475.38s)]
*  And so he's taking their cues. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=480.09999999999997s)]
*  They say he's okay. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=482.2s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of disgusting. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=483.2s)]
*  I mean, we referenced this earlier, that he's meeting with Mohammed bin Salman, who U.S. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=485.18s)]
*  when Trump was president, he was involved in killing, gave the orders to kill Jamal [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=491.38s)]
*  Khashoggi, the Washington Post reporter and an American resident. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=496.26s)]
*  And it's also, just let me forget, it's not a democracy. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=500.42s)]
*  It's an autocratic authoritarian state in Saudi Arabia as well, where dissidents and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=504.46s)]
*  critics are put in jail without decent trials and women are still repressed. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=509.26s)]
*  So he's not dealing with any of that because he's making deals. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=514.5s)]
*  There's a tower going up in Saudi Arabia. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=518.94s)]
*  There's a tower, or a project's supposed to go up in Qatar. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=521.2600000000001s)]
*  That's what he cares about. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=525.1s)]
*  You know, if Al Capone was around right now, he would say, forget crime, I'm going into [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=526.7800000000001s)]
*  politics. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=531.6600000000001s)]
*  This just doesn't seem, I mean, I think you're right. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=532.6600000000001s)]
*  This feels like then, I think more people should be concerned. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=535.9000000000001s)]
*  I do think the American people should be concerned about this because the president is not supporting [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=539.6600000000001s)]
*  himself as the president. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=543.1800000000001s)]
*  He's supporting himself like he's still the chief. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=544.4200000000001s)]
*  CEO of Trump. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=546.5s)]
*  CEO of Trump organization. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=548.06s)]
*  This is a trip for Trump, Inc., not for the United States of America. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=549.86s)]
*  Congressman, in that vein then, how do you make the American people care about this, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=554.3s)]
*  right? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=559.02s)]
*  If we believe that they should be concerned, how do you, members of Congress, folks that [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=560.02s)]
*  are covering the story, how do they make it clear to the American people when eggs are [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=564.66s)]
*  so expensive, when gas is expensive, when they're dealing with, you know, maybe only [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=567.78s)]
*  getting two toys this year instead of 30 because all these people are getting 30 toys every [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=571.38s)]
*  year? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=575.34s)]
*  How do you actually make people understand that this should matter to them? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=576.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=580.34s)]
*  Public sentiment is still working. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=582.5s)]
*  Look, Trump is an aspiring dictator. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=584.22s)]
*  He's not a dictator yet. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=587.0600000000001s)]
*  If this dictatorship was complete, Elon Musk would still be overseeing Doge. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=589.5s)]
*  But people talked and walked with their wallets when it came to Tesla and Musk is out. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=594.9s)]
*  Trump caved on the terrace. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=601.5400000000001s)]
*  And here's a prediction I'm going to make. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=604.26s)]
*  He is going to cave on this plane because the public sentiment is so outraged at it [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=606.06s)]
*  that he's not going to do it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=612.38s)]
*  So as long as the public remains engaged and outraged and they show up, he will continue [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=613.6199999999999s)]
*  to cave. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=618.3s)]
*  But, Congressman, how do you make them care? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=619.3s)]
*  Because I think, you know, you and the other members of Congress who care about the emoluments [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=621.9399999999999s)]
*  clause and understand what it means, how do you get out there? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=626.02s)]
*  What do you tell them? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=629.66s)]
*  What is your argument to the American people? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=630.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=632.66s)]
*  So we have to fight on the inside in Congress. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=633.6999999999999s)]
*  And frankly, times like this reveal in Congress and in leadership who should lead and who [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=637.3s)]
*  should leave. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=643.78s)]
*  And so Jamie Raskin, by the way, he has right now a resolution that he's putting before [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=644.78s)]
*  the floor for a vote that would bring this gift to the Congress for a vote. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=649.5799999999999s)]
*  So we have to show as much fight on the inside. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=654.5799999999999s)]
*  On the outside, I'm going to Republican districts every month and holding town halls. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=657.1s)]
*  I was in Kevin Kiley's district just two weeks ago in Folsom, California. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=661.34s)]
*  We had about a thousand people show up there. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=665.3s)]
*  My colleagues like Jasmine Crockett and Maxwell Frost and others, they're doing the same. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=667.86s)]
*  So if we show fight on the inside, the public will show fight on the outside. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=671.9399999999999s)]
*  And that fourth leg that I mentioned to you, the public outrage and going to the town square, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=676.74s)]
*  that can be enough to get us to the midterms to get a true check on the president with [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=682.42s)]
*  the Congress that will stand up to him. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLu51NJUb4&t=686.18s)]
