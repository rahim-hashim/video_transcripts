# Stunning reporting on Stephen Miller’s role in ordering ICE agents to ramp up arrests and raids
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24)
*  It was a story that I saw, I was alerted, I stopped and read it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=0.0s)]
*  It's an incredible body of reporting. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Take me through it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=8.4s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=9.8s)]
*  Yes, we really looked at what has changed with ICE enforcement leading up to this and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=12.88s)]
*  the marching orders that they're getting from the White House. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=21.48s)]
*  Stephen Miller, as you mentioned earlier, had this meeting in late May where he told [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=25.76s)]
*  agents from around the country that not enough people were being deported and that their [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  focus should not be on criminals and on the target list that they've traditionally used, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  but on just going out and finding anyone who's in the country illegally and deporting them. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=42.36s)]
*  He said, why don't you try Home Depot and why don't you try 7-Eleven? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=48.24s)]
*  And lo and behold, here just weeks later, we saw the targeting of Home Depots in LA. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=52.24s)]
*  Elizabeth, what is the... [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=59.92s)]
*  Is there anyone in the room, I guess, that would point out the lack of precedent or the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=64.72s)]
*  lack of appropriateness for Stephen Miller to be directing law enforcement activity from [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=73.92s)]
*  the West Wing? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=79.16s)]
*  I can't really speak to the appropriateness of it, but we lay out in the story a number [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=83.24s)]
*  of things that have changed operationally at ICE for different reasons. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=91.0s)]
*  Some directives from above and some things that have just changed sort of on a grassroots [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=97.28s)]
*  level on the ground. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=102.88s)]
*  And that includes agents no longer needing to stick to their targets, being able to arrest [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=105.08s)]
*  anyone they encounter, being able to arrest people in sensitive locations like courtrooms, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=111.2s)]
*  schools, hospitals. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  We're seeing them frequently do masked arrests now and really using these splashy shows of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  force. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=128.72s)]
*  Elizabeth, let me read from that part of the reporting. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=129.72s)]
*  You write, federal agents make warrantless arrests. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  Masked agents take people into custody without identifying themselves. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  Plainclothes agents in at least a dozen cities have arrested migrants who showed up to their [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=141.04s)]
*  court hearings. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=145.4s)]
*  Across the U.S., people suspected of being in the country illegally are disappearing [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  into the federal detention system without notice to families or lawyers, according to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=151.28s)]
*  attorneys, witnesses, and officials. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  In Coral Springs, Florida, at least eight agents in tactical gear, shields and rifles, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  surrounded a home with guns raised to arrest a father with no criminal history. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=163.0s)]
*  In Irvine, California, ICE agents drove a phalanx of military vehicles in the Orange County [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=168.08s)]
*  suburbs to arrest a person, though not for illegal immigration. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  They were seeking a resident's son, who had allegedly posted flyers alerting neighbors [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  to the presence of ICE agents. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  How widespread and how lacking in facts and evidence before all these kinds of aggressive [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=189.16s)]
*  tactics take place is the current operation? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=199.68s)]
*  You know, we're seeing these examples pop up all over the country. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=205.72s)]
*  We're seeing them pop up in a lot of different contexts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=208.96s)]
*  And in many cases, the Trump administration and ICE officials themselves are not hiding what [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=214.0s)]
*  they're doing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=220.32s)]
*  They're proud of it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=221.32s)]
*  They're posting on social media videos of them smashing car windows and surrounding people [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=222.32s)]
*  with guns and the like. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=231.12s)]
*  And there's a reason for that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=233.32s)]
*  It's a strategy to convince people to leave the country, to convince people not to come [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=235.44s)]
*  here in the first place. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=241.52s)]
*  And they are leaning on these splashy shows of force. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=243.24s)]
*  So I don't think we've seen the end of them. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpKYLIy_d24&t=247.4s)]
