*  Now actor and comedian Ed Helms is out with a new book showcasing the humor side of our [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=41.0s)]
*  history. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=46.0s)]

*  Helms dives into some of America's greatest, his biggest greatest historical blunders from [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=51.0s)]
*  the 1950s to the 2000s, including training cats, SCIA spies, and planning nukes on the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=57.0s)]
*  moon. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=65.0s)]
*  The Office, Snap Food actor, comedian, and podcast host Ed Helms joins us now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=66.0s)]
*  Ed, hello, thank you for joining us. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=70.0s)]
*  Hey, good morning. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=72.0s)]
*  Congrats on your show. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=73.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=74.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=75.0s)]
*  Now typically people go from, you know, the book to the podcast. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=76.0s)]
*  You're going the opposite way. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=80.0s)]
*  Talk to us a little bit about why you wanted to take the great podcast that you created [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=82.0s)]
*  and turn it into something that us nerds could have in our hands and read and smell and touch. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=85.0s)]
*  Great question. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=90.0s)]
*  So the podcast was just a manifestation of my kind of nerdy love of history and of course comedy [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=92.0s)]
*  mashing those things up. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=100.0s)]
*  And every season, there's three seasons of the Snap Food podcast. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=102.0s)]
*  Every season is a deep dive into one crazy historical Snap Food. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=106.0s)]
*  But in doing all the research, we just found there are so many of these things. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=111.0s)]
*  And it just felt like we got to crank out a book because there's too much. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=117.0s)]
*  And the book is more of a survey. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=125.0s)]
*  There are 30, 31 distinct Snap Foods. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=127.0s)]
*  Each chapter is kind of a new, it's like a short story book. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=130.0s)]
*  And yeah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=133.0s)]
*  And I have to know about these spy cats. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=136.0s)]
*  So he's tickled by them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=140.0s)]
*  So I want to read Operation Acoustic Kitty. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=143.0s)]
*  If Operation Acoustic Kitty was a success, the United States could deploy a team of cyborg [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=147.0s)]
*  kitties to listen in on conversations anywhere in the world and no one would ever be the wiser. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=151.0s)]
*  When it came time to send the cat into the wild, its movements proved so inconsistent that the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=158.0s)]
*  operational utility became questionable. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=163.0s)]
*  The CIA learned just how hard it is to herd cats. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=166.0s)]
*  My Instagram feed is filled with cat videos. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=171.0s)]
*  That's why. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=174.0s)]
*  This was for real. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=176.0s)]
*  This was real. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=178.0s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=179.0s)]
*  It's the Cold War. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=180.0s)]
*  Obviously, the CIA is looking for every opportunity they can to spy on people. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=181.0s)]
*  They thought cats are very furtive. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=185.0s)]
*  They're great listeners. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=187.0s)]
*  And why don't we surgically implant microphones into their ears and then train them to go sit next [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=189.0s)]
*  to bad guys and we'll be able to hear all the things that all the bad things are planning. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=195.0s)]
*  Of course, you can't train cats like everybody. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=202.0s)]
*  Everybody knows this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=207.0s)]
*  Before I ask you a more serious question, can you also expand on the sex espionage? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=210.0s)]
*  How do you do it? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=218.0s)]
*  Is this a family show? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=221.0s)]
*  It's a morning show. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=224.0s)]
*  I don't know about the family show. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=226.0s)]
*  That's a fun one. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=228.0s)]
*  Again, it's the Cold War. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=231.0s)]
*  The Cold War did not bring out the best of us. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=234.0s)]
*  One of the macro lessons here. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=236.0s)]
*  But there was a couple that were spies. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=239.0s)]
*  They were a Czech couple originally, but they were spying for the KGB in the United States [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=245.0s)]
*  and would throw sex parties in Washington, D.C. and New York City to effectively loosen people up. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=251.0s)]
*  And that's how they got their intel. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=259.0s)]
*  And it's a much more complex and interwoven story, but that's the gist of it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=262.0s)]
*  Keep it there. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=267.0s)]
*  Yeah, this might have been the parties Madison Cawthorn was referring to. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=268.0s)]
*  Anyways, let's get to this current moment. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=271.0s)]
*  I know I'm not going to put you on the spot about your political opinions, but having watched the first 100 days, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=276.0s)]
*  can you characterize where this moment in general and where it would go in the book? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=282.0s)]
*  And if you had to include any one scene in your book of what we've seen so far, what would that scene be? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=289.0s)]
*  Wow. Well, the book has the benefit of that great old saying, tragedy plus time equals comedy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=295.0s)]
*  We don't have time. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=302.0s)]
*  We don't have distance from everything that's going on right now. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=304.0s)]
*  But I can tell you that a lot of what's going on right now could probably make, yeah, might be in a future edition of NAFU. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=307.0s)]
*  You know, particularly Doge comes to mind. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=317.0s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=322.0s)]
*  One of the other lessons in studying these snafus and seeing so many of these things play out as you see time after time throughout history, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=323.0s)]
*  people responsible for some of the most terrible accidents or terrible judgment throughout history often suffered zero consequences. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=332.0s)]
*  There's no accountability. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=344.0s)]
*  And that's something obviously we're seeing right now with with Waltz getting this UN ambassadorship nomination. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=345.0s)]
*  It's it's just time and again, people making lateral moves, getting shifted around. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=354.0s)]
*  No one's accountable. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=358.0s)]
*  And what Waltz did, I mean, it's no matter what your political stripes, it's hard to say he didn't mess up pretty bad and should should be accountable. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=360.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is until someone is eventually laid off instead of laterally moved and then writes a tell all. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=373.0s)]
*  But Ed Helms, thank you so much for sharing this very exciting book with us. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=381.0s)]
*  And I do recommend listening to the podcast. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=387.0s)]
*  It's also excellent. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=390.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_W6mTopB4&t=402.0s)]
