# ‘Death by a thousand cuts approach’: Nicolle Wallace on the impact of Donald Trump’s tariff whiplash
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI)
*  Now if you've ever dropped a glass on the kitchen floor and watched it shatter, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=0.0s)]
*  you're familiar with just how far and wide those teeny shards of glass can travel. Small and unseen [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  sharp pieces can hide for months until they're vacuumed up or swept up or, heaven forbid, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=10.88s)]
*  stepped on. This afternoon we are all surrounded by the jagged pieces of our own economy, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=16.48s)]
*  shattered by the uncertainty of on-again-off-again-on-again-off-again tariffs [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=23.68s)]
*  and an as-yet unexplained trade war. On that front this weekend, Donald Trump blinked once again, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=27.68s)]
*  backing off a threat he made days ago, delaying the implementation of a 50 percent tariff on the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=33.04s)]
*  European Union. The European Union is America's second largest trading partner behind China. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=38.96s)]
*  Trump delayed those tariffs by more than one month. The stock market jumped at that news today, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=44.8s)]
*  but in so doing proved again just how much Wall Street and the individual savings and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=50.8s)]
*  retirement values of all Americans are at the mercy of Donald Trump's daily changing whims. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=56.88s)]
*  That chaos and confusion comes at a price not just for investors or business owners, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=64.0s)]
*  but for factory workers, for truck drivers, for restaurant owners, for the common normal people [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=69.76s)]
*  who make our world go round. This from the Wall Street Journal today, quote, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Ruben Diaz typically hauls two container loads of goods a day. In a rented big rig between [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=79.12s)]
*  Southern California's sprawling ports and warehouses dozens of miles away. Now the 38-year-old [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=84.56s)]
*  is struggling to find two loads a week and is being paid less for them, following a sharp drop [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=91.28s)]
*  in imports into the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Late one afternoon, he refueled at [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  the Sunshine Truck Stop after dropping off a single empty container at the port. He figured [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=102.4s)]
*  he would be left with about $50 after deducting costs for truck rental, insurance, and diesel, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=108.16s)]
*  and was considering giving up as a self-employed driver. Quote, I am just surviving, but I am not [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=114.56s)]
*  going to make it, he said. Now that's just one person suffering the consequences, one of those [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=120.16s)]
*  shards of dropped shattered glass. New York Times Today reports on another, the saga of a small [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=126.8s)]
*  business in Vermont that sells stainless steel water bottles with a patented nozzle. After five [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=132.24s)]
*  years, the company Bivo is close to becoming profitable, but then, quote, the drop in tariffs [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=138.4s)]
*  this month to 30% from 145% on most Chinese goods was a relief, but in the way that a flood is better [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  than a tsunami. The duties on Bivo's bottles are higher than 30% because of the material they're [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=153.52s)]
*  made from and how they're classified by trade officials. Bivo bottles that are not insulated [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=159.6s)]
*  are subject to tariffs that add up to 47%, and the rate for insulated bottles is 37%. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=165.76s)]
*  Trump has frequently said that foreign businesses that ship products to the U.S. pay the tariffs, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  but in reality, importers like Bivo pay the duties to the federal government when goods arrive at [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=179.12s)]
*  the U.S. port. Donald Trump's death by a thousand cuts approach to the U.S. economy is where we [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=185.04s)]
*  start today with some of our favorite experts and friends. Professor of economics and public [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=190.72s)]
*  policy at the University of Michigan, Justin Wolfers is back. Also back, David Frum, staff [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=195.68s)]
*  writer for The Atlantic and host of the video podcast, The David Frum Show. Also joining us, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=201.28s)]
*  NBC News political analyst, president of Brilliant Corners Research, Democratic strategist Cornell [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=206.56s)]
*  Belcher is here. Justin, I'm going to start with you because I think you were here for the news [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=212.24s)]
*  that Trump was raising tariffs on the EU. He blinked, which in the long arc of history, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=216.48s)]
*  I suppose, is a good thing, but it's the instability that has now rippled down [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=223.76s)]
*  to affecting truck drivers and U.S. small business owners and manufacturers. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=228.88s)]
*  Where do those impacts, where do those stories of struggle turn? Are they sort of the sign of the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  bottom or do those consequences continue to sprawl? Yeah, this was a tariff policy from Trump that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=243.04s)]
*  nearly lasted one entire long weekend. He was a little unlucky. There was a Memorial Day, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  extended the weekend to three days and you couldn't have a tariff policy last a full weekend. So [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=258.32s)]
*  Friday's policy was by Monday and so we get to analyze it today on Tuesday. And I think [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=264.08s)]
*  that's really symptomatic. There's the individual stories of people who are thinking about equipment [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=270.24s)]
*  that won't come in and it's very easy to track through how that will affect their lives over the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=276.08s)]
*  next two, three, four, five months. Those truck drivers who won't have goods to truck across the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=280.16s)]
*  country, they also won't be stopping at gas stations to buy a sandwich and then the sandwich [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=286.08s)]
*  demand falls off and on and on it goes. But I think it's actually the effects are far deeper than that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=292.16s)]
*  There's an asset here that really matters called American credibility. There was a time when the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=297.6s)]
*  president opened his mouth when you had to pay attention because you thought it meant something, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=303.12s)]
*  that it was a shift in policy that other countries could rely on and respond to. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  That's no longer the case. In fact, on Wall Street right now, it's one level funny and another level [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=312.64000000000004s)]
*  tragic. There's a trade called the taco trade. T-A-C-O, Trump always chickens out. And the problem, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=318.56s)]
*  of course, is that what we're really not seeing is the businesses that aren't being started. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=325.44s)]
*  So somewhere there's an MBA student who just finished school who's thinking about starting [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=331.2s)]
*  some sort of import export business. There's a factory that could be built except for one of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=335.6s)]
*  the most important imports we get from the European Union is precision machinery. And that either just [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=340.56s)]
*  went up 50% or went up 10% but no one can be sure. And so those are the stores and the businesses and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=345.36s)]
*  the factories we'll never see. You mentioned sandwiches. I've got sandwiches for you, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=352.32s)]
*  Justin. This is also from the Wall Street Journal. Vincent Pasinisi, whose Long Beach-based company, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=358.64s)]
*  Santa Fe Importers, supplies Italian meats and cheeses to more than a thousand local stores [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=365.28s)]
*  and restaurants. He said revenue is down 15 to 20% as logistics workers and related companies in [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=369.92s)]
*  the region pull back on spending because of tariffs. Pasinisi said Trump's threat of 50% [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=375.44s)]
*  tariffs on the EU, quote, would destroy that part of my business. No one is going to buy [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=380.56s)]
*  Italian cookies or breadsticks or sauces at a premium that high when there are other alternatives. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=385.44s)]
*  Because of the slowdown, he has reduced the hours of his roughly 50 manufacturing workers by 20%. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=390.8s)]
*  He's also started sending staff who work at Santa Fe Importers' deli counter home early [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=396.72s)]
*  because of the drop-off in dock workers, truck drivers, and port tradespeople picking up [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=401.68s)]
*  sandwiches and pasta dishes to go. Justin, I think you and Steve Leesman both warned in the early days [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=406.32s)]
*  of so-called Liberation Day that the stock market fluctuations, which felt like a big breaking news [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=412.88s)]
*  story, was really like the tip of the iceberg that everything happening under would take longer. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=421.44s)]
*  And I wonder how we'll be able to sort of track the implications for every sort of business that [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  stops carrying a product, that stops having workers that work specifically with that product if it's [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  at a counter, that maybe stop going to their restaurant. I mean, how do you sort of track [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  and cover the trickle-down damage from the tariffs? There is a peculiar political genius [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=450.08s)]
*  to having a policy that lasts exactly three days. The genius, of course, is it's impossible for a [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=457.76s)]
*  nerd like me to find three days worth of data to crunch and tell you exactly what the tariffs are. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=463.28s)]
*  You know, realize a 50% embargo on Europe, which is what the president promised, is effectively, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=470.71999999999997s)]
*  sorry, a 50% tariff is effectively an embargo that's saying your ships aren't welcome here, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=477.44s)]
*  because stuff from Europe is already expensive. Mark it up 50%, it's unaffordable. So in a matter [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=481.52s)]
*  of three days, we've gone from saying no ships from Europe are allowed to yes, just keep on coming. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=486.8s)]
*  And by the way, you know all of this occurred in the middle of a 90-day pause. We're in the middle [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=492.48s)]
*  of a 90-day pause and all of a sudden the president had his Ross and Rachel moment and says, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=498.4s)]
*  no, no, you haven't come to a deal yet, despite the fact we're not going to come to a deal for 90 [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=503.84s)]
*  days. So I don't know how the Europeans work on this, but more to the point, it is really [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=507.52s)]
*  important that people understand that trade with Europe is not olive oil and wine. Well, it is [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=513.52s)]
*  those things and they're delicious, but it's chemicals, it's pharmaceuticals, it's machinery, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=517.76s)]
*  and on and on it goes. And so therefore the effects of this are going to filter out through [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=522.48s)]
*  every other sector of the economy. Now, how do you find the effect of a three-day policy? You don't, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=527.6s)]
*  but I will tell you right now, I'm terrified that the tariff goes right back on. And so therefore [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=532.96s)]
*  it's going to be hard for me to during business relationship or even to purchase orders that [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=537.6s)]
*  would take months to fulfill with my friends in Europe. David, from in the chaos and in the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=542.48s)]
*  erratic policy announcements is that bigger story that I think you constantly play a role of being [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=550.88s)]
*  sort of a North star and in keeping the rest of us in the media focused on that the chaos and the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=558.32s)]
*  indifference and it's almost a sadistic indifference to the plight of the truck driver [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=564.1600000000001s)]
*  is the point. And I wonder how you take in all of the economic consequences for the tariff [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=570.6400000000001s)]
*  erratic, you know, on again, off again. Yeah. Well, the Trump delights in tariffs because they're the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=577.6s)]
*  one form of tax that the president can lay at will at whim or alleviate at will and whim. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=584.56s)]
*  All the other taxes in the are provided by the constitution. Congress must lay. If you want to [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=592.0s)]
*  raise the corporate income tax or give a particular corporation a break, that's Congress's job, not [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  the president. But here he has found something where he can exercise power and he enjoys that [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=601.8399999999999s)]
*  so much. So although it's embarrassing that he takes the tariff puts the tariff off and then, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=606.64s)]
*  as Justin said, immediately removes it, it's also thrilling to him because it's power. It's the surge [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=611.12s)]
*  of power. So I think we need to see the tariff story in conjunction with all the other abuses [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=615.52s)]
*  of power that are going on, the pardons that are being more or less flagrantly sold or applied to [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=620.48s)]
*  people who commit one kind of crime if they like the president and much people with much better [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=626.96s)]
*  stories. But if they don't like the president, they don't get it or prosecuting this candidate [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=632.32s)]
*  for mayor in New York because you don't like him and pardoning that candidate for mayor of New York [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=637.04s)]
*  because you do like him. I think he lives to exercise power capriciously and the more unjust [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__iCLm69puI&t=641.36s)]
