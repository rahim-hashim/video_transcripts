# 'Big, bad bill that benefits billionaires': Rep. Clark slams Trump budget plan passing
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM)
*  For more now, we are joined by House Minority Whip, Democratic Congresswoman Katherine Clark [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=0.0s)]
*  of Massachusetts. Congresswoman, thanks for being with us. You recently shared a New York [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Times article titled, GOP tax bill may hurt the lowest earners and help the richest. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Why are you worried about this bill? Oh, thank you, Anna, for having me. And I can tell you that I [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=14.88s)]
*  am worried about this bill because this is an incredibly huge wealth transfer from working [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=21.2s)]
*  families to the very wealthiest Americans, the billionaire class. And this is a big, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=27.2s)]
*  bad bill that benefits billionaires. That's what it is. And we are seeing them work so hard [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=33.68s)]
*  to fund these tax cuts while running up our deficit at the expense of health care for almost [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=40.72s)]
*  14 million Americans, taking away food programs, either outright or reducing benefits for another [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=48.4s)]
*  million Americans. And for what? Just to pay for these tax cuts. It is an outrage. And we are [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=57.68s)]
*  hearing from every corner of this country, from the American people, that this is a very bad deal [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=65.76s)]
*  for them. And it is one that Democrats are going to oppose with everything we have. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=73.36s)]
*  House Republicans are far from a united front on this bill. After last night's vote, the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=78.72s)]
*  conservative House Freedom Caucus posted that it does not yet meet the moment, pointing to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=83.2s)]
*  increased deficits. I just wonder, are these divides within the Republican Party an opportunity [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=88.0s)]
*  for Democrats to get some concessions? Well, you know, we are way past the concession [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  phase here because this is a completely partisan bill. They have rejected opportunities. They [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=101.44s)]
*  wouldn't even tell us last night about what the proposed changes and side deals they were making. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=108.48s)]
*  And now, for the next step in this process, they have set the hearing for Rules Committee [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=115.36s)]
*  at 1 a.m. 1 a.m. If you have a bill that you are proud of, a bill that is helping meet the high [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=121.36s)]
*  costs of living for American people, a bill that could expand health care, that takes care of our [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=129.28s)]
*  veterans and our seniors and our children, you do not hold the hearing at 1 a.m. So we're going to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=136.88s)]
*  be there at 1 a.m. We'll be there whenever they want to come talk about this. We will continue [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  to offer ideas on how we could actually have fair taxes in this country where everyone pays their [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=149.2s)]
*  fair share and be able to continue to expand health care for people and make sure that we are feeding [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=157.76s)]
*  those who are hungry in this great country, the wealthiest country on earth, and to make these [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=166.16s)]
*  kinds of decisions to make the winner circle so small at the expense of working families and kids [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=172.16s)]
*  and seniors and veterans. That is something that they may be divided about how to go about these [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=178.64s)]
*  cuts. We are unified in our opposition. But what about the debt? On Friday, Moody's credit ratings [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=184.64s)]
*  firm downgraded the U.S. credit rating a notch, joining other major agencies, no longer giving [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=191.52s)]
*  the U.S. their best rating. Moody's pointed to the government's rising debt levels, and according to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=197.44s)]
*  the U.S. Treasury Department, the total national debt increased by about $7 trillion over the past [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=202.72s)]
*  four years. Does that concern you? It sure does. And you know what we are seeing with this bill [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=207.68s)]
*  is another huge debt increase. They are proposing to put $5 trillion on the credit card in addition [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=215.2s)]
*  to all of these cuts they are making to the American people. In pursuit of what? Again, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=225.11999999999998s)]
*  in pursuit of tax cuts for the not only top 1% but the 0.1% who will benefit the most. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  So let's get back to having policy where we have an economy that works for everyone, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  where everyone has an opportunity to meet with success, to build wealth. That is how we get rid [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=246.16s)]
*  of the deficit and are able to cut it. Democratic Whip, Congresswoman Catherine Clark, thanks very [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  much for joining us. Appreciate your time. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=260.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32zCWdf3oaM&t=269.6s)]
