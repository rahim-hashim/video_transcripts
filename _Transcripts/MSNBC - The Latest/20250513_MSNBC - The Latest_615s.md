# Trump should be 'wary' of accepting jet from country that funded Hamas: Ex-Natl. Security official
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw)
*  NBC News senior White House correspondent Kelly O'Donnell is in Riyadh. We're also joined by [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=0.0s)]
*  Washington Post foreign affairs columnist and MSNBC contributor David Ignatius and former director [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=4.64s)]
*  for Syria and Lebanon at the White House National Security Council, Hagar Shamali. So Kelly, what [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=10.56s)]
*  kind of deals is the president looking to make on this trip and do we have any details on the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=16.4s)]
*  agreements he apparently just signed? He did just do the signing ceremony and it had all of the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=21.12s)]
*  elaborate trimmings to that and we've learned through the White House that they have just [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=28.24s)]
*  released a list of some of the areas. A lot of this deals with the defense industry, American [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=33.76s)]
*  business, technology and so forth. They estimate in this first tranche that they talk about $600 [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  million in business arrangements between the Saudi kingdom and the United States and private [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=45.04s)]
*  corporations here including the purchase of $140 billion in defense equipment that of course the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=52.24s)]
*  president talked extensively about how the American military supply chain of all the kinds of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=60.56s)]
*  aircraft and weaponry that we have is the best in the world as he likes to say and the Saudis are [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=66.64s)]
*  frequently a customer and they are again in this deal. The president talked about the importance [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=73.92s)]
*  of the economic relationships and we saw a lot of mixing and mingling between officials from both [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=79.04s)]
*  countries and business leaders. The president talked about what he sees on the line here [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=84.48s)]
*  in at least this part of his first overseas trip of an extended nature in this second term. Here's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=90.56s)]
*  what the president had to say. We have the biggest business leaders in the world here. They're going [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  to walk away with a lot of checks or a lot of things that you're going to provide and in the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=103.28s)]
*  United States it's probably two million jobs that we're talking about this visit. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  So the president liking to stress how the American people could benefit through jobs and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=116.0s)]
*  investment in the United States and of course touting the wares that he is selling on behalf [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=120.8s)]
*  of the United States defense industry to Saudi Arabia. Again we expect the president to address [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=126.4s)]
*  this economic forum there any minute. Kelly we've seen the Saudis roll out the purple carpet for the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=132.4s)]
*  president. There were Arabian horses, fighter jets. We know Trump loves the pomp and pageantry of his [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=139.12s)]
*  Saudi visits. How much did that factor into this being his first diplomatic trip? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=144.8s)]
*  Well certainly the president has a real affinity for all of those trappings of the office and the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=151.28s)]
*  world stage moments and the Saudis have long been known to do that kind of ceremonial [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=156.88s)]
*  honorifics. All of those things that certainly give the president a feeling of being welcomed [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=163.68s)]
*  and to kind of point out his stature on the world stage. Saudi Arabia was the first stop in his first [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=169.12s)]
*  term as a part of a multi-country visit at that time. Repeating that this time of course he went [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=176.48s)]
*  to Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis but this is the first planned multi-country event with a lot [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=182.4s)]
*  of focus on economic issues but also a nod to the regional concerns and some of the international [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  hot spots with Saudi Arabia being an important influence especially to counter Iran and in the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=195.44s)]
*  president's efforts to have ongoing movement toward normalization with Israel. So it's economic and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  diplomatic from this end so far. Ana? Hagar, how is the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=208.96s)]
*  different now compared to Trump's first term? Well it's even advanced further along these lines. I [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=215.28s)]
*  mean as Kelly mentioned there are these real priorities that are both economic and political [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  and even though former president Biden tried to label Saudi Arabia as an international pariah [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  very quickly he turned on that when he needed Saudi Arabia's help on oil prices and so [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=234.72s)]
*  Saudi Arabia has really remained in that role as a friend of the United States regardless of its [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=241.12s)]
*  human rights abuses and regardless of those condemnations of their human rights abuses [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=246.8s)]
*  but right now that position is even more important not just because it's Trump 2.0 but because of the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=253.28s)]
*  geopolitical dynamics of the region. Saudi Arabia is a real hegemon. You've got a situation now where [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=260.08s)]
*  you're seeing the crumbling of the axis of resistance and what that could do for the future of Middle [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=265.2s)]
*  East peace and the Trump administration sees that and that's why and that's why I thought it was [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=269.84s)]
*  really important that Kelly mentioned you've got potential Saudis real normalization talks that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=273.68s)]
*  could be discussed here and what it means to have these Iran talks because Trump is very focused on [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=277.28s)]
*  preventing a nuclear arms race in the region and Saudi Arabia is key to that. David as we were just [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  discussing the U.S. has a complicated history with this region relying on it for oil for so many [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=288.4s)]
*  decades often turning a blind eye to human rights violations as a result but how unusual is it to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  hear a U.S. president visit the region and not really lean into the diplomatic the security the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=299.44s)]
*  peace rhetoric instead talking about the economy the business dealing sort of a a checkbook first [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=305.2s)]
*  approach if you will. Well it's often in in in our real dealings with Saudi Arabia been at [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=312.08s)]
*  at base an economic relationship we were relied on the Saudis for oil supplies. Saudi Arabia's been [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=320.08s)]
*  been our crucial partner in maintaining to the extent possible stable oil prices. Saudi Arabia [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=327.44s)]
*  interesting and it's a very traditional monarchy it loves the the pomp the the the the ceremonies [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  with the the Arabian horses but it's also a country that is leaping into the 21st century as fast as [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=342.64s)]
*  its people will go. One of the things that Trump will talk about with Saudi business leaders and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=349.04s)]
*  with the business American business leaders he's brought with him is Saudi Arabia's ambition to be [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=353.92s)]
*  an AI powerhouse in the Middle East. They have a state-run company that would like to buy some of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  the fanciest chips that we make to help their AI ambitions along and the final point to just to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=362.8s)]
*  underlie what what Hagar just said. Saudi Arabia is increasingly important strategically. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=370.56s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is the place where Russia and you and Ukrainian officials met with U.S. officials to to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=376.8s)]
*  begin to think about a pathway towards peace where where the U.S. and Russia reconstructed the basics [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=383.36s)]
*  of their diplomatic relationship. So Saudi Arabia is is front and center not just in in money terms [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=391.12s)]
*  but also in in terms of how the U.S. under this administration thinks about security. Hagar even [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=397.12s)]
*  before President Trump departed for this trip there was plenty of controversy over that gifted luxury [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=403.04s)]
*  jet from Qatar plus you have the UAE linked investments in the Trump family's crypto venture. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=408.96s)]
*  What do these countries get out of these moves? Why raise such blatant ethical questions? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  You mean it's not normal behavior? Well so these are countries so there are two two pieces to this [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=423.52s)]
*  two sides of this. On one hand these are obviously these countries believe that with this with the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=429.44s)]
*  Trump administration they're going to overlook or or skirt common ethics standards. Certainly when [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=433.67999999999995s)]
*  I was in government not only could we not have accepted a plane of this kind but we couldn't [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=439.52s)]
*  accept anything over 20 dollars and so there's on one hand there's that that view but then on the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=442.96s)]
*  side of of President Trump there's also a very clear message here that he's sending [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=448.88s)]
*  specific particularly with this being his first overseas trip that he's very interested in big [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=454.47999999999996s)]
*  powers and in big wealthy powers and so those countries hear that message and are also trying [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=460.4s)]
*  to fuel that and as as long as I've worked on on the Middle East it's it's not uncommon regardless [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=465.67999999999995s)]
*  of the president for for these for the Gulf countries in particular and the Middle East [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=471.28s)]
*  to see to to establish these relationships and gifts are often and a way they attempt to to [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=476.23999999999995s)]
*  hone those relationships make them stronger and see if they might not necessarily be a quid pro quo [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=482.96s)]
*  but to try and get favorable favorable deals later on and so I don't want to I don't want to speak [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=487.52s)]
*  for for Qatar on this on this angle but I would be very wary of a plane coming from from a country [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  that has also financed Hamas. And yeah there are national security issues as well with accepting a [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=498.88s)]
*  plane from a foreign government or even you know royal family within a foreign country. David with [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=505.12s)]
*  all the volatility we've been covering that this president has injected into the world economy [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=510.64s)]
*  because of the tariffs and the subsequent frustration we've heard from business leaders [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=515.92s)]
*  what do you make of today's showing of all these super wealthy CEOs in effect kissing the ring in [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=520.72s)]
*  the receiving line this morning? So to me this trip is a symbol of the continuity of global ties [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=526.56s)]
*  the United States has with key allies and partners and you could argue of globalization itself. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=538.3199999999999s)]
*  This comes on the heels of a meeting last weekend that our treasury secretary had with the Chinese [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=545.1199999999999s)]
*  which they seem to have walked back down the hill of the massive terror tariff increases that people [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=549.92s)]
*  worried would blow up the the basic framework for globalization global trade. So I think we're [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=556.64s)]
*  seeing Trump back in the more traditional position of an American president going overseas. There are [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=563.5999999999999s)]
*  you know particular Trump issues like proceed of the of the Air Force one gift from Qatar I can't [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=569.8399999999999s)]
*  imagine any other president facing that problem but that I hope will be worked out in an appropriate [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=575.68s)]
*  way which is to not take the plane but this is to me a more of a trip back to the traditional role [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=581.76s)]
*  of the United States in Saudi Arabia in the Arab world than it is departure. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=590.8s)]
*  you [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8r4dh-Ztqw&t=605.68s)]
