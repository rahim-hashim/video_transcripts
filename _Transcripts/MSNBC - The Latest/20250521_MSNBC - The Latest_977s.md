# Lawrence: The Trump-Republican budget bill is the work of 'sadistic zombies'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo)
*  Well, sadistic zombies is not the kind of phrase you expect from Nobel Prize winning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=0.0s)]
*  economist Paul Krugman, who will be joining our program this evening. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=5.4s)]
*  Professor Krugman is a former columnist for the New York Times whose invaluable writing [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=9.64s)]
*  now appears on Substack where everyone can and who can should absolutely make an effort [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=14.38s)]
*  to read it and learn. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=20.04s)]
*  Read it and learn seems to be something Donald Trump has never been able to do and the Republicans [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=21.76s)]
*  he dominates in Congress seem to have the same deficiency. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=26.94s)]
*  The cruelty of the budget bill designed by Donald Trump and the Republican Congress has [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=31.5s)]
*  provoked the mild-mannered Professor Krugman, not known for rhetorical excess, to call Donald [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=36.980000000000004s)]
*  Trump and the Republican Congress sadistic zombies. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=45.92s)]
*  And I will take the liberty during this hour to extend Professor Krugman's term to include [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=51.08s)]
*  the Trump ally who actually might be the most sadistic of all, Elon Musk, into the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=56.54s)]
*  group of sadistic zombies now trying to control our governing and in Elon Musk's case trying [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=65.04s)]
*  to control this starving little girl in a refugee camp near South Sudan because Elon [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=74.1s)]
*  Musk believes that she, the girl you're looking at right there, Elon Musk believes that she [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=83.54s)]
*  has received too much free food from you, too much free food from the United States [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=88.74s)]
*  of America. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=97.52s)]
*  The United States of America has been producing more food than we can consume for more than [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=100.1s)]
*  a century now and we have been sending food aid around the world for almost 200 years [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=104.66s)]
*  as we did during the Irish famine in 1847. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=109.86s)]
*  Former USAID official Dr. Atul Gawande is in Africa tonight where he has seen what these [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=114.74s)]
*  sadistic zombies have done to that little girl and to people who need the HIV care that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  the United States has been supplying thanks to a program created by Republican President [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=128.22s)]
*  George W. Bush, but no more. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=134.06s)]
*  Dr. Atul Gawande will join us later in this hour. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=137.46s)]
*  The sadistic zombies are trying to take food aid away from people here in the United States [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=141.74s)]
*  who need food aid. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  They're trying to take that away from people in their budget bill. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=151.5s)]
*  They are trying to take health care away from the people who earn the least amount of money [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=155.94s)]
*  in this country. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  They are trying to take health care away from Medicaid recipients. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=163.38s)]
*  They are trying to give the most massive tax cut in history to Elon Musk and other billionaires [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=167.46s)]
*  while still maintaining a much heavier tax burden on many taxpayers and on working couples, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=174.57999999999998s)]
*  for example, who are very well paid, who can no longer deduct all of their state and local [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=181.62s)]
*  taxes on their federal tax returns because Donald Trump and the Republicans eliminated [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=186.7s)]
*  the possibility of deducting all of your state and local taxes from your federal tax returns, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=191.06s)]
*  which we've all been able to do during our entire lives. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=196.5s)]
*  They did that during the first Trump presidency. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=199.3s)]
*  Donald Trump actually increased significantly the tax burden on those taxpayers who ended [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  up paying much more in their overall tax burden, even though their federal income tax rate [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=207.78s)]
*  was technically and slightly reduced. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=214.06s)]
*  Those taxpayers are not happy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=218.14000000000001s)]
*  Those taxpayers live in Long Island. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=220.02s)]
*  Some of them voted for Republican members of the House who are now betraying their promise [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=221.78s)]
*  to restore those taxpayers' ability to fully deduct their state and local taxes, like they [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=229.3s)]
*  did their entire lives until Donald Trump took that away from them and, in effect, raised [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=236.34s)]
*  their tax bills enormously. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=242.10000000000002s)]
*  That's one of the problems with the Republican tax bill, is how do you get those Republican [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=245.3s)]
*  House members in New York, in California, who lied about this in their campaign, saying [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=251.9s)]
*  they were going to fix this, how do you get them to vote for that bill and betray their [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=257.94s)]
*  voters? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=263.42s)]
*  They promised they would fix that problem for them. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=264.66s)]
*  The Republican House leadership is pushing forward to try to pass a bill for a president [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=268.22s)]
*  who has no idea what he is doing, a president who has no idea how the American economy and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=273.06s)]
*  the global economy actually work. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=278.17999999999995s)]
*  And finally, Donald Trump's overwhelming stupidity about all of that has finally, finally, finally [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=280.62s)]
*  broken through to American voters, with now 66% disapproving tonight of how Donald Trump [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=292.58s)]
*  is dealing with inflation and the cost of living, the reason so many voters voted for [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=302.42s)]
*  him. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=307.3s)]
*  63% disapprove of Donald Trump's tariffs, all of which, by the way, are illegal, and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=308.3s)]
*  58% disapprove of how Donald Trump is handling economic issues generally. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=315.90000000000003s)]
*  The utterly fraudulent notion that the successful businessman Donald Trump was very good at [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=321.06s)]
*  the economic side of the presidency has evaporated, and it did evaporate even before Donald Trump [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=329.14000000000004s)]
*  reached the 100-day mark of this presidency. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=335.94s)]
*  And now, with the most recent polling right now in May, even after Donald Trump has retreated [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=338.42s)]
*  from his most inane illegal tariffs, American voters are not quickly forgiving him for his [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=344.22s)]
*  tariff madness that crashed the stock market and scared them for very good reason, and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=351.78s)]
*  the tariff madness that they will still suffer the next time they go into a Target or any [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=359.78s)]
*  other store. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=364.17999999999995s)]
*  And so casting a vote for policies advocated by a popular president is one thing, but casting [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=366.21999999999997s)]
*  a vote on economic policy and a budget for a president who two-thirds of the country [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=372.05999999999995s)]
*  believes does not know what he is doing on economic policy is something that could only [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=378.5s)]
*  be done by people who are not thinking about what they are doing, people who are approaching [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=384.06s)]
*  the Republican budget process like what Paul Krugman calls zombies, sadistic zombies. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=388.7s)]
*  And if they win, if the sadistic zombies win, they will lose. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=398.7s)]
*  If the Republicans win the vote in the House of Representatives, they might then lose the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=405.3s)]
*  vote in the United States Senate and throw the Republican Congress into utter chaos for [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=409.02000000000004s)]
*  the rest of the year. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=413.02000000000004s)]
*  But if they win the vote on this budget bill in the House and then they win a vote in the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=414.18s)]
*  Senate on the same budget bill, they will then have the booby prize of having passed [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=419.18s)]
*  the cruelest budget bill ever passed in American history and signed into law by the cruelest [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=426.18s)]
*  president. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=432.98s)]
*  And they will take that cruelty with them into the next congressional election and see [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=433.98s)]
*  how it goes. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=439.78000000000003s)]
*  See if those 66 percent who oppose what Donald Trump is doing now will thank them next November [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=441.34000000000003s)]
*  for helping visit that cruelty upon them or upon their neighbors or upon their grandmothers. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=448.88s)]
*  Every voter in the next congressional election is going to know that Donald Trump lied when [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=456.42s)]
*  he said this. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=462.58s)]
*  We're cutting three things, waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=463.58s)]
*  We're not changing Medicaid and we're not changing Medicare and we're not changing Social [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=468.9s)]
*  Security. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=473.85999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump is changing Medicaid and the Republican Congress is helping Donald Trump [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=475.97999999999996s)]
*  change Medicaid. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=481.21999999999997s)]
*  And as we learned in breaking news on this program 24 hours ago, Donald Trump is changing [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=482.53999999999996s)]
*  Medicare, cutting Medicare. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=488.32s)]
*  And that is exactly what House Republicans are determined to do. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=490.86s)]
*  They are going to vote to cut Medicare in this bill. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=494.3s)]
*  Last night at this hour, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, Brendan Boyle, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=498.26s)]
*  joined us and brought the breaking news directly from the Congressional Budget Office who [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=502.58000000000004s)]
*  had just informed Congressman Boyle that the Republican budget bill would trigger cuts [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=508.28000000000003s)]
*  even though Medicare is not mentioned in the Republican budget bill. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=515.84s)]
*  Congressman Boyle explained, as I interpreted at the time, that it was the interaction of [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=523.1600000000001s)]
*  the Medicaid cuts and the rest of the budget bill that would force in effect these cuts [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=527.72s)]
*  on Medicare. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=534.64s)]
*  Three hours later, Congressman Boyle was officially delivering that news to the House Rules Committee, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=536.1600000000001s)]
*  which began a hearing in the middle of the night last night that is a necessary procedural [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=542.48s)]
*  step before bringing the budget bill to the floor of the House for a vote by the full [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=546.7s)]
*  House of Representatives. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  That hearing got underway at 1 20 a.m. and the top Democrat on that committee, the Rules [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=552.26s)]
*  Committee, Congressman Jim McGovern, began his participation in that hearing this way. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=559.36s)]
*  I've got a simple question. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=566.12s)]
*  What the hell are Republicans so afraid of? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=567.9200000000001s)]
*  What the hell are you so scared of that you guys are holding this hearing at one o'clock [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=570.76s)]
*  in the morning? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=574.56s)]
*  It's a simple question that speaks to the heart of what's going on here and one that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=576.12s)]
*  I'm going to keep on asking. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=579.68s)]
*  If Republicans are so proud of what is in this bill, then why are you trying to ram it [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=581.48s)]
*  through in the dead of night? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=586.04s)]
*  So after Congressman Brendan Boyle broke the news about the $500 billion cut to Medicare [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=588.64s)]
*  on this program last night, the biggest cut to Medicare in the history of the Medicare [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=593.8s)]
*  program, it was no surprise in that hearing room at 2 15 a.m. when Congressman Boyle testified [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=598.76s)]
*  to the committee. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  As you know, statutory pay go, which stands for pay as you go, is a law that requires [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=609.3199999999999s)]
*  tax cuts and spending increases to be offset, meaning that they do not add to the deficit. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=616.04s)]
*  If at the end of the year, congressional legislation collectively violates pay go, those deficit [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=621.92s)]
*  effects trigger across the board cuts to programs like Medicare. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=627.56s)]
*  Does this bill trigger statutory pay go? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=632.72s)]
*  Yes, and it's not me saying it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=635.88s)]
*  It is the Congressional Budget Office confirming it as of a couple hours ago. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=638.68s)]
*  And look, this is really the breaking news because when the Budget Committee kicked off [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=643.4s)]
*  this process approximately three months ago, there was a commitment by President Trump [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=648.62s)]
*  that there would be no Medicare cuts in this piece of legislation. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=653.5600000000001s)]
*  And indeed, over the last several months, there has been no discussion of Medicare at [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=657.52s)]
*  all. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=662.2s)]
*  There has been of Medicaid, but not of Medicare. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=663.2s)]
*  Well, here we are tonight because, as you explained, because of the size of the deficits, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=665.6800000000001s)]
*  because of the pay go or pay as you go act, that would trigger sequestration of Medicare [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=672.52s)]
*  and it would total over $500 billion. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=679.52s)]
*  The official figure that CBO confirms is $535 billion in cuts to Medicare. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=682.76s)]
*  So the Rules Committee got that breaking news, as the Congressman called it, formally presented [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=691.16s)]
*  to them about four hours after you got it here on this program from Congressman Boyle. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=696.06s)]
*  And so Donald Trump is cutting Medicaid after promising not to and he's cutting Medicare [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=702.16s)]
*  after promising not to. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=709.6s)]
*  And while he's doing that, exactly at the same time he's doing that, he is taking a [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=712.34s)]
*  free plane from a Middle Eastern dictator who funds a MAS while Donald Trump is cutting [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=717.4200000000001s)]
*  your Medicaid or your Medicare or your grandmother's Medicaid and Medicare. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=724.14s)]
*  Medicaid is the single largest payer to nursing homes in America and Donald Trump is cutting [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=729.38s)]
*  that program. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=734.3000000000001s)]
*  Medicaid is the single largest provider of health care coverage for poor children and [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=735.96s)]
*  poor babies in America and Donald Trump is cutting that funding. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=740.42s)]
*  And while he's doing it, he's taking a free plane from a dictator who was trying to sell [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=744.02s)]
*  that plane, which is 13 years old and not good enough for the dictator and couldn't [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=748.96s)]
*  find a buyer. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=754.36s)]
*  And so instead the dictator decided he'd rather have Donald Trump owe him. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=756.24s)]
*  It helped that there were absolutely no buyers for that 13 year old 747 on the used plane [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=762.46s)]
*  market these days. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=768.1s)]
*  The listed value of that used plane is 400 million dollars, which is much, much less [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=769.66s)]
*  than that same dictator has given to Hamas and gave to Hamas before Hamas's October [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=777.62s)]
*  7th attack on Israel. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=785.1s)]
*  The Defense Department, in full participation in the international scheme to violate the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=788.74s)]
*  and give Donald Trump a free plane, formally accepted the free 747 from the dictator of [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=794.4000000000001s)]
*  Qatar today. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=801.12s)]
*  And now Donald Trump is the first president in history to try to have three, count them, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=803.08s)]
*  three Air Force Ones. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=810.6400000000001s)]
*  We've always had two identical Air Force One aircraft ready to take the president anywhere [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=812.1600000000001s)]
*  in the world to make sure an Air Force One is always ready. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=817.36s)]
*  There have to be two planes so that there's a backup plane in case one plane has a problem. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=819.8s)]
*  And now Donald Trump wants a third Air Force One at a massive cost to taxpayers. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=824.3599999999999s)]
*  And that's the part where this scheme might just break down. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=831.3599999999999s)]
*  The country has never needed a third Air Force One. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=836.56s)]
*  The country has never paid a nickel to have a third Air Force One. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=839.92s)]
*  Congress has never paid a nickel for a third Air Force One. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=844.76s)]
*  And Congress will have to pay for that third Air Force One to be converted into a usable [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=847.96s)]
*  Air Force One, which is estimated to cost at least a billion dollars. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=855.04s)]
*  Now Donald Trump's going to pay a billion dollars of your money to have a dictator's [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=859.0s)]
*  so-called flying palace converted into a usable Air Force One. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=863.96s)]
*  But Congress controls that billion dollars. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=868.8s)]
*  He's going to have to come to Congress for that money. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=872.28s)]
*  It is very unlikely he's going to get that money, even from the sadistic zombies. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=876.48s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to do all this while Boeing is building two new versions of Air Force [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=883.96s)]
*  One that were ordered while Donald Trump was president the first time. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=890.58s)]
*  This is so perfectly Trumpian. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=896.08s)]
*  This is Donald Trump's Marie Antoinette moment of obliviousness to the suffering he is causing, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=898.04s)]
*  while Donald Antoinette dreams of the cake and McDonald's junk food he will have on [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=903.76s)]
*  the free plane that the dictator has given him so that Donald Trump will be able to use [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=910.3199999999999s)]
*  that plane as his personal plane after his presidency, because that's the scheme. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=915.4399999999999s)]
*  The scheme is for Donald Trump's Defense Department to deliver that plane as a gift to Donald [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=920.92s)]
*  Trump's presidential library when Donald Trump is leaving office so that Donald Trump [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=926.92s)]
*  will have full custody of a former dictator's palatial 747 to fly wherever Donald Trump [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=932.16s)]
*  wants to for the rest of his life. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=940.16s)]
*  That is the scheme, and that scheme is the work of sadistic zombies. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzXaL5aYVo&t=943.1999999999999s)]
