# ‘Done enormous damage’: Musk says time at DOGE will ‘drop significantly’ as Tesla earnings plunge
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM)
*  Tesla profits have taken a plunge with the stock tumbling by more than 40% this year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=0.0s)]
*  That's why Elon Musk on his company's earnings call Tuesday said that while he will be stepping back from the White House Doge office in May. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=6.0s)]
*  Starting probably in next month, May, my time allocation to Doge will drop significantly. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=16.0s)]
*  I'll have to continue doing it for the remainder of the president's term just to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stop does not come roaring back. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=28.0s)]
*  Joining me now to MSNBC political analyst Tim O'Brien, Senior Executive Editor of Bloomberg Opinion and Eddie Glaude, political scholar and professor at Princeton University. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=41.0s)]
*  Their faces during the listening were priceless. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=50.0s)]
*  The emperor has no clothes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=54.0s)]
*  The emperor has no clothes and I think this administration now is challenged as a whole for the American public to continue believing what they're saying. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=55.0s)]
*  But Musk in miniature on this earnings call demonstrated all of the problems. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=66.0s)]
*  He's an authentic pioneer in the electronic vehicle industry and commercializing space. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=71.0s)]
*  Notable success is there. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=78.0s)]
*  That doesn't mean however, there's a universal genius and Donald Trump brought him into the federal government to supposedly clean up government waste. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=80.0s)]
*  He had no experience around any of it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=88.0s)]
*  He's actually done an enormous amount of damage. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=91.0s)]
*  He's cleaned out agencies that were populated by workers who had experience and expertise he lacked. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=93.0s)]
*  You can just look at an agency like the IRS, which did you see the Axios reporting about the fact that he and Scott Besson got into a screaming about? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=99.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=108.0s)]
*  And administrations have tried this before Trump. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=109.0s)]
*  The Trump administration is not the first one to try to create an efficiency program within the federal bureaucracy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=114.0s)]
*  The Gore administration did it, but they did it surgically. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=121.0s)]
*  They did it with people who knew what they were doing and running or making the federal government more efficient is not like running a business, even though we hear that all the time. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=124.0s)]
*  Businesses are bottom line oriented. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=132.0s)]
*  Governments provide services to people and it requires people who have an insight into how the services function and how you incentivize the people who work there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=134.0s)]
*  And Musk had none of that going for him. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=144.0s)]
*  They have not drawn down the size of the federal government. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=147.0s)]
*  They've done more damage than good. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=150.0s)]
*  And he's leaving because of that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=152.0s)]
*  In addition to the fact that the profits of his company are down 71 percent. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=155.0s)]
*  More because of tariffs, but we'll get to that in a second. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=160.0s)]
*  What does it say about the rest of us that we've allowed this to happen? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=162.0s)]
*  I think I want to flip it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=165.0s)]
*  I mean, we have all the things that Tim just laid out about Musk, but I think it shows that everyday ordinary people, Americans are making choices in reaction to things that they reject. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=166.0s)]
*  So the 71 percent drop, right, is, of course, tied to tariffs. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=177.0s)]
*  But it's also tied to the fact that people are making serious choices. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=180.0s)]
*  They don't want to buy us products anymore. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=184.0s)]
*  So you get even those who have their cars, you see bumper stickers. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=185.0s)]
*  I bought this before Elon Musk went crazy, that sort of thing. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=188.0s)]
*  And so I think it shows the power of everyday ordinary folk, right, that we can make a decision by by what we decide to purchase, by what we decide to bring into our homes. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=191.0s)]
*  Right. And it can be a judgment. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=201.0s)]
*  It can it could reveal a substantive judgment about what these people are doing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=203.0s)]
*  Did you see the sound? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=207.0s)]
*  I'll play it for you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=209.0s)]
*  Congressman Byron Donalds. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=210.0s)]
*  He was at a town hall on Monday. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=213.0s)]
*  This is what he heard from his constituents. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=215.0s)]
*  What does is doing right now is they're going through every agency and they're examining any contracts or any lack of efficiencies in spending federal dollars. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=218.0s)]
*  This is something that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=228.0s)]
*  I'm going to answer you. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=231.0s)]
*  I'm going to answer you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=233.0s)]
*  Elon Musk and those have been authorized by the president. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=234.0s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=241.0s)]
*  So there's the reality, as you said, and I think you're right, that people are making their voices heard through their consumer choices. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=244.0s)]
*  There's also the reality of Americans making their voices heard by showing up at a town hall and saying, maybe I'm going to vote it for you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=250.0s)]
*  But this isn't what I thought I was getting. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=257.0s)]
*  I think this reveals, as I've said before, the kind of conflicting or converging or kind of the two different strands within the MAGA movement. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=260.0s)]
*  Right. You have the billionaire boys who want to take over the reins of government and do what they want to do. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=269.0s)]
*  And then you have the right wing populism of Steve Bannon. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=274.0s)]
*  Right. And Bannon and Musk have bumped heads before. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=277.0s)]
*  And so when we hear this sort of response, right, that is to say they didn't elect elect a billionaire to control government. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=279.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=286.0s)]
*  Their idea was, in fact, to kind of shrink the size of government in light of their own suspicion of it, not to hand it over to a billionaire who's acting in self-interest. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=287.0s)]
*  So that right wing populist element of MAGA isn't going away and it's making his voice known. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=296.0s)]
*  What do you think that Doge or the Doge adjacent efforts look like without Musk there? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=303.0s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, the whole thing to me was performative. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=311.0s)]
*  You know, you won't have the world's richest person running around a stage with a chainsaw over his head. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=314.0s)]
*  But are we really going to miss that? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=320.0s)]
*  No, but I almost wonder if it takes away the the avatar for it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=322.0s)]
*  Right. If Doge just then becomes sort of the mechanics of deconstructing the administrative state without someone who is quite the lightning bolt. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=327.0s)]
*  I mean, I think they will still go about that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=336.0s)]
*  I think actually the genius behind all of this, the force behind all this is Stephen Miller, not Elon Musk. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=339.0s)]
*  I think Stephen Miller has a hand in a lot of the things that are now reaching down to voters where they live, where they eat, where they shop. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=346.0s)]
*  And the people I think I wish had known better or paid more attention before Trump got elected, because we saw this when Chuck Grassley did a town hall in Iowa. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=355.0s)]
*  And and and they were outraged about due process getting trashed by the Trump administration. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=365.0s)]
*  You have people now getting upset that the federal government and the services provides are getting trashed. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=371.0s)]
*  People should have paid attention to that more closely when Trump was running because it's come for them now. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=376.0s)]
*  But it is good to see that Americans are stepping up and complaining about it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=381.0s)]
*  You [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXCmvKV7lM&t=395.0s)]
