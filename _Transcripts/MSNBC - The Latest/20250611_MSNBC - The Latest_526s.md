# ‘Disturbing’: Attorney explains why Trump sending Marines to L.A. is legally questionable
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs)
*  We want to bring in NBC's Camila Bernal in Los Angeles. Peter Baker is a New York Times [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=0.0s)]
*  White House correspondent and of course MSNBC political analyst. Retired Army Colonel Jack [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=4.24s)]
*  Jacobs is a Vietnam vet, a recipient of the Medal of Honor and an MSNBC military analyst. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  And Barbara McQuade is a former U.S. attorney law professor at the University of Michigan. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=14.72s)]
*  And what else? An MSNBC legal analyst. Peter, I want to start with you. Ending the protests in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=18.96s)]
*  LA is what the administration is saying is their stated goal. But are you hearing anything about [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=24.56s)]
*  how the White House feels about the protests spilling over to other cities? We've talked about [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  how the White House is, this is a fight the White House is willing to have. Are they okay with this [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  happening if it kind of proves their point? Well it certainly puts the issue of immigration front [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=40.56s)]
*  and center and that's an issue that the president has most wanted to emphasize since taking office. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=47.2s)]
*  The images of ICE agents rounding up immigrants and arresting them for deportation is exactly the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=52.48s)]
*  message he's trying to show, exactly the message he's trying to send. And if there are protests in [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=61.04s)]
*  response, particularly if the protests turn in some cases violent, then from his point of view [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=66.0s)]
*  in a political sense this is okay with him because it shows he is a tough man and he is attacking what [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=71.84s)]
*  he considers to be one of the major problems of the country. Now if you actually look at the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=78.72s)]
*  numbers he hasn't come anywhere near what he's promised to do in terms of deportations. That's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=84.4s)]
*  why images are important because the numbers aren't actually backing up what he said he would do. He [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=89.28s)]
*  said he would get rid of all 11 million people who are in this country illegally by the time he's done [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  with his four years term. There's no way he would get anywhere close to that. He wouldn't even get [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=97.52s)]
*  a fraction of that at the pace that they're going. But because they've done some of these arrests in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=101.6s)]
*  such a spectacular and public fashion with ICE agents, with masks on and in public places, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=105.84s)]
*  they're exercising a show of force that he wants to display to the public. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=111.84s)]
*  Yeah, Colonel, the political theater element of this seems important and I want to ask how you [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  feel about does putting the National Guard and troops on the streets of one American city [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=124.64s)]
*  lower the threshold for bringing them into other places, especially if we see these protests start [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=129.12s)]
*  to expand across the country? Well, it almost certainly does. But it's interesting to address [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=133.52s)]
*  the capabilities that forces were talking about. The National Guard belongs to the governor. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=139.36s)]
*  For them to be deputized by the federal government means that there is some threat that can't be [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  it can't be addressed at the local level, at the state level. The National Guard trains often to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=155.44s)]
*  in these kinds of situations for crowd control and so on to restore order in exactly these kinds of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=164.48s)]
*  situations, but to bring in active duty troops, that's different altogether. And at some juncture, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=171.2s)]
*  they're not capable of doing this because they don't train to do these kinds of things. Whereas [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=179.2s)]
*  National Guard troops do the National Guard troops belong to the governor who is fully [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=183.92s)]
*  capable of employing them to do the kinds of crowd control things the federal government is [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=192.32s)]
*  looking to do, but put them under the auspices of the federal government does lower the threshold [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=197.44s)]
*  for them to be used elsewhere in similar situations. Christina and Camila, the mayor of Los Angeles [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=203.27999999999997s)]
*  imposed this curfew. It seemed to keep things a little calmer last night than it was previously. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=209.68s)]
*  I know she's not in front of cameras today. What have we heard from her so far? Yeah, Mayor Karen [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=214.32s)]
*  Bass saying that it worked, that it was effective. That curfew went into effect at around 8 p.m. local [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=219.12s)]
*  time and a few hours later, things were calm in the streets of L.A. And we have seen some of that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=224.72s)]
*  throughout the last couple of days when they declare an unlawful assembly. And so what they [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  did last night was they arrested a number of people for unlawful assembly and for violating [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=235.76s)]
*  that curfew. The mayor did say there were arrests that were made for those violations, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=240.64s)]
*  but for the most part she believes that this was successful. Another thing that she really [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  likes to point out is that of L.A. there's about 500 square miles and the curfew only implemented [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=251.12s)]
*  in about two of those square miles. So it really represents the size of the protest in comparison [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=257.36s)]
*  to L.A. as a whole. She did say that there are people who like to start the fights, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=262.96s)]
*  who like to escalate things, but she says that is not everyone. Take a listen. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=268.64s)]
*  Are there dangerous individuals that are here in Los Angeles? Yes. Are we harboring them? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=274.96s)]
*  No. I think that the idea that what is going on here is chaos and we need federal intervention [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=279.67999999999995s)]
*  is just not accurate. It doesn't paint an accurate picture of what's going on here at all. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=287.84s)]
*  And in addition to the arrests that they made last night over the curfew, there were also a lot of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=294.96s)]
*  arrests that were made after those protesters tried to get on the 101 freeway. Officials saying [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=300.08s)]
*  that's not going to happen. They're also saying there needs to be a stop to the looting and the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=305.28s)]
*  graffiti in downtown Los Angeles. And Mayor Bass saying that did not happen last night, although [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=309.28s)]
*  it has happened over the last couple of days. There's another protest scheduled for today. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=315.04s)]
*  We're mostly peaceful yesterday. We're waiting to see what happens today as this back and forth [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=320.8s)]
*  continues. But the one thing they keep pointing back to is the start of these protests. It's the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=325.76000000000005s)]
*  raids, the way in which the Trump administration has gone out to essentially detain a lot of the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  people here in Los Angeles who are undocumented. And there is this sort of fear that they'll go [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=337.92s)]
*  to your workplace, that they'll go to the schools, that you'll see federal agents. And there is a [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=342.88s)]
*  lot of a large undocumented population here in Los Angeles. They're sort of in the makeup of the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=347.68s)]
*  Los Angeles population. People believe that they're their neighbors, their friends. They see them [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=355.44s)]
*  every day. So there is definitely that fear when you talk about raids here in Los Angeles. And [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=360.64s)]
*  there's a lot of people here who don't want to see the National Guard on their streets. And of course, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=366.32s)]
*  they also don't want to see the Marines here. And Barbara, the governor has asked for this emergency [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=370.72s)]
*  intervention to stop the troop deployment. He didn't get it. But there's a hearing set for [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  tomorrow. Tell us about that hearing and how you think it could change the dynamic on the ground, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  especially if this trend continues where the protests seem to be calming down a little bit, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=386.24s)]
*  at least for now. Yes, the state of California filed a lawsuit arguing that the use of federal [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=391.12s)]
*  troops in this situation violates the law. Although they didn't get that temporary restraining [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=399.76s)]
*  order yesterday, the court set a very quick hearing for tomorrow. So I don't know that that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=404.96s)]
*  should in any way suggest that the judge thinks that the case is not strong on the merits. I think [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  they just wanted both sides to be present so that the court could get a hearing from both sides of [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=414.48s)]
*  this argument, because it presents some sort of novel legal issues. We haven't seen this exercise [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=420.24s)]
*  of presidential power before. So the thing that the state of California is pointing to is a provision [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=425.76s)]
*  in the statute that allows the president to call up a state's national guard that says it shall [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=431.76s)]
*  issue through the office of the governor. Shall is the word there. In no way did the Trump [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  administration reach out to the governor's office in this instance. And in fact, the governor says, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=441.84s)]
*  we don't want you here. You are riling things up. You are making it worse. And so they allege that's [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=445.92s)]
*  a violation of the president's authority of the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, which gives [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=450.56s)]
*  power to the state and the Administrative Procedure Act, which prohibits the federal [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=455.2s)]
*  government, federal agencies from entering into any order that is arbitrary or capricious. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=459.92s)]
*  So we'll see what happens in that hearing tomorrow. I think one thing that is more disturbing, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=465.36s)]
*  perhaps, is the addition of the Marines who have now joined in the effort with the National Guard. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=469.84s)]
*  There is some legal argument to be made that the National Guard belongs there, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=476.0s)]
*  but sending in the Marine Corps now brings in a different authority. It's not really [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=479.52s)]
*  specified other than the Insurrection Act, which the president has not invoked, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=485.36s)]
*  and this is what seems to be an invocation of the president's inherent power under the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=490.08s)]
*  Constitution. So this is an escalation of presidential power that President Trump is [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=495.52s)]
*  asserting. And it will be very interesting to see whether a court reigns that in or blesses it. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJ5Suw4Zcs&t=500.71999999999997s)]
