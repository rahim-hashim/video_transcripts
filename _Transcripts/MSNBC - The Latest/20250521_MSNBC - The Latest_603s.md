# See it! Trump ‘czar’ LIVE ON MSNBC pressed on DOJ dropping Dem mayor’s case, ICE clash
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro)
*  As you may have seen, we had Mayor Baraka on earlier. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=0.0s)]
*  It was an immigration-related offense, as you know, where the Trump DOJ accused him [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=3.6s)]
*  of trespassing, physically arrested him, indicted him, took him to court. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=8.96s)]
*  And here we are, week and a half later, the whole case falls apart. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=13.48s)]
*  He says no one has apologized to him from the administration. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=17.52s)]
*  What do you say to him tonight? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  I think it was a ridiculous interview. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  I listened to it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=25.92s)]
*  Look, he's running for higher political office. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=27.2s)]
*  He got exactly what he wanted. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  He went there to get on camera and cause a ruckus, and that's what he got. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=30.119999999999997s)]
*  And as far as the case falling apart, I think it'd be only fair to invite Alina Hopper to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  your show to discuss why the case wasn't further prosecuted. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=38.32s)]
*  She's fully invited, and you're on here now from the Trump administration. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=41.96s)]
*  Yes, we'll have people on. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=45.76s)]
*  But you're assuming the case fell apart. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=47.28s)]
*  You're assuming the case fell apart. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=49.28s)]
*  I know that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=50.28s)]
*  I know this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=51.28s)]
*  I know this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=52.28s)]
*  The facts I have. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=53.28s)]
*  I know the mayor was on the facility. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=54.28s)]
*  I'm not assuming anything. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  I'm quoting from the Justice Department that you work with as law enforcement. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  They went to court today. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  They said in court, under penalty of perjury, they made a mistake and dropped the case. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=63.84s)]
*  Not an assumption. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=68.18s)]
*  I'm referring to what your own administration's doing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=69.18s)]
*  They use the terms the case fell apart? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=73.4s)]
*  They use the terms, if you want to get into it, that they made a mistake. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the case is over. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=79.2s)]
*  They dropped it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=80.44s)]
*  I don't think there's a dispute that they dropped the case. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=82.12s)]
*  Here's what I know about the case. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=84.84s)]
*  The mayor was on the property. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=86.4s)]
*  He was asked numerous times to leave and refused to leave. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=88.88s)]
*  As far as the facility itself, I'll put that facility up against any New Jersey facility, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=92.36s)]
*  any county jail, any state prison. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  This facility had the highest detention standards in the industry. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  There's nothing to force your way in on. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  We do oversight visits all the time. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=107.12s)]
*  Do it the right way. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  Contact guys. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  Enter the facility and see anything you want to see. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=112.08s)]
*  What they did is force their way into the facility, refused to leave when asked to leave, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=114.8s)]
*  and the congresswoman, she put hands on an ICE officer. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=120.08s)]
*  All right, so you're jumping to her. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=123.32s)]
*  I'll tell you what, sir. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  Let's finish with the mayor. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=126.28s)]
*  Then we can talk about her if you brought her up. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=127.28s)]
*  Here's what Mayor Baraka said just tonight. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=129.0s)]
*  The federal prosecutor that was there today, basically after the judge asked him, did he [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=132.84s)]
*  have anything to say? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=137.92s)]
*  After reviewing the evidence and the videos and everything else, we agreed that this case [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  should in fact be dismissed. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  And that was their way of saying, you know, we made a mistake. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  And I think that's about as far as these people are going to go because I think this is clearly [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=151.04s)]
*  being driven by their desire to do what was said earlier, to hurt people, to embarrass [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=156.64s)]
*  people, to humiliate folks. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=161.11999999999998s)]
*  And they'll go further than that if they can. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=163.6s)]
*  Independent reports say he was initially allowed past the fence. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=166.2s)]
*  I'm reading that invited past the gates before he was arrested, seemingly contradicting accusations. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=169.6s)]
*  He barged into the facility. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  He was asked to leave multiple times and quote, exited voluntarily. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  That's according to an independent account. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=179.64s)]
*  There's videos on that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  Federal agents wearing face coverings and fatigues appeared outside the gates to arrest [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  the mayor. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  I said I'd give you time to respond. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=189.12s)]
*  Well, that's a different count than I got. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=190.12s)]
*  Again, I wasn't there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=193.16s)]
*  I'm counting on the account provided by geo officials and ICE officials. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=194.16s)]
*  So again, I wasn't there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=198.84s)]
*  You know, it played out in court. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=200.32s)]
*  But I think using the terms, the case fell apart. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=202.32s)]
*  I think it's wrong. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=205.0s)]
*  I think I think they reached terms. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=206.0s)]
*  And again, I'm not they dropped the case in court and they were rebuked by a judge. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I understand you weren't there and I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  But if you weren't there, but I'm showing you what happened. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  This is being done. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=218.8s)]
*  For the mayor to add, this is being done to hurt people and embarrass people. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=221.44s)]
*  And you know, let's remember no one weaponized the Justice Department more than the Biden [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=224.68s)]
*  administration did, for God's sakes, against President Trump. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  People feel it with him, whether it's, you know, it's a ban and whether, you know, a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=232.4s)]
*  member of the Trump administration that they locked up. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, no one weaponized the Justice Department and the federal government more than the Biden [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=239.36s)]
*  administration did. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=243.28s)]
*  So I find it shocking that the Democratic Party are going to talk about us, you know, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=244.54000000000002s)]
*  weaponized the Justice Department. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=249.84s)]
*  It's just ridiculous. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=250.84s)]
*  Well, is that what you're saying? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=251.84s)]
*  They did it so you can do it? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=253.0s)]
*  That's not what I'm saying at all. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=254.0s)]
*  But to make the allegations that were weaponized in the Justice Department, they crossed the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=257.76s)]
*  line that congressman crossed the line. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=261.96s)]
*  She put hands on an ICE officer. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, so we'll move to her. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=266.04s)]
*  You can move to we'll move to the congressman. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=267.76s)]
*  But just to finish the point here, when you look at the investigations, it's a lot of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=270.8s)]
*  critics of Donald Trump and Democrats. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=276.76s)]
*  Can you think of her name? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=279.28s)]
*  Any public official or individual who's in these crosshairs other than those folks? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  I've got some up on the screen. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  It goes from Cuomo to Comey to Springsteen at this point. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  Those who those who break the law should be prosecuted. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  And I don't know if any of these people have been prosecuted. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  At least I'm looking at the screen now. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=302.0s)]
*  If any of them people have been prosecuted other than the congresswoman and other than [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=303.28s)]
*  two judges that on peter long peter ice and try to harbor and conceal legal alien and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=307.92s)]
*  in peter enforcement efforts. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=314.76s)]
*  So no, I that list shows I can't see everybody on that list. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  But are you telling me everybody in the list been indicted? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=320.20000000000005s)]
*  No, it says investigation or arrested if they violate the law. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  No, it's investigations. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=326.6s)]
*  But the fact that so many in these first 110 days, some of them which are announced on [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=327.8s)]
*  social media or other avenues before the defendants or even read their rights and given information [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=331.6s)]
*  raises the question that it looks like to some that this is political targeting. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=338.24s)]
*  The ACLU says it's autocratic targeting. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=343.48s)]
*  And you respond tonight by saying, well, they did it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=345.68s)]
*  The Democrats did it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=348.04s)]
*  Well, if they did it, that's your view. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=348.84s)]
*  Does that make it OK? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=350.64s)]
*  Are you? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=351.68s)]
*  That's what I'm asking. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=352.04s)]
*  I said I find I wait a minute. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=352.64s)]
*  I said I find it shocking that they were accused of Trump administration of weaponizing against [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=354.68s)]
*  their opponents when they did the exact thing during the Biden administration. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=359.8s)]
*  I'm not making any comparison. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=364.32s)]
*  I'm just saying I find it shocking then to make that claim when they did it for four years. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=365.92s)]
*  I don't I'm not making any claim. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=369.92s)]
*  We're weaponizing anything. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=371.48s)]
*  I don't think President Trump is weaponizing anything against his political opponents. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=372.76s)]
*  We're enforcing the law. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  We're investigating crimes. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=377.4s)]
*  If there's evidence that crime has been acted upon, then they need to be charged. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=378.92s)]
*  No one's in the last four years. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=385.56s)]
*  We heard no one's above the law. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=387.12s)]
*  Well, either our members of Congress, either our judges and either our other people. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=388.32s)]
*  You cross the line. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=391.88s)]
*  You violate the law. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  You should be indicted. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=393.8s)]
*  You should be charged. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  So I know you brought up Congresswoman Kibler. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=395.8s)]
*  I said I'd give you time on that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=397.36s)]
*  The reports here that part of the narrative about her has been, quote, contradicted by [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=399.8s)]
*  the video footage and witnesses who are at the scene. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=403.92s)]
*  It was a scuffle. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=407.28s)]
*  That's on video. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=408.48s)]
*  She says it's intimidation. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=409.64s)]
*  I know you have said that she was, quote, unprofessional and people in public life can [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=411.8s)]
*  agree or disagree on who and whichever branch of government are professional. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=416.24s)]
*  But does it concern you that someone who in a co-equal branch is supposed to oversee ICE? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=421.28s)]
*  I'm sure you don't deny her elected authority to do that along with every other member of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=426.0s)]
*  Congress in both parties. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=430.0s)]
*  Does it concern you that now it looks like, according to her lawyers, that the law enforcement [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=430.84s)]
*  agencies are trying to intimidate her out of that enforcement? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=437.32s)]
*  And do you really think the video suggests that she was physically assaulting and battering [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  armed agents because it looks more like a kind of out of control scuffle? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=446.08s)]
*  She claims she was there on oversight. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=450.64s)]
*  We open facilities to oversight every day across this country. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=455.24s)]
*  All you have to do is show up to the facility in a professional manner and request a visit. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=457.84s)]
*  Go through screening and go see it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=464.08s)]
*  We are proud of that facility. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=466.28s)]
*  I want everybody to go look at it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=468.0s)]
*  Maybe all the false narrative will stop about how ICE's detention standards are just so [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=469.8s)]
*  terrible. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=473.88s)]
*  But she put hands, she shoved an officer, she put hands on her officer. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=474.88s)]
*  That's unacceptable. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=479.36s)]
*  These ICE officers, and when you cause a ruckus like that, then that makes that facility unsecure [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=480.76s)]
*  because officers who should be dealing with the prisoners, very serious prisoners, criminals [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=486.84000000000003s)]
*  in that facility, they're dealing with the ruckus outside. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  It makes the facility unsafe. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=495.12s)]
*  It's unsafe for the officers. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=496.52000000000004s)]
*  It is unsafe for the general public. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=497.52000000000004s)]
*  We take the security of those facilities very seriously. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=500.16s)]
*  She knows how to do oversight. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=503.34000000000003s)]
*  Go there and request to look at it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=505.72s)]
*  She bars your way in and regardless of what happens, you don't put hands and you don't [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=509.84s)]
*  shove an ICE officer who's there to protect the facility, protect the public from the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=515.52s)]
*  people in that facility. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=520.68s)]
*  You think DOJ will win that case? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=521.88s)]
*  What I saw, I think she put hands on an officer, she shoved an officer, she needs to pay the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=527.76s)]
*  consequences, absolutely. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=533.0799999999999s)]
*  Okay, well look, they dropped the one. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=534.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, I spent 40 years doing this. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=535.0799999999999s)]
*  No, I know you have experience for talking to me. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=536.4s)]
*  This is the same week we're in Washington, D.C., you know, supporting the men and women [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=537.9599999999999s)]
*  of law enforcement, state, local and federal who gave the ultimate sacrifice. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=545.8s)]
*  It was law enforcement week, police week. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=549.16s)]
*  I attended memorials for Borbacheaux and ICE. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=551.16s)]
*  I buried Borbacheaux agents. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=553.6s)]
*  I buried ICE agents. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=554.88s)]
*  And I met with many families of fallen officers from federal, state and local law enforcement. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=555.88s)]
*  The week we're supposed to celebrate law enforcement, we've got a member of Congress putting her [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=560.12s)]
*  hands on one at a facility. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=563.64s)]
*  Alright, well I... [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=565.4s)]
*  Very unprofessional conduct. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=566.4s)]
*  I said I'd give you time on that. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=567.4s)]
*  And I just said, when the mayor shows up for one reason, he won a press time, he got it. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=568.4s)]
*  Well Mr. Homan, like I said, we heard from the mayor, I'm giving you time on that. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=574.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu4II7b9Vro&t=595.4s)]
