# Rutgers professors take on Trump admin with mutual defense compact
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic)
*  And as the Trump administration's attacks on higher education escalate, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=0.0s)]
*  two Rutgers University professors are leading the charge, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=4.0s)]
*  drafting a one-page mutual defense compact. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=7.0s)]
*  Any school that signs on commits to a unified and vigorous response [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=11.0s)]
*  if any other member university comes under political or legal attack. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=15.0s)]
*  It's been adopted by the Rutgers Faculty Senate and nine more Big Ten schools. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=20.0s)]
*  Major universities in New York and Massachusetts have all passed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=25.0s)]
*  nearly identical resolutions. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=29.0s)]
*  Joining me now are the two Rutgers professors who created this, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=31.0s)]
*  Associate Chemistry Professor David Salas de la Cruz [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=34.0s)]
*  and Psychology Professor Paul Boxer, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=37.0s)]
*  both members of the school's Senate Executive Committee. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=39.0s)]
*  David, where are we that you felt you had to make this step? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=43.0s)]
*  Welcome. First of all, thank you for inviting me to your show. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=48.0s)]
*  You know, I am a professor, and like many of my colleagues, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=51.0s)]
*  this means that I conduct research, I teach, I mentor, and I advise students. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=54.0s)]
*  So I am advising my students on December and January, you got to apply to PhD, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=58.0s)]
*  you have to apply for summer research. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=62.0s)]
*  They all apply for PhD summer research funded by the National Science Foundation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=64.0s)]
*  Everything started happening on February and March. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=69.0s)]
*  This is also when the students start receiving the letters of acceptance or rejection. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=71.0s)]
*  My students start receiving the letter of acceptance. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=76.0s)]
*  They were very excited. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=79.0s)]
*  This is the typical tradition that a student needs to go to PhD or do summer research. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=80.0s)]
*  The next day they receive an email that their funding might be cut [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=85.0s)]
*  and they may have to rescind their offer. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=88.0s)]
*  The student, the undergraduate student that I was applying for summer research [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=90.0s)]
*  received the same letter and they came to my office so worried. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=94.0s)]
*  Professor, I don't know what to do. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=98.0s)]
*  What I do, and I'm like, look, let's be patient. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=100.0s)]
*  This is going to get fixed little by little. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=103.0s)]
*  But at that moment, I felt that the stability of my students was breaking down. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=105.0s)]
*  Not only that, a few weeks later, my junior student received an email [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=111.0s)]
*  that her NIH URISE grant that pay for tuition and pay for stipend was eliminated. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=115.0s)]
*  That means that now her family need to figure out how to pay the last year, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=124.0s)]
*  the senior year, they need to pay for college. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=128.0s)]
*  So I felt that I needed to do something. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=130.0s)]
*  We meet in the Senate every month. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=132.0s)]
*  I start talking with Paul. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=135.0s)]
*  I wanted to learn if this is happening everywhere. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=136.0s)]
*  I started looking for information. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=139.0s)]
*  We even met with some groups of Big Ten and we learned that, yes, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=141.0s)]
*  this is happening everywhere. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=144.0s)]
*  This is where we sit down and we wrote it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=146.0s)]
*  We wanted to make sure that we had a clear idea, some clear pathway [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=148.0s)]
*  of how we can defend ourselves. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=153.0s)]
*  But in reality, what I'm trying to defend is my students. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=155.0s)]
*  You know, Paul, this definitely makes a statement. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=159.0s)]
*  But, and correct me if I'm wrong, I don't think it provides financial backing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=161.0s)]
*  from school administrators for some kind of joint defense fund. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=165.0s)]
*  So tell me where you think this is going next and how it can work to accomplish [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=169.0s)]
*  what you want to do, which is to protect the independence of universities [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=175.0s)]
*  and as Paul said, or as David said, protect the students. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=180.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=185.0s)]
*  And again, thank you for having us and thank you for that question. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=186.0s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=188.0s)]
*  Our original resolution does not stipulate a specific amount of money, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=189.0s)]
*  but we're trying to think more broadly in terms of the ways in which universities [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=192.0s)]
*  can partner and collaborate. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=195.0s)]
*  For example, if a number of universities can come together to engage in [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=197.0s)]
*  collaborative research and legal work, share strategies and tactics for their [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=201.0s)]
*  mutual defense, coordinate legal defense and perhaps joint public relations. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=205.0s)]
*  So part of what we're trying to do here is really offer a way in which [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=209.0s)]
*  universities can come together, I should say university centers, the faculty, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=212.0s)]
*  the staff, the students can come together and put some pressure on [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=215.0s)]
*  administrators and other leadership, folks in leadership to come together [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=219.0s)]
*  and develop ways to work together. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=224.0s)]
*  What are you hearing from your students? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=227.0s)]
*  I hear concerns about the future, some of the kinds of concerns that my colleague [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=231.0s)]
*  here shared in terms of wondering about whether there will be support for their [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=235.0s)]
*  education going forward and also concern about just the overall status and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=239.0s)]
*  standing of our university. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=242.0s)]
*  My students have a lot of pride and a lot of interest in being part of the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=245.0s)]
*  Rutgers community. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=248.0s)]
*  I'm sure students at other universities feel the same way. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=249.0s)]
*  And this is something, you know, in terms of promoting the education of the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=252.0s)]
*  next generation of our labor force, the next generation of our scientists, the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=255.0s)]
*  next generation of innovation, this is something that's really worth holding [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=258.0s)]
*  onto. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=261.0s)]
*  David, when you hear or read that President Trump has said that he's going to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=262.0s)]
*  or wants to get rid of the tax-exempt status for Harvard, what even goes through [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=268.0s)]
*  your mind? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=274.0s)]
*  I mean, what, first of all, wow, what the administrators in that university are [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=276.0s)]
*  thinking now. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=282.0s)]
*  They're working hard. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=283.0s)]
*  They're trying to figure out how to keep the stability of higher education, how [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=285.0s)]
*  to prevent the disruption and the tradition that have long shaped our country in [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=290.0s)]
*  education, because ultimately these administrators know as we, that we are in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=294.0s)]
*  the ground, we're the one running the show, they know that by weakening the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=299.0s)]
*  stability of cultivating the next generation of informed citizens, informed [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=303.0s)]
*  innovators and leaders, at the end of the day, this is going to affect local, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=309.0s)]
*  state and national economies. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=314.0s)]
*  And at the future, this is going to undermine the future economic prosperity. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=316.0s)]
*  So those leaders are working hard to prevent all this as well as the past. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=320.0s)]
*  So, Paul, in our final 30 seconds, if you had Azir, what would you say to the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=325.0s)]
*  President? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=329.0s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=332.0s)]
*  I would try to underscore the importance of why we have higher education in the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=334.0s)]
*  first place and what we're trying to protect here. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=337.0s)]
*  We're trying to protect academic freedom and the kinds of inquiry that we do that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=339.0s)]
*  leads to innovation, that leads to the United States in terms of moving forward, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=342.0s)]
*  making progress on a number of fronts. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=345.0s)]
*  I would talk about preserving the institutional integrity of these great [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=347.0s)]
*  institutions, many of which have been around for dozens, decades or hundreds of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=350.0s)]
*  years, and then trying to promote the scholarly enterprise, the sort of thing [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=355.0s)]
*  that, you know, to coin a phrase that I've heard before, really makes America [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=359.0s)]
*  great. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=363.0s)]
*  Professors David Salas de la Cruz and Paul Boxer, who are putting themselves [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=365.0s)]
*  out there at a challenging time for folks in higher education, thank you. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=369.0s)]
*  Thank you for coming on the show. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=373.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGjDYDKiic&t=389.0s)]
