# ‘Fanning the flames of discord’: CA Lt. Gov. reacts to Trump comparing L.A. protests to wildfires
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s)
*  Joining us now, Lieutenant Governor of California, Eleni Kunalakis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=0.0s)]
*  I just want to ask you, you know, in the last hour, the president again attacked Governor Newsom [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=3.92s)]
*  and compared what's happening in your city to the wildfires that destroyed homes and livelihoods [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=8.48s)]
*  and swathes of the city. Take a listen to the sound. If we didn't get involved, right now, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=13.6s)]
*  Los Angeles would be burning just like it was burning a number of months ago with all the houses [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  that were lost. Los Angeles right now would be on fire and we have it in great shape. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=26.56s)]
*  Madam Lieutenant Governor, what is your reaction to that? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=33.28s)]
*  Well, that doesn't make any sense at all. Cal Fire, which is the largest wildfire fighting force [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=36.08s)]
*  anywhere, got those fires under control. But, you know, it really goes to this question of whether [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  or not California as a state is able to count on the federal government as a partner to work together [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=51.84s)]
*  on combating firefighters and dealing with any emergency that comes along, or if Donald Trump is [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=58.0s)]
*  basically going after our state with intimidation, with wild and inaccurate rhetoric, fanning the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  flames of discord. That is what we are seeing from Donald Trump right now, not collaboration [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=73.84s)]
*  and working together positively. And that is the problem. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=79.76s)]
*  One Trump advisor told one of our colleagues point blank, quote, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  this is what America voted for, period. Is it? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=88.64s)]
*  Well, I think a lot of people have different ideas of why they voted the way that they vote. But the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  bottom line is that we are a nation of laws, that his endorsement of arresting the governor [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  for no legal basis whatsoever. And then, of course, we're sending in the National Guard [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=105.36s)]
*  without consultation with the governor and now the mobilization of Marines against our own [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=110.16s)]
*  very citizens. All of that, I can't imagine that there are many people in this country at all that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=117.44s)]
*  anticipated that those kinds of things would come down. And even just on the most basic level, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=124.16s)]
*  we need ongoing support to deal with the aftermath of those fires. It's estimated that it's cost $130 [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  million to mobilize National Guard guards members who are not needed for this because local [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  government had it under control. But that money would have gone a long way to help with the cleanup [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=145.2s)]
*  process that's underway. And again, showing that resources put toward collaboration between [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=150.96s)]
*  California and the federal government can do so much for people. But Donald Trump's unnecessary [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=158.56s)]
*  deployment, this show of force and strongman kind of strength, is just detrimental to the relationship [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  and a waste of money and not necessary and extremely concerning about what the president's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=172.56s)]
*  intentions are around federal intervention in California and what he's doing to the relationship [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=179.04s)]
*  between our state and the federal government. I want to ask you about those Marines that you [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=186.08s)]
*  mentioned. The video on the left side of our screen is actually President Trump boarding [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=190.96s)]
*  Air Force One to go speak at a military base to U.S. forces. But I want to ask you what calling [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=194.32000000000002s)]
*  up the Marines does to your legal case against the administration? Does it complicate it or does it [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  offer clarity? You know, I think it's separate. The lawsuit that California is filing is against [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  the deployment of the National Guard, which is as a matter of law, there should have been consultation. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=211.52s)]
*  But I want to say something else about the Marines. You know, I'm a former United States [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=220.88s)]
*  ambassador. I went to Afghanistan twice when I served overseas. I have nothing but the greatest [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=224.8s)]
*  respect and gratitude for our Marines. They go in as a lethal fighting force as we, as we, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=230.32000000000002s)]
*  as the United States of America fights our battles around the world, bringing them into a domestic [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=239.11999999999998s)]
*  situation like this, potentially pitting them against U.S. citizens. It is absolutely unacceptable. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=245.2s)]
*  I believe it is an insult to our fighting forces, but also an abuse of presidential power. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  And again, seems to be all part of this effort of Donald Trump to show that he has this heavy hand [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=259.44s)]
*  that he is bringing to his leadership, which is deeply disturbing. Do you think de-escalation [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=266.08s)]
*  both rhetorically and physically is possible right now in Los Angeles? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=274.32s)]
*  I hope so. I will say, you know, I'm going to be the first person to say that de-escalation is [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=280.08s)]
*  always good, that we are not looking for a fight. I certainly don't believe we should be fighting [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=288.08s)]
*  with the federal government. And what I heard just earlier on your show, it sounds like Trump's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=292.8s)]
*  rhetoric is maybe softening a little bit. And again, you know, all of this is so unacceptable. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=299.04s)]
*  But if in fact he is softening his rhetoric, sees that there has been a de-escalation of what [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=306.64s)]
*  is happening on the ground, and that results in his pulling back, that is a good thing and very [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=314.56s)]
*  welcome. All right, Lieutenant Governor, thank you so much for being with us. Thank you so much for having me. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMdfmwMG3s&t=321.2s)]
