# 'He is just trying to please one person': House Dem. slams Rubio's flip-flop on foreign policy
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE)
*  So joining us now is Pennsylvania Congresswoman Madeline Dean, a member of the House Foreign [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=0.0s)]
*  Affairs and Appropriations Committee. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=5.36s)]
*  Thank you for being with us, Congresswoman. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=7.84s)]
*  So talk about when Secretary Rubio came before your committee this week. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=9.88s)]
*  How did he justify such huge cuts to the State Department's budget? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=14.82s)]
*  He didn't justify it at all. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  And those two clips showed you what has happened to Marco Rubio. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=22.48s)]
*  What happens to anybody who in their previous life was clear-eyed about whether Putin is [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=26.42s)]
*  a war criminal, when he stole tens of thousands of children from Ukraine, invaded a sovereign [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=31.900000000000002s)]
*  nation? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=38.58s)]
*  Marco Rubio was very clear-eyed about what that meant. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=39.94s)]
*  But when you are a courtier to Donald Trump, you speak in passive expression, you can't [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=43.14s)]
*  say things clearly. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=48.22s)]
*  And for the top diplomat, for the Secretary of State, not to mention national security [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=51.46s)]
*  advisor, archivist, and whatever else, how he's wearing, not to be clear-eyed on these [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=56.7s)]
*  things is staggering to me. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=62.5s)]
*  You saw also how he, when he was a senator, was very clear-eyed that cutting off foreign [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=65.06s)]
*  aid didn't make a lot of sense because foreign aid, as he said then, had to do with our own [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=72.26s)]
*  national security interests. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=78.18s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=79.58s)]
*  His fourth hat was USAID. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=80.7s)]
*  How could I forget? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=81.7s)]
*  That was one of his original hats. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=82.7s)]
*  And he also said that won't help balance the budget. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=87.14s)]
*  And yet, wearing his USAID hat and slashing USAID, he sat there and said, no one will [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=90.46s)]
*  be hurt, no one will die. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=98.38s)]
*  He was clear-eyed before, and now it's very muddled. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=100.84s)]
*  Everything is in passive voice because he is just trying to please one person. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=104.3s)]
*  Hey, Congresswoman, let me play you another soundbite from Secretary acting all the jobs, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=109.05999999999999s)]
*  Marco Rubio, on Wednesday following the Supreme Court's decision on deportations. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=116.97999999999999s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=122.41999999999999s)]
*  It says— [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=123.41999999999999s)]
*  Do you believe that Trump has to follow the Supreme Court 9-0 unanimous decision? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=124.41999999999999s)]
*  Within the context of separation of powers. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=130.45999999999998s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=132.26s)]
*  No court can tell me how to conduct foreign policy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=133.26s)]
*  They can't tell me what I have to say to a president of another country, nor do I need [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=134.98s)]
*  to tell them what I told the president of another country because I can't conduct foreign policy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=137.9s)]
*  I'm just asking you, do you believe that Trump's decision has to follow the unanimous [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=141.10000000000002s)]
*  Supreme Court decision? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=145.26000000000002s)]
*  I believe we are following it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=146.26000000000002s)]
*  I mean, Congresswoman, no court can tell me how to conduct foreign policy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=149.26000000000002s)]
*  Open defiance of the Supreme Court of the United States. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=154.26000000000002s)]
*  Remember, that's a simple yes or no answer. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=157.74s)]
*  The answer is you have to follow the Supreme Court. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=162.38000000000002s)]
*  We are co-equal branches. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=166.22s)]
*  Secretary Rubio is a very smart man. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=167.98s)]
*  He knows that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=170.1s)]
*  I want to just pivot, if you don't mind, to say what I was hoping to get from the secretary. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=171.38s)]
*  He has an important role to play in peacemaking, to ending suffering. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=177.42s)]
*  And so I mentioned to him the fact that we both had the privilege of last Sunday being [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=182.1s)]
*  at the installation of Pope Leo. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=187.2s)]
*  I wanted to talk to him about the suffering in Gaza. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=189.78s)]
*  I wanted to talk to him about the return of the 58 hostages living and deceased. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=192.82s)]
*  He is the top diplomat. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=199.1s)]
*  He should be seeking to an end to the suffering, to getting aid in. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=200.7s)]
*  Children are starving in Gaza right now. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  We know it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=208.38s)]
*  And yet we have Mr. Netanyahu who has blocked aid for 60, 70 days now. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=209.38s)]
*  And to me, said to my face, no one is going without. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  Where is Mr. Rubio on this? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=218.5s)]
*  Why hasn't he said, we will be a champion for the families of those hostages? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=220.4s)]
*  We need to get them home first. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=225.62s)]
*  We need to make sure Putin lives up, excuse me for confusing it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=227.82s)]
*  Forgive me, really. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=234.18s)]
*  Mr. Netanyahu lives up to getting aid. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=235.56s)]
*  I'm just dismayed at Mr. Rubio. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  Maybe it is because he has too many hats on, but he has some important roles to play around [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=242.0s)]
*  the world toward peacemaking. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=246.3s)]
*  And by equivocating on whether or not Putin is a war criminal or whether or not aid is [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=248.26s)]
*  getting into Gaza is not doing his job. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=252.82s)]
*  I mean, you would need to have a boss who has kind of like a very easy policy prescription [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=255.78s)]
*  to follow, right, for you to be able to operate in that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=261.38s)]
*  That's when I talk to folks in the White House and around the administration. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=264.58s)]
*  The confusion at the top leads to confusion at the bottom. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=267.58s)]
*  But I think, you know, this hardly an excuse for equivocating on whether or not Putin is [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=270.58s)]
*  a war criminal when he was just recently saying that getting in Rex Tillerson's face [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=275.06s)]
*  about it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=280.18s)]
*  I do want to take a little bit of a turn to education because you had the education secretary [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=281.18s)]
*  on Wednesday. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=287.82s)]
*  And I want to play with you, talk to her about it, and then talk about it on the other side. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=288.82s)]
*  Why are you in this job at all? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=295.02s)]
*  If you don't have a dedication to the future of our children, why are you in this job? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=297.72s)]
*  I, too, am a mother and a grandmother, and I want the best for my family going forward. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=303.06s)]
*  Vouchers. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=309.06s)]
*  For my grandchildren, for my great-grandchildren, and the hope to leave a legacy that we have [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=310.06s)]
*  established best practices for education that all the states can use. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=314.58000000000004s)]
*  Madam Secretary, the legacy you will be leaving is that I shut down the Department of Education. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=318.22s)]
*  How we educate our children determines not just their future, but our own. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=323.98s)]
*  But the department— [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=328.86s)]
*  I think it's a sad legacy you will leave. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=329.86s)]
*  I yield back. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=330.86s)]
*  Congresswoman, that's taking a mess. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=333.86s)]
*  One of the things that I think people find so troubling is she was put in that position [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=338.1s)]
*  to get rid of that department. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=343.8s)]
*  Yet, you see them going against Harvard and trying to dilly-dally in what they are doing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=345.3s)]
*  and how they operate and telling other universities how they should be able to teach and what [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=350.56s)]
*  they should be able to teach to their school and their students, what kind of students [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=354.78000000000003s)]
*  they're allowed to have, whether they're international or not. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=359.26s)]
*  As someone who clearly cares about the education of the people in this country, the kids of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=363.26s)]
*  this country, where are we going? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=367.62s)]
*  What can people do to stop some of this? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=370.9s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=372.86s)]
*  We're going to a very dark place. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=374.34000000000003s)]
*  Number one, she's completely unqualified to be the Secretary of Education. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=376.26s)]
*  Read her testimony. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=382.1s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=383.1s)]
*  Her first paragraph mirrors the first sentence of Project 2025, page 319, where it says, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=384.1s)]
*  We want to shutter the Department of Education. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=392.9s)]
*  That's her final mission, she calls it, to shutter the place. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=395.53999999999996s)]
*  And when she talks about her own children and grandchildren, I don't think we have to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=400.02s)]
*  worry about them getting their education. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=405.9s)]
*  Her job is to worry about every other child, to make sure every child gets an adequate [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=408.14s)]
*  and, I say, excellent education, regardless of the color of their skin, regardless of [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=413.94s)]
*  or the economic status of their parents. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=420.21999999999997s)]
*  So she was very disingenuous, completely unqualified. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=423.53999999999996s)]
*  And who in God's name thinks it's a good idea, if you think we're not educating our kids [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  well enough? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=431.46s)]
*  I told her it's a logic fallacy. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=432.46s)]
*  Let's just do less. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=434.53999999999996s)]
*  But I said, you know, this is awfully Orwellian. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=436.78s)]
*  It's 1984. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=439.26s)]
*  We actually don't want an educated electorate. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=440.9s)]
*  That's what the Trump administration is saying. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=443.29999999999995s)]
*  But she doesn't get that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=445.94s)]
*  It's also no accident, right? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=448.90000000000003s)]
*  Because like you said, it's in Project 2025, right? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=450.14s)]
*  This is kind of exactly how they want to do. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=452.78000000000003s)]
*  And if what you want to do is in Project 2025, then I guess maybe Donald Trump and a lot [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=455.34000000000003s)]
*  of the folks that think she should be in that job do think she's qualified to get rid of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=460.42s)]
*  the Department of Education. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=463.58000000000004s)]
*  You know, Eugene, you bring up a great point. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=464.58000000000004s)]
*  And that's what this week was a really dark week for this country. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=468.62s)]
*  And what happened, whether it was talking to an unfit secretary of education, talking [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=472.94s)]
*  to an equivocating national security adviser slash secretary of state, and then you saw [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=479.21999999999997s)]
*  the two in the dark of nights holding hearings, markups on passing the big ugly budget of [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=486.34s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=494.65999999999997s)]
*  This was a very dark moment. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=495.78s)]
*  I don't want anybody to not recognize that the lying that was going on, this wasn't just [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=497.82s)]
*  people fighting for their version of a budget. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=505.21999999999997s)]
*  The Republican courtiers to Donald Trump spent day after day in syrupy lie after syrupy lie [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=507.9s)]
*  about, oh, we're not going to touch Medicaid. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=514.98s)]
*  No, you're going to throw as many as 13.7 million people off their health care. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=517.5s)]
*  Oh, we're not going to touch SNAP or nutrition. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=523.3s)]
*  You're going to have the largest cut to nutrition benefits. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=526.02s)]
*  Kids will go hungrier in this country. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=530.06s)]
*  What a grotesque statement. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=533.26s)]
*  And of course, they never want to tell you who it's in service to. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=535.1s)]
*  It's in service to blowing up the deficit at the expense, at the privilege of the wealthiest [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=538.66s)]
*  1% getting a tax break. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=544.86s)]
*  It was a very dark set of days this week. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=546.9s)]
*  And I really want people to pay attention to the ease with which Republican leadership [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=550.5s)]
*  lies. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2_Zw5_IPE&t=555.38s)]
