# ‘War on the rule of law’: Nicolle Wallace on the intentional chaos unleashed by Trump in Los Angeles
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg)
*  We are in the midst of a uniquely alarming moment, right? A moment where the president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=0.0s)]
*  of the United States sees an unfolding situation as a political opportunity, one for him to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=6.8s)]
*  advance his goal of strengthening and fortifying his grip on power, because what's happening in [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=13.92s)]
*  Los Angeles is not just about immigration. We all know that. President Barack Obama carried out more [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=19.36s)]
*  deportations in his eight years in any administration at a pace quicker than even [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=25.52s)]
*  Donald Trump's first term. Do you remember ICE raids in the middle of cities by men wearing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=30.56s)]
*  paramilitary gear and then Obama sending in the National Guard over the objections of governors? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Neither do I, because that never happened. Do you know why it never happened? It never [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=43.6s)]
*  happened because carrying out a legal and orderly, ineffective immigration policy [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=49.76s)]
*  isn't at all what Trump is doing. Trump seems from the outside to be producing theater, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=56.56s)]
*  and maybe it's to distract. Maybe it's to distract us from talking about Elon Musk's tweet with his [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=62.64s)]
*  unsubstantiated allegations about Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, something we on the outside [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=69.68s)]
*  have seen no proof of. Maybe it's to distract from his plunging approval ratings on the economy, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=75.76s)]
*  trade, inflation, even immigration. Maybe he's trying to distract us from covering his stalled [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=82.16000000000001s)]
*  agenda in Congress. That's actually what the big fight with Elon Musk started over. Maybe he wants [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=88.56s)]
*  to distract us from covering the debacle of a trade war he started, or the debacle of 90 deals [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=95.44s)]
*  in 90 days to which there is 0.5, like 0.5 deals, 0.5. Former ICE official Jason Hauser tells the New [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=103.6s)]
*  York Times this, quote, right now the government is burning thousands of federal law enforcement [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=114.16s)]
*  hours on operations that privilege political objectives over public safety, attacking [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=118.64s)]
*  constitutional protections like due process and free speech as they do. If this administration [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  does not correct course, it will lock the country into a future of weaker enforcement, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=129.76s)]
*  lowered trust in public safety officials, and greater risk to Americans' collective safety. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=134.88s)]
*  Hauser will join our program in the next block. He wrote that two months ago, before Donald Trump's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=140.56s)]
*  Rubicon Crossing moment this weekend. Donald Trump's decision to federalize and deploy the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=147.44s)]
*  National Guard over the objections of California's Governor Gavin Newsom with 500 Marines on standby [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=154.64s)]
*  amid protests against raids by ICE is something the likes of which we haven't seen in the United [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=163.04s)]
*  States of America since the year 1965. The last American president to deploy the National Guard [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  without a request from the state's governor was Lyndon B. Johnson, and he did it in that instance [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=176.0s)]
*  to protect civil rights protesters in Alabama. California's Governor Gavin Newsom had this to say [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=181.44s)]
*  about this move from Donald Trump. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=188.64s)]
*  I've worked with the National Guard. We've deployed the National Guard. We did three plus thousand [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=192.16s)]
*  folks have been doing logistics work and fire recovery work and they're fighting the fires, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=196.32s)]
*  the rattlesnake teams. We did the same back in George Floyd. We had no problem working [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=200.56s)]
*  collaboratively in a mutual aid system with local law enforcement, but there's a protocol, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=205.28s)]
*  there's a process. He didn't care about that. And the worst part, he completely lied. He said in a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=209.12s)]
*  tweet that everything's now safe, everything's fine. Is that the case, Mr. Trump? He said because he [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=214.0s)]
*  deployed the National Guard. The Guard hadn't even been deployed when he said this. It's Orwellian. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=220.24s)]
*  Simply lying to people. Unconstitutional, illegal act. His mess. We're trying to clean it up. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=225.52s)]
*  Today, the state of California sued the Trump administration over the deployment of the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  National Guard. He and other officials insist that the deployment has only made a volatile [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=238.56s)]
*  situation worse, something that they could have handled on their own. The New York Times reports [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=243.28s)]
*  this about the situation on the ground before Trump sends in the National Guard. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=248.48s)]
*  Although some demonstrations have been unruly, local authorities in Los Angeles County did not [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=254.96s)]
*  indicate during the day that they needed federal assistance. The reality on the ground did not and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=260.0s)]
*  does not matter to the Trump administration. The New York Times reports this as well. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=266.16s)]
*  On social media, Trump, his aides and allies have sought to frame the demonstrations against [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  immigration officials on their own terms. They have shared images and videos of the most violent [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  episodes, focusing particularly on examples of protesters lashing out at federal agents, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=282.0s)]
*  even as many remained peaceful. At the White House this morning, Trump called the protesters, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=287.44000000000005s)]
*  quote, insurrectionists. In short, he is looking for ammo to justify invoking the Insurrection [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=292.72s)]
*  Act and moving closer to something he has talked about doing for a long time, using the military [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=300.72s)]
*  against the, quote, enemy within. Here's what his former chief of staff, John Kelly, had to say in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=306.0s)]
*  terms of a warning about this moment. And I think this issue of using the military [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=311.6s)]
*  to go after American citizens is one of those things I think [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  is a very, very bad thing. Even to say it for political purposes to get elected, I think it's a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=325.52s)]
*  very, very bad thing, let alone actually doing it. When I was in the White House, for that matter, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  DHS, I was, you know, originally conversation would be, you know, Mr. President, that's outside [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=336.48s)]
*  your authority or, you know, that's a routine use. You really don't want to do that inside [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=346.4s)]
*  the United States. But now that he's talking about it as I'm going to do it is, again, it's disturbing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=353.92s)]
*  Again, that's a warning given by General John Kelly ahead of last November's election about [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=363.2s)]
*  what Trump sought to do the first time that he, Kelly and others, stopped him from doing [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=367.84s)]
*  and why, the impact it would have on the military. But Donald Trump gave the game away [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  when he was asked on Saturday about sending in troops. Take a listen. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=378.96s)]
*  We're going to have, quote, troops everywhere. They're going to be everywhere. Active duty troops. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  Trump promises to bring what's happening in Los Angeles right now to, Trump's word, quote, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=403.12s)]
*  we're going to have troops everywhere, to everywhere. Today, in the round, a fourth day of protests [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=409.84s)]
*  is underway right now. In the wake of the ICE raids across the city, one of those raids took [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=415.68s)]
*  place at a Home Depot parking lot. The Washington Post reports this about that raid, quote, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=421.52s)]
*  six migrants who said they were present recounted how federal immigration authorities began [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=425.52s)]
*  handcuffing anyone they could grab in one of several raids in the city that would spark a [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=430.24s)]
*  wave of unrest and leave immigrant workers of all stripes jolted. One migrant saying this, quote, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=434.72s)]
*  they were just grabbing people. They didn't ask questions. They didn't know if any of us were in [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=440.0s)]
*  any kind of immigration process. The nation's second largest city, a flashpoint today in both [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  Trump's immigration crackdown and his war on the rule of law. It's where we begin today with NBC's [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=452.24s)]
*  Jacob Sobov, who is at the site of one of the ICE raids that took place on Friday that sparked [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=457.6s)]
*  the initial protest. Can you do one thing before you brilliantly take us into this moment? Can you [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=462.56s)]
*  just rewind the tape a little bit and reset me on what has happened there over the weekend? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=467.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, of course, Nicole. And your introduction was really wonderful because I think what it sets up [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=475.36s)]
*  so perfectly is how unusual and how unprecedented the size and the scale and the scope of the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  immigration enforcement operations that took place in Los Angeles, starting with right here [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=486.8s)]
*  at this Home Depot in Cypress Park at seven o'clock, seven fifteen, seven thirty on Friday morning, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  war and why they led to those protests. The big picture is Los Angeles is a so-called [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=497.52000000000004s)]
*  majority minority city in a majority minority state. There are more people of color that live [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  in Los Angeles than white people at this point, and many of those people are undocumented. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=508.72s)]
*  By some counts, 10 percent of the population of L.A. County, one of the largest counties, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=513.84s)]
*  the largest county by population in the United States, is undocumented, maybe as many as a million [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=518.24s)]
*  people. Those people are our neighbors, our co-workers, our classmates, our friends, our [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=522.64s)]
*  parishioners, fellow parishioners in churches. They are part of the fabric of the city of Los [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=529.44s)]
*  Angeles and not in the last many decades under Democratic nor Republican presidents. Despite the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=534.08s)]
*  fact that you had presidents with big deportation programs, Democratic and Republican, as you have [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=540.56s)]
*  so often reported, have we seen the type of immigration enforcement we saw play out [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=545.5999999999999s)]
*  on the streets of Los Angeles on Friday? And that struck fear into the heart of not just the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  undocumented community here, but of many U.S. citizen family members of undocumented people [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  and many U.S. citizens who know those people, because that is removing people from this community [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  who have been here, if not their entire life, virtually their entire lives. There are so many [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=569.84s)]
*  mixed status families that live in Los Angeles that might have an undocumented parent or relative [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=575.2s)]
*  and U.S. citizen child or cousin who, we've talked about this before, the family separation policy of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=581.0400000000001s)]
*  the first Trump administration in 2018 was a deliberate ripping apart of parents and children [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=589.0400000000001s)]
*  at the border to separate those families and inflict pain on those families. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=593.84s)]
*  But when I say mass deportation is family separation, when I say those signs that were held up [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=598.96s)]
*  on the floor of the Republican convention, as I talked to you from the floor of that convention, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=604.1600000000001s)]
*  was a sign of what was to come and why that is also a form of family separation. It is family [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=609.12s)]
*  separation in the interior. It's taking parents away from their children, not at the border and [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=613.9200000000001s)]
*  not in detention centers, but at a Home Depot on the street corner or outside of a school [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=618.72s)]
*  or at a workplace in the fashion district where they might be working in a factory. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  It's a different form of family separation and it's exactly the intent of this administration [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=631.2s)]
*  modeled after Nicole Dwight D. Eisenhower's 1954 operation with the name So Racist. I'm not going [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=635.36s)]
*  to say it here to you right now, but it resulted in a million Mexicans and some Mexican Americans [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=641.28s)]
*  being sent to Mexico in the wake of the Bracero program coming here legally in the 1950s. That's [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=647.5999999999999s)]
*  what the Trump administration is modeling this program after. That's their stated goal. They've [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=653.68s)]
*  talked about it. And so now we're seeing it effectuated on the streets of the largest county [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  in America, second largest city in America, with the largest undocumented population in America, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BynOd6B7NFg&t=664.16s)]
