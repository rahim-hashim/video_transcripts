# Bulwark editor: Musk may ‘look back with regret’ on time in the White House
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg)
*  We begin with the final day on the job in the Trump administration for Elon Musk [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=0.0s)]
*  The billionaire who once referred to himself as the first buddy got an Oval Office sendoff yesterday that didn't sound very final [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=4.84s)]
*  Elon's really not leaving he's gonna be back and forth. I think I have a feeling it's it's his baby [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=14.72s)]
*  and I think he's gonna be doing a lot of things I expect to remain a friend and an advisor and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=20.04s)]
*  Certainly if there's anything the president wants me to do I'm at the present service [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=27.08s)]
*  Friend and advisor Musk insisted that the work of Doge the Department of Government Efficiency [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=32.44s)]
*  Would continue even with him out of the picture [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=38.48s)]
*  But his White House exit was overshadowed by bombshell reporting from the New York Times that raised questions about his behavior during the campaign [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  Last year the Times reported that as Musk became one of Donald Trump's allies [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  He was also using drugs far more intensely than previously known according to people familiar with his activities [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=53.64s)]
*  NBC News has not independently verified the reporting and the Times notes [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=59.92s)]
*  It's not clear whether Musk's alleged drug use continued while he was working with Doge quote [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=64.44s)]
*  Mr. Musk's drug consumption went well beyond occasional use [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  He told people he was taking so much ketamine a powerful anesthetic that it was affecting his bladder a known effect of chronic use [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=73.56s)]
*  He took ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms and he traveled with a daily medication box that held about [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=81.44s)]
*  20 pills including ones with the markings of the stimulant Adderall according to a photo of the box and people who have seen it [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Musk had been using ketamine often sometimes daily and mixing it with other drugs according to people familiar with his consumption [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  The line between medical use and recreation was blurry [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=104.32s)]
*  Troubling some people close to him now Musk has previously acknowledged being [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=108.28s)]
*  Prescribed ketamine to address his mental health late last night as he returned from Pennsylvania President Trump was asked about the report [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=112.92s)]
*  Were you aware of Elon Musk's regular drug use? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=121.4s)]
*  No, I wasn't I think he's fantastic. I think Elon is a fantastic guy and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=125.0s)]
*  And [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=130.84s)]
*  By these reports that trouble by anything with Elon [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  I think he's fantastic did a great job and you know Doge continues and by the time it's finished [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=135.0s)]
*  We'll have numbers that'll knock the stocks off. It's gonna be he did a fantastic job and he didn't need it [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=140.56s)]
*  He didn't need to do it [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=147.68s)]
*  Not really answering the question there but joining us now Eugene Robertson the OG Eugene [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  An MSNBC political analyst and Sam Stein managing editor for the bullwork and an MSNBC contributor also the OG Sam Stein [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=155.12s)]
*  You know Eugene I want to I want to start with you because you know [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=167.16s)]
*  There's a question to whether or not he's actually distancing himself because his businesses are bad [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=171.12s)]
*  Oh going, you know, there's been that impact. He obviously has done being a special government employee, but he's not going anywhere [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=176.52s)]
*  So what was the impact of Elon Musk's 130 days as a special government employee? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=182.5s)]
*  You know chaos ruin destruction [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=188.02s)]
*  There's a lot of impact, you know [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=191.42s)]
*  Here in the Washington area. That's a huge impact [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=194.74s)]
*  I talked to my neighbors and and and you know who you work for the government or used to work for the government or had [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=197.58s)]
*  government contact or whatever so [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=204.58s)]
*  It was a very huge impact on [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=207.58s)]
*  The administration the bureaucracy of the federal government [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=210.86s)]
*  To know a [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=215.82000000000002s)]
*  Parent end in a lot of ways to know good end in a lot of ways [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=218.06s)]
*  But he definitely you know came in and he broke things [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=222.34s)]
*  And moved fast and he didn't build anything reasonable in their wake [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=227.5s)]
*  But he broke things [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  One [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=237.3s)]
*  Unrivalable one concrete accomplishment that Doge has that Elon can lay claim to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=238.76s)]
*  That made government more efficient and effective because I think there was a lot of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=244.76s)]
*  Liway at the very beginning Americans approved of him coming in they you know [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=250.04s)]
*  Obviously he has a great record as an entrepreneur and engineer and he had an opportunity [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  But did he squander the moment? I'm sure there's something technical or clerical [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  That Doge will have done in the end, you know, maybe it's streamlining some [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=266.36s)]
*  Sort of internal communication system at the VA or you know figuring something out that it probably you know antiquated [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=271.2s)]
*  IT that really didn't need updating in which Doge probably would have been really good at [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=277.76s)]
*  but in the end that's incredibly overshadowed by [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=282.32s)]
*  The damage that he left in his wake and Eugene's right [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=285.6s)]
*  It's measured in the terms of people who were fired from their jobs in and around this town government services that will be disrupted [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=289.12s)]
*  But I can't get over [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=295.6s)]
*  I think it was Bill Gates might have been someone else saying essentially what for me is the most memorable part of it [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  Which is that the world's richest man spent a couple weeks [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=302.58000000000004s)]
*  Destroying the lives of the world's poorest children and what happened to USA which was his first real target [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=305.12s)]
*  We will see the ramifications of that decades and we have seen a real retrenchment in global leadership [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=312.0s)]
*  From the US and also in terms of humanitarian aid that we offer people and that will result in [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=319.36s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world and I don't think we should sugarcoat that at all deaths and increasing [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=325.36s)]
*  Influence by China, which is filling [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=332.32000000000005s)]
*  You know the vacuum in some places the one thing you're absolutely right. So one thing does could have done [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  They could have fixed the federal government's IT [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=340.32000000000005s)]
*  For I was really hoping for that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=344.48s)]
*  That needed to be done still needs to be done and they could they would have been good at that but [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=349.08000000000004s)]
*  They didn't get much attention about Doge but the person they put at the VA who came in there he came from some sort of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  Tech, I know [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=363.3s)]
*  Private sector background and he was expecting to go in there and find this horrendous [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=364.36s)]
*  bureaucracy and he what he found out was that is actually operating fairly efficiently, but what it needed was a [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=368.24s)]
*  Sprucing up of the IT and some of the other HR components and that's what they're doing and and you know [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=373.44s)]
*  The irony was they came in initially and tried to fire everybody had to rehire people [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=379.08s)]
*  It was chaotic and so this is what Doge should have focused on. I mean one thing one thing [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=382.56s)]
*  IT that they did do was Hoover up all the personal information [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=388.52s)]
*  Yeah of millions of Americans that Eugene how much mr. Robinson? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=392.88s)]
*  There's no confusion [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=398.44s)]
*  Robinson [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=400.44s)]
*  So he's leaving [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=402.64s)]
*  Musk Musk is leaving at the appointed time [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=404.68s)]
*  But how much of his leaving do you think is also related to the? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=407.88s)]
*  Reputational damage that has been done to his companies particularly Tesla not just here in the United States [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=413.24s)]
*  But around around the world. I think I think that's massively involved in his in his decision to very publicly [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=420.08s)]
*  Say I'm stepping away. I'm going back to my companies and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=427.79999999999995s)]
*  Look, this is a huge challenge. I mean Tesla has taken an enormous hit and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=432.59999999999997s)]
*  and one thing that will linger is [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=437.96s)]
*  It used to be like cool and and a good thing people felt good about owning a Tesla [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=441.12s)]
*  I [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=447.84s)]
*  You know, I have neighbors and friends who have testis. They don't feel good about owning a Tesla anymore [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=449.35999999999996s)]
*  Another one so do any of them have that sort of aliens to the cyber briefly tank [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=455.72s)]
*  I don't know anybody who has [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=463.08000000000004s)]
*  This cyber truck [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=466.88000000000005s)]
*  The politics 101 of this of Elon Musk could have come in and tried to do something [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=469.6s)]
*  Very simple that made sense and just showcase it rather than just carnage. He missed that moment [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=475.8s)]
*  I think now he is starting to get the politics of it a little more [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=482.16s)]
*  Let's hear what he said on CBS this morning because he is starting to try to distance himself from Trump as he needs to [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=485.04s)]
*  regain his business footing [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=491.04s)]
*  You know, it's not like I agree with everything [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=494.56s)]
*  The administration does it's difficult for me to bring that up in an interview because then it creates a bone of contention [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  So then I'm a little stuck in a bind where I'm like, well, I [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=503.24s)]
*  Don't want to you know speak up against the administration, but I don't want to [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=507.56s)]
*  I also don't want to take responsibility for everything the administration is doing [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=513.16s)]
*  What it sounds like to me is one he doesn't want to go a file of Donald Trump [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=521.52s)]
*  But also this is a man who has realized [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=526.0799999999999s)]
*  That it is often better to be an outside advisor and person who can call the president [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=528.28s)]
*  Than someone who's like actually working with him and doing the work. Yeah [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=532.8399999999999s)]
*  I [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=536.88s)]
*  Think you probably will look back in the decision to join the administration with some regret obviously [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=538.36s)]
*  But it was like it was very evident from the get-go [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=546.24s)]
*  I mean remember early on they had that fight over visas where he was on the wrong side and then Trump had to come [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=548.4399999999999s)]
*  Over to his side and then you know [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=552.84s)]
*  clearly he was on [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=554.32s)]
*  At odds with him on tariffs because there was fights between the cabinet officials and that and then on Doge there was cabinet official fights [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=555.64s)]
*  with Secretary Duffy and Rubio on him [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=562.16s)]
*  Remember Elon Musk is a foreigner who came over here [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=565.04s)]
*  I believe on a foreign on a student visa and now they are currently going after student visa [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhrcTRa26Xg&t=567.92s)]
