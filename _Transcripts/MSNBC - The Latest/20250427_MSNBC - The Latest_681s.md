# AG Nessel: Trump vendetta against DEI in schools is ‘not based in fact’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI)
*  will mark 100 days in office with an event in Michigan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=0.0s)]
*  White House officials say the event [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=4.16s)]
*  will focus on what they call a monumental first 100 days. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=5.8s)]
*  Well, you're not too wrong about that, thanks in part [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=10.44s)]
*  to Trump's flurry of executive orders. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=14.08s)]
*  But those orders have been met with dozens [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=16.2s)]
*  of legal challenges from Democrat-led states, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=18.78s)]
*  including Michigan. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=22.44s)]
*  Just on Friday, Michigan joined 18 other states [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=23.64s)]
*  in suing the Trump administration over its threat [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=26.64s)]
*  to withhold funding from districts [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=29.68s)]
*  with certain diversity programs in their public schools. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=31.44s)]
*  Joining us now to talk about that, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=35.08s)]
*  Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=36.76s)]
*  General Nessel, so good to have you at the table. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=39.24s)]
*  In that lawsuit, you note that Trump's directives put more [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=41.2s)]
*  than $18.7 billion of federal funding for education at risk. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  States that the Trump administration has, quote, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=47.72s)]
*  repeatedly failed to define the conduct that they seek [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=49.56s)]
*  to punish or prohibit or what constitutes illegal DEI. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=52.64s)]
*  Talk me through this lawsuit. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=56.96s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's the same problem [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=58.56s)]
*  that we see on a lot of these executive orders [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=60.28s)]
*  that have been drafted by the Trump administration, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  signed by President Trump. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=66.72s)]
*  There's seemingly no rhyme or reason. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=68.8s)]
*  There's certainly no legal definition. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=71.12s)]
*  Many of them, to me, sound as though they've been drafted [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=73.44s)]
*  by a psychotic toddler. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  I mean, these are not the kinds of words or language [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=78.2s)]
*  that we normally see written in a legal document. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=80.92s)]
*  And there's no way, even if one wanted to comply, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  even if it was legal and it did not violate state law [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=86.92s)]
*  and federal law to comply, there's really no way to know [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=90.24s)]
*  if you're in compliance or not. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  And to talk about defunding our schools in this manner, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=95.92s)]
*  knowing that there's really nothing that you're ever [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=99.52s)]
*  gonna be able to do correctly. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=100.8s)]
*  And I look at things like Columbia University [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  and their attempts at appeasement, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=105.96s)]
*  or I look at the law firms that signed these agreements [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=109.32s)]
*  saying, okay, we're gonna do what you want, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  and that way we'll be in the clear, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=115.68s)]
*  we're not gonna be punished. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=117.4s)]
*  There is no really getting out of it, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=118.68s)]
*  because when you, as I guess Winston Churchill used to say, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=120.32s)]
*  when you feed the crocodile hoping [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=124.6s)]
*  that you'll get eaten last, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=126.88s)]
*  you're still getting eaten eventually. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=128.72s)]
*  I mean, there's no way to ensure that you are eventually [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=130.28s)]
*  not going to be punished by this administration, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=136.16s)]
*  because nothing will ever be good enough for them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=138.24s)]
*  That is so true. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=141.2s)]
*  I just, it helped me understand how this administration [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=144.0s)]
*  has been so successful at claiming something is illegal [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=150.56s)]
*  that is not written into any law in the country, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  and that's diversity, equity, and inclusion as a thing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  And so now we find ourselves, to your point, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  witnessing how that's been sort of the cudgel [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  to use against other institutions, universities, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=170.68s)]
*  now our museums here in the nation's capital [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=174.6s)]
*  and around the country. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=177.2s)]
*  What, from a legal standpoint, how do you go in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=179.16s)]
*  and make the case that the administration [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=183.76s)]
*  is sort of making up law and giving weight to something [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=186.96s)]
*  that doesn't exist in the form that they claim it does [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=191.16s)]
*  as a thing written down, well, on this paragraph, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=195.68s)]
*  this DEI paragraph, the law says this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  That's not the case here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=201.96s)]
*  It's an idea, it's something that we aspire to diversity. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  We are desirous of some level of inclusion and equity. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  How do we now find ourselves where that's illegal? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=211.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's just years of disinformation, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=216.12s)]
*  misinformation, much of it, I think, coming from social media. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  Nothing that's based in fact, right, I mean, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=224.28s)]
*  is teaching the Civil War illegal? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=227.32s)]
*  DEI is teaching about Jim Crow [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=230.4s)]
*  or Brown v. Board of Education, is that illegal DEI? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=232.84s)]
*  Clearly it's not, you know, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=235.72s)]
*  but it's just this long time effort, I guess, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=237.76s)]
*  to poison people against, honestly, just learning the truth. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=240.52s)]
*  And that's why in the very beginning, you know, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=244.56s)]
*  one of the executive orders that was drafted [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=246.68s)]
*  really was an effort to go after teachers [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=249.36s)]
*  and to threaten them with prosecution [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=253.12s)]
*  for what they called radical indoctrination. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=255.84s)]
*  And I right away put something out [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=260.08s)]
*  to the teachers of the state of Michigan [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=262.12s)]
*  and just said, this is ridiculous. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=264.36s)]
*  You don't make, first of all, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=266.88s)]
*  you make law through an executive order. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=267.92s)]
*  That's not how you create a criminal statute. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=270.64s)]
*  You still have to involve something called Congress [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=273.0s)]
*  for federal laws. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  You would need a state legislature [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=277.52s)]
*  and a governor for a state law. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  But it's the threat, right? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=281.92s)]
*  It's the threat that really scares people [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=283.56s)]
*  and gets whether it's teachers, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=287.04s)]
*  whether it's people in universities, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=289.08s)]
*  whether it's recipients of all kinds of different grants [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=291.88s)]
*  at colleges, just scared out of their mind [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=295.68s)]
*  and they don't know what to do [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=298.36s)]
*  because they don't know what the punishment is gonna be. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=300.16s)]
*  And that's why I think it's so important [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=302.52s)]
*  that as state AGs that we are fighting back, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=304.32s)]
*  not just on behalf of the states that we represent, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=307.12s)]
*  but on behalf of the people who live in the states [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=310.84s)]
*  that we represent so that they know [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=313.67999999999995s)]
*  these are illegal orders. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=317.08s)]
*  The courts have in large part agreed with us. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I think it is very important [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=320.64s)]
*  that the state attorney generals have been pushing back [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  because when the president sits in a meeting and says, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=324.76s)]
*  well, we are the law, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=328.44s)]
*  I think the attorney general's pushing back underscoring, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=330.0s)]
*  no, sir, you are not the law. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=333.35999999999996s)]
*  We are a country of laws, not of men. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=334.91999999999996s)]
*  Can we take a turn and ask you about some stuff [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=338.0s)]
*  that's been going on in Michigan? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=339.92s)]
*  Earlier this, all my weeks come together, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  it was earlier this week. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=344.56s)]
*  There were last week. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=345.68s)]
*  Last week, Sunday. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=346.52000000000004s)]
*  Oh, it's Sunday, there we go. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=347.36s)]
*  There we are. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  Last week there were raids that were executed [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=349.68s)]
*  in about three different jurisdictions in Michigan, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  specifically related to a vandalism investigation. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=356.72s)]
*  And I just wanna read that we have [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=360.76s)]
*  on the information on this. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=363.04s)]
*  The homes of pro-Palestinian protesters [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=364.0s)]
*  were raided in a multi-jurisdictional [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=366.32s)]
*  vandalism investigation. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=368.04s)]
*  It was FBI along with local and state law enforcement. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=370.44s)]
*  They were involved in the raids. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=372.2s)]
*  Your office clarified that immigration officers [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=374.6s)]
*  were not involved and all involved were American citizens. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=377.04s)]
*  Your office said that the searches did not pertain [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=381.12s)]
*  to on-campus protest activity, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=382.92s)]
*  but a multi-jurisdictional investigation into vandalism. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=384.8s)]
*  I just have to ask because when I first read about this, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=387.68s)]
*  it made me wonder that if we were not talking about [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=391.72s)]
*  pro-Palestinian activity, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=394.92s)]
*  would these raids have been executed? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=397.04s)]
*  So what happened here? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=398.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, you're calling them raids [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=400.08s)]
*  and I understand that, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=401.72s)]
*  but this is the legal execution of search warrants [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=402.6s)]
*  where you have a court of law [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=404.8s)]
*  that has found that there's probable cause [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=406.68s)]
*  to believe that there's evidence of a crime [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=408.28000000000003s)]
*  in these various different homes [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  in which the search warrants were executed. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=412.58s)]
*  It really bothered me, by the way, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=415.68s)]
*  to see people talk about no-knock raids. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=417.12s)]
*  These were hours-long negotiations [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=419.92s)]
*  trying to get people to open the doors, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=422.44s)]
*  trying to get landlords to open the doors. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=424.16s)]
*  And the way that law enforcement works [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=426.48s)]
*  is that if you refuse to voluntarily cooperate [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=427.96s)]
*  and open a door, law enforcement doesn't just leave. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=431.2s)]
*  They doesn't leave the door. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=433.91999999999996s)]
*  They don't just walk away. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=434.76s)]
*  Why were the search warrants issued? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=435.84s)]
*  For what? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=438.28s)]
*  I guess for vandalism, people are, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=439.15999999999997s)]
*  there are warrants and you're going to folks' homes [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=442.08s)]
*  and people are knocking out the doors. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=443.76s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  So is it like, what was the reason? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=445.76s)]
*  Yeah, we are talking about, you know, again, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=448.12s)]
*  over a dozen locations, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=451.34s)]
*  including the Jewish Federation of Detroit, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=453.4s)]
*  including multiple elected officials' homes, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=455.88s)]
*  where you had, in many cases, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=460.24s)]
*  it wasn't just that you had vandalism that, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=461.76s)]
*  again, is terrifying in nature, right? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=466.8s)]
*  We're talking about people's homes that were defaced, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=469.64s)]
*  people's cars that were defaced, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=473.24s)]
*  people who had their children's windows broken in, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=474.76s)]
*  and then to have canisters full of noxious chemicals [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=478.94s)]
*  thrown into those rooms in the middle of the night. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=482.08s)]
*  And this went on over and over and over [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=484.84000000000003s)]
*  in municipalities all around Southeastern Michigan. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=487.76s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=491.56s)]
*  You can believe in a cause very much, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=492.40000000000003s)]
*  and I encourage people, absolutely. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=495.04s)]
*  I have been a part, over the course of many decades, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=497.2s)]
*  of peaceful, lawful protests. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=499.96000000000004s)]
*  But what you cannot do is commit crimes. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, to say to these people, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=506.76s)]
*  well, these are individuals who may believe very much [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=508.92s)]
*  in a particular cause. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=512.2s)]
*  And so in furtherance of that cause, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=513.76s)]
*  they can do literally anything they want, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=515.16s)]
*  including come to your home in the middle of the night [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=516.68s)]
*  and destroy your property. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=518.9s)]
*  And this had been going on for over a year. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=521.12s)]
*  And at a certain point, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=524.14s)]
*  when many different jurisdictions came together [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=526.68s)]
*  and discovered who we believed the perpetrators [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=530.6s)]
*  of those crimes were, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=533.3199999999999s)]
*  we did what we do in all crimes, right? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=534.4s)]
*  We obtained legal search warrants, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=536.4399999999999s)]
*  and we executed those search warrants. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=538.8s)]
*  And those cases will likely proceed [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=541.04s)]
*  based on the evidence that was discovered. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=543.24s)]
*  But what we can't do is say, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=545.46s)]
*  and I don't care what your cause is, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=547.36s)]
*  whether it's reproductive rights, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=550.52s)]
*  whether it's LGBTQ rights, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=553.4s)]
*  whether it's rights for African Americans, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=555.34s)]
*  whatever it is, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=559.2s)]
*  you can't commit crimes in furtherance of that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=560.8s)]
*  And you can't terrorize people. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=563.0s)]
*  You can't terrorize entire communities based on that. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=564.96s)]
*  And in my opinion, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=568.52s)]
*  many of the different types of graffiti [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=570.2s)]
*  was meant to inspire fear, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=573.9200000000001s)]
*  and not just individuals, but in this higher communities. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=576.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's why you attack a nonprofit [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  like the Jewish Federation, right? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=581.74s)]
*  And it's my job, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=584.72s)]
*  I'm the top law enforcement official in the state, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  and I can't walk away from these things. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=589.2s)]
*  And I can't say, well, if I agree with your cause [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=590.88s)]
*  or whether I disagree with your cause, it doesn't matter. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=594.26s)]
*  It's my job to enforce the law, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=596.88s)]
*  and it is exactly what we did. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=599.16s)]
*  And we don't prosecute people [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=601.12s)]
*  who are just exercising their first amendment, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=603.36s)]
*  again, peacefully and lawfully. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=605.9599999999999s)]
*  But if you're gonna break the law, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=608.64s)]
*  then you have to be held accountable. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=611.06s)]
*  And I think it's an important message going forward, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=612.26s)]
*  because I think a peaceful protesting [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=613.9399999999999s)]
*  is gonna be such a critically important part [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=616.12s)]
*  of fighting back against the Trump regime [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=619.76s)]
*  that is sliding very quickly into a full-blown autocracy. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=623.68s)]
*  So we need people to be in the streets. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=626.98s)]
*  We need people to be exercising their first amendment rights [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=629.38s)]
*  and to demonstrating and telling the Trump administration, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=633.46s)]
*  we are not okay with this. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=636.38s)]
*  But we- [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=638.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=639.1800000000001s)]
*  But we have to do it lawfully. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=640.0s)]
*  And we have to do it in a way [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=641.86s)]
*  where we're not attacking police officers. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=643.26s)]
*  And we have to do it in a way where we are showing [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=646.02s)]
*  that we are on the right side, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=648.98s)]
*  but we're not hurting people, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=651.58s)]
*  we're not attacking property, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=654.7s)]
*  because I don't think that's gonna win anybody over. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=656.02s)]
*  General Nessel. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=658.46s)]
*  Michigan, attorney general. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCIcNH5_wNI&t=659.54s)]
