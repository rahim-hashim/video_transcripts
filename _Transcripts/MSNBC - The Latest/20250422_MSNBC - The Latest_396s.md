# Where does the Catholic Church go from here? Pope Francis leaves behind progressive legacy
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk)
*  Pope Francis leaves behind a church that is divided just as the political world around [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=0.0s)]
*  him is. His papacy coinciding with a dramatic political shift in the U.S. and the global [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=8.96s)]
*  debates on immigration, climate change, income inequality, and what some LGBTQ Catholics [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=14.52s)]
*  call a seismic shift because of the pope for their community. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Senator Brian Massingale will tell you that at his core, he is a man of God. He is also [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=25.68s)]
*  an openly gay priest in a church where many LGBTQ Catholics had long ago given up hope [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=31.12s)]
*  of being accepted, let alone embraced. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=37.4s)]
*  Then why? Why not? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=40.68s)]
*  But Massingale believes Pope Francis changed things for the better. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=42.8s)]
*  He's opened the door for a conversation on issues that were previously closed. So I think [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  without question, Pope Francis will go down as being one of the most consequential and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=52.6s)]
*  pivotal figures in a new chapter of the church's engagement with LGBTQ persons. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=57.28s)]
*  The shift began on the papal plane, 2013, when Francis sent shockwaves through the church [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=62.96s)]
*  with five conciliatory words about gays and transgender people. Who am I to judge? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=68.92s)]
*  A decade later, Pope Francis formally allowed Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=77.6s)]
*  Not a change in doctrine, but a radical shift in approach to a group of Catholics who had [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  long been held at arm's length by church leaders. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  He didn't push this issue aside. He let it play out front and center. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=92.08s)]
*  But Francis' words also exposed deep divisions within the church. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=95.56s)]
*  Rhode Island Bishop Thomas Tobin wrote, the church cannot support the acceptance of objectively [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=100.28s)]
*  immoral relationships. Headlines warned of the damage Francis was doing in Africa, where [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=105.62s)]
*  the church is growing faster than any other place in the world. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=111.42s)]
*  Many U.S. priests said Francis sowed misinformation and confusion. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=115.74000000000001s)]
*  Certainly the Catholic Church loves everyone, but if we give the misimpression that homosexual [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=120.42s)]
*  activity is no longer sinful, therefore people who identify as homosexual have no problem, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=128.22s)]
*  for us a very serious source of concern. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=134.98000000000002s)]
*  Caught in the middle of that divide, gay Catholics themselves, including members of the Out Ministry [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=137.94s)]
*  at St. Paul's Church in Manhattan, one of many gay Catholic ministries that grew during [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=146.02s)]
*  Francis' papacy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=150.94s)]
*  I do think certain people on their faith journey needed to hear that from the pope. That was [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=151.94s)]
*  the olive branch that they needed to feel welcomed into the church again. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=158.54000000000002s)]
*  I don't think the LGBTQ community will feel equal in the church for a great many years [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=162.7s)]
*  to come. Francis has certainly been helpful in some of these changing attitudes, but the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=169.29999999999998s)]
*  church is enormous. So I think his biggest influence is the pastoral care, not really [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=174.17999999999998s)]
*  in any institutional change. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=181.33999999999997s)]
*  So while gay advocates acknowledge there are still many changes they will work toward, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=184.28s)]
*  Francis, they say, has made unprecedented strides in his papacy in opening minds and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=188.7s)]
*  doors for LGBTQ Catholics. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=194.5s)]
*  What does it mean to you when you hear the pope speak in ways that have never been spoken [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=197.66s)]
*  by the head of the church before? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=202.38s)]
*  I remember when he first said, who am I to judge? And as a gay man myself, I thought, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  I never thought I would ever hear a pope say those words. I think the pope's legacy is [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=214.5s)]
*  that he's changed the emphasis of the conversation. He's created a situation where it would be [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  very difficult for us to go back to where we were before. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=228.22s)]
*  Here with me now, Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, Christopher [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=236.02s)]
*  Wright. I also want to bring in former Republican Congressman and MSNBC political analyst Carlos [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=239.9s)]
*  Curbelo. You know, Chris Pope Francis helped marginalized people feel, and not just LGBTQ, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=245.34s)]
*  but marginalized people generally say that he opened doors for them. But I want to play [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=250.26s)]
*  for you. This is from Chicago, some members of an outreach group and what they had to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=254.38s)]
*  say. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=258.74s)]
*  Even through difficult times, he was a good friend for us and made us feel part of the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=262.7s)]
*  church. LGBTQ plus people have a spiritual part of themselves and they want that to be [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=269.7s)]
*  recognized as much as anything else. And Pope Francis understood that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=276.7s)]
*  The idea that the takeaway for so many LGBTQ Catholics was, I see you, I hear you. Did [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=284.22s)]
*  that change things? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=292.56s)]
*  I think so. I remember being in Lisbon with Pope Francis and he was speaking to a group [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=294.02s)]
*  of young people and he said, who has a place in the Catholic Church? Todos, todos, todos, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=297.92s)]
*  everyone, everyone, everyone. And he specifically, I think, was talking about those that are [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=302.32s)]
*  often marginalized in the church, particularly LGBTQ Catholics. And we saw that time and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  time again he was willing to say things, meet with people that up until this point had not [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=311.08000000000004s)]
*  really received the attention from the top guy in the church. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=315.44s)]
*  Yeah, making phone calls to people who run LGBTQ ministries. You know, Pope Francis in [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  his final moments in public spoke out about the suffering in Gaza, the plight of migrants [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=324.16s)]
*  across the globe. It reminded me of when he said, a person who thinks only about building [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=329.16s)]
*  walls is not Christian. He had that powerful words but a soft spoken voice. As someone [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=335.2s)]
*  who traveled with him to so many places, talk about the response that those kinds of pastoral [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=342.4s)]
*  messages got. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=350.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I remember just recently he was in South Sudan just a few years ago. And [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=351.12s)]
*  this was a trip that he, you know, he was advised against taking. And the country was [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=356.32s)]
*  war torn but he really thought, if I go there, this country might have a chance at peace. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=360.44s)]
*  And we saw even in his final will and testament he said, I'm offering up my suffering for [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=365.06s)]
*  the sake of world peace. And this is a Pope that I think that's what kept him awake at [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=369.52s)]
*  night and it's also what motivated him to get up in the morning. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbo_odpoblk&t=373.76s)]
