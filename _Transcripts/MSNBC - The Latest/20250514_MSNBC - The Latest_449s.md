# ‘Make America Sick Again’: Sen. Markey slams RFK Jr. and Trump’s health agenda
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78)
*  Joining us now, Democratic Senator of Massachusetts and member of the committee, Ed Markey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=0.0s)]
*  It's good to see you again, Senator, and I know you've been collecting stories about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=5.08s)]
*  how Secretary Kennedy's HHS has impacted people in your state. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=9.28s)]
*  How are they helping inform the questions you plan to ask at today's hearing? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=14.5s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=18.2s)]
*  I'm issuing a report today, the RFK Make America Sick Again agenda. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=20.36s)]
*  That's really what this is all about. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=29.12s)]
*  Right now, as we're talking over in the House of Representatives, they're having a marathon [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  hearing on slashing Medicaid, cutting a program which provides essential services for tens [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=37.2s)]
*  of millions of families in our country, the health care which they need. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=44.2s)]
*  At the same time, over in the Senate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is about to arrive to testify, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=48.18s)]
*  40% cut in NIH research for Alzheimer's, for heart disease, for diabetes, for all of those [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=54.7s)]
*  diseases which are running through all American families. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  He wants to slash that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=65.84s)]
*  A 45% cut in the CDC budget, that's the radar that we use in order to detect COVID or detect [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=67.22s)]
*  measles. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=73.94s)]
*  We're in the middle of a measles outbreak, the largest one in decades, and they want [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=74.94s)]
*  to slash the CDC budget by 45%. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=79.5s)]
*  They want to slash community health services where people, especially poor people, can [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=83.02s)]
*  go in and get the preventative care which they need by 20%. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=89.58s)]
*  They want to slash by 15%. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  The funding for mental health and substance abuse treatment in our country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=96.02s)]
*  So this is a multi-pronged attack upon the health care system in our nation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  And what my report ultimately is able to document is how it's harming ordinary families. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=107.98s)]
*  They're the ones that are waiting for the breakthroughs in cancer. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=114.62s)]
*  They're the ones that need the help for substance abuse and mental health, and they are putting [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  all of it on the chopping block to be destroyed. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=121.44s)]
*  So it is a bad day, and on top of that, all the cuts that Trump and Elon Musk have already [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=124.98s)]
*  slashing funding illegally for research, for hospitals, for health centers across this [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=131.78s)]
*  country. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=138.54s)]
*  So it's a three-pronged attack, and that is the headline for today. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=139.54s)]
*  It's what they are attempting to perpetrate as a health care crime against our nation. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=144.34s)]
*  It sounds like you're loaded for bear, and I'm guessing that there are other Democrats [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=149.98s)]
*  on the committee who are as well. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=153.78s)]
*  What can you accomplish? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=156.66s)]
*  What can you message that isn't already out there? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=157.74s)]
*  Well, the more that we put a spotlight on these issues is the more that we're hoping [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  that Republicans are going to back up because they're going to understand what the implications [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=167.18s)]
*  are for their constituents or, another way of describing them, their voters in 2026. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=171.3s)]
*  Well, have you gotten any indication in your conversations with them that that's happening? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=177.46s)]
*  Yes, we can already see that there are senators especially who are saying that it would be [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=182.98s)]
*  a huge mistake to have a huge cut to Medicaid. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  So that's my hope. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=192.45999999999998s)]
*  I'm talking to Republican senators about what a big mistake it would be to cut research [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=193.62s)]
*  for Alzheimer's and cancer and the other diseases that can have a cure which are found for them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=197.82s)]
*  So I'm already seeing the early signs that Republican senators at least, maybe not the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=204.42s)]
*  MAGA-controlled House of Representatives, but over in the Senate, there are senators [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=209.7s)]
*  who are starting to listen and the more we put the spotlight on it, in today's hearing, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=213.89999999999998s)]
*  there's an additional opportunity that we're going to have to demonstrate the harms to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=217.45999999999998s)]
*  families across our country. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=222.98s)]
*  And I think ultimately we have a chance, just a chance, of having some Republicans' conscience [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=224.54s)]
*  turn into Republican courage to vote against these cuts. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=230.42s)]
*  You mentioned measles and it comes, this testimony that we saw earlier today from RFK Jr. on [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=234.22s)]
*  the House side, comes as measles cases here in the U.S. have topped a thousand for the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=240.94s)]
*  first time in five years. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=246.18s)]
*  Here's what Secretary Kennedy told that panel this morning. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=247.94s)]
*  We are doing a better job at CDC today than any nation in the world at controlling this [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=253.14s)]
*  measles outbreak. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=257.38s)]
*  Better job than anywhere in the world, do you accept that statement? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=259.86s)]
*  Look at the United States, even right now, is only 38th internationally in health outcomes. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=263.82s)]
*  What we need is the Secretary of Health and Human Services to say, everyone get vaccinated. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=270.06s)]
*  Everyone is safe. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=275.42s)]
*  That's the message he should be sending. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=276.5s)]
*  He's the top health care official in our nation. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=277.82s)]
*  He still won't say it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=280.5s)]
*  And so that's the danger. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=282.21999999999997s)]
*  When there is a cloud that has left, especially because of his own past history, what he said [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  about vaccines until he absolutely says that not only should everyone get vaccinated, but [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=287.78s)]
*  we are going to put the national HHS resources into the communities that need it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=293.38s)]
*  Then we're going to see a continued explosion of measles and then followed by other diseases [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=298.34s)]
*  that we thought otherwise had been eradicated, not only in the United States, but because of [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=303.29999999999995s)]
*  our leadership around the world. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=308.41999999999996s)]
*  And let me ask you, we only have a minute left, Senator, but President Trump in Qatar today, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=310.5s)]
*  you told Time magazine his plan to accept a luxury jet from them would turn Air Force [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=315.78s)]
*  One into broad Force One. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=320.74s)]
*  We saw Chuck Schumer vow to block political nominees at DOJ over this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=323.14s)]
*  But is there anything more Democrats can do? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=327.62s)]
*  We just reported today retrofitting it could cost upwards of a billion dollars. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=330.06s)]
*  Yeah, this is like the Qatari saying we're going to give you a four hundred million dollar [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=335.21999999999997s)]
*  jalopy, but it's going to take you a billion dollars to make it work out on the road. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=340.58s)]
*  So that's not a gift. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=346.09999999999997s)]
*  That's that's just a bribe because they know because of the vanity of Donald Trump that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=347.38s)]
*  he would love to have something that is appointed in a way that's more conducive with his idea of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=354.02s)]
*  how Air Force One should be like Mar-a-Lago. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=360.02s)]
*  The problem is we don't know if the Qataris have turned this plane into radio shack with listening [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=363.21999999999997s)]
*  devices in every single part of it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=370.34s)]
*  So this whole plane will have to be disassembled and it will have to be rebuilt from the ground [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=373.21999999999997s)]
*  up in order to make sure that it meets all of our security needs, but also that the president, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=378.65999999999997s)]
*  as the plane is taking off potentially in the unavoidable event, perhaps that could occur in [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=383.29999999999995s)]
*  the future of a nuclear war, that he is protected, that all subsequent presidents are protected so [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=391.14s)]
*  that they can continue to have Air Force One as the command center. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=398.1s)]
*  So all of this is going to cost at least two, three, four times as much money as the gift [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=403.22s)]
*  that the Qataris seem to be giving him to just match his vanity in terms of how comfortable he [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=409.06s)]
*  should be on Air Force One. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=414.66s)]
*  It's a lot more than that, Mr. President. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=415.94s)]
*  It's the security of our country. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=417.94s)]
*  It's the place where the commander in chief will be able to protect our country in the case of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=419.46000000000004s)]
*  emergency. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  Senator Ed Markey, thank you. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=425.78000000000003s)]
*  It's good to see you again. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClRMtMBmy78&t=427.3s)]
