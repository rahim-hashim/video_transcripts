# ‘Could explain something’: Nicolle Wallace on Elon Musk’s reportedly intense drug use
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk)
*  This rocket company is the only reason we can now send American astronauts into space. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=0.0s)]
*  Come here. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=7.0s)]
*  Take over, Eli. Yes, take over. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=8.0s)]
*  Hi, everyone. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=16.0s)]
*  As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm Dark MAGA. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=25.0s)]
*  This next story could explain some things, maybe. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=30.0s)]
*  That was just one of the many chaotic moments, performative moments, of Elon Musk's time alongside Donald Trump on the campaign trail in 2024. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=34.0s)]
*  Now, some truly shocking new reporting by The New York Times finds that while campaigning with Donald Trump last year, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=44.0s)]
*  Elon Musk engaged in drug consumption that, quote, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=50.0s)]
*  went well beyond occasional use to the point where it began to have a physical impact on him. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=54.0s)]
*  New York Times reports this, quote, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=59.0s)]
*  He told people he was taking so much ketamine, a powerful anesthetic, that it was affecting his bladder, a known effect of chronic use. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=84.0s)]
*  He took ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms, and he traveled with a daily medication box that held about 20 pills, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=93.0s)]
*  including ones with the markings of the stimulant Adderall, as according to a photo of the box and people who have seen it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=100.0s)]
*  Musk has said that he was prescribed ketamine to treat depression, taking it approximately every two weeks. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=107.0s)]
*  He told his biographer this, quote, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=113.0s)]
*  However, The Times reports this, quote, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=119.0s)]
*  Musk had been using ketamine often, sometimes daily, and mixing it with other drugs, according to people familiar with his consumption. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=122.0s)]
*  The line between medical use and recreation was blurry, troubling some people close to him. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=129.0s)]
*  The New York Times notes that it is unclear whether he continued to take drugs when he began working at the White House. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=135.0s)]
*  Elon Musk's time in the administration was defined by the massive cuts he made to the federal workforce, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=143.0s)]
*  which have frequently been challenged in courts and often blocked, as well as reported interpersonal clashes with senior cabinet members, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=149.0s)]
*  including trade adviser Peter Navarro, who he called a, quote, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=157.0s)]
*  In the Oval Office today, Elon Musk lashed out at the New York Times without answering questions about the substance of its reporting. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=165.0s)]
*  NBC News has not been able to independently verify the Times' reporting. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=173.0s)]
*  The White House and Elon Musk did not respond to requests for comment from NBC News. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=177.0s)]
*  A White House spokesperson did issue a statement to the New York Times. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=182.0s)]
*  He declined to comment on Musk's drug use. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=186.0s)]
*  Joining our coverage is investigative reporter for the New York Times, Megan Toohey. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=189.0s)]
*  Her byline is on that reporting we read from. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=193.0s)]
*  Say more. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=196.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=197.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, listen, there has, you're right. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=198.0s)]
*  There has been some coverage of Elon Musk's drug use in the past. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=200.0s)]
*  He himself has acknowledged that he used ketamine, as he said it was with a prescription and only every couple of weeks to help with depression. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=206.0s)]
*  He. But what we found is that the drug use was much more frequently than previously known. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=214.0s)]
*  And it wasn't just the volume. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=221.0s)]
*  It was that these drugs appeared to be mixed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=223.0s)]
*  So from the ketamine use that at times has been near daily and got to the point where it was causing bladder issues as he was joining Trump on the campaign trail to the use of ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms, as well as this pill box that contained, you know, as many as 20 pills, including one with the marking of Adderall. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=227.0s)]
*  So there were some people close to him. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=248.0s)]
*  It's been really hard for reporters to penetrate. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=251.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=254.0s)]
*  Circle of people who know him. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=255.0s)]
*  But in recent months, people had started to talk to me and my colleague, Kirsten Grind, because there have been people close to him who have had concerns about his drug use. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=256.0s)]
*  This is going to sound like a dumb question. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=266.0s)]
*  But what is ketamine and what how do you take it? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=268.0s)]
*  And what would a normal either recreational or prescribed use look like? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=271.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good question. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=276.0s)]
*  It's a this powerful anesthetic that can serve as a sedative, and it has been approved by the FDA for use in medical procedures. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=278.0s)]
*  There are doctors who have prescribed it for psychiatric treatment like depression. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=288.0s)]
*  But those doctors are supposed to have special licenses and the FDA has warned that the use of this drug can come with these serious side effects and risks, including addiction and bladder issues. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=295.0s)]
*  Does that mean you lose? What are the bladder issues? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=308.0s)]
*  The bladder issues. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=310.0s)]
*  Those can. There's not. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=312.0s)]
*  It's not one single bladder issue that can come from chronic use of the drug, which can be, you know, can be consumed in a variety of ways, including like through lozenges and nose sprays. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=313.0s)]
*  In addition to being used medically, it has also become an increasingly popular recreational drug, I think, particularly in the sort of out West in the tech world. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=325.0s)]
*  And so but the FDA has warned that it can have these these side effects and the bladder issues can involve like pain and control. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=335.0s)]
*  My God, you don't even know what to say. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=345.0s)]
*  I mean, what is the sense that obviously the reporting is about a period in time that ended in November? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=348.0s)]
*  He's leaving after a lot of political analysis, sort of assessing that he costs the Republicans a seat in Wisconsin. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=357.0s)]
*  I mean, what is the sense of how much we still don't know about Elon Musk and Donald Trump? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=365.0s)]
*  Well, I think that that's a really good question. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=372.0s)]
*  And obviously our story comes at this moment when he is departing from Washington, at least to some extent. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=374.0s)]
*  And I think that we're you know, all of us are going to be processing and analyzing what has happened both publicly but also behind the scenes over the past year. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=380.0s)]
*  And it's also important to note that while our reporting on his drug use, this drug use that was much more intense than previously known kind of only went up through the end of last year. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=390.0s)]
*  And we can't say with certainty whether he was using continued to use drugs once he entered the White House and was given the keys to slash the federal bureaucracy. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=400.0s)]
*  And, you know, listen, we asked the White House about whether or not they had drug tested Musk and they refused to answer those questions. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=410.0s)]
*  And then we asked SpaceX, one of his companies, after he smoked weed in 2018 on Rogan's podcast, you know, that triggered SpaceX has billions of dollars in contracts and they are required because of that to maintain a drug free workplace and test their employees. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=420.0s)]
*  And then the reporting showed that Musk receives advanced warnings of those tests. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=439.0s)]
*  So what's certain is that there doesn't seem to be any like there hasn't been any sort of scrutiny or true monitoring or testing of this drug use, even as it sort of bubbled up behind the scenes. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=443.0s)]
*  And, you know, today the White House issued a statement saying to us saying that they, you know, just basically saying that they gave Musk a lot of credit for what he's done, but still refusing to answer our questions about whether or not they've drug tested him. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=455.0s)]
*  But importantly, did they deny anything in your story? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=471.0s)]
*  Nobody has denied anything in our story. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=473.0s)]
*  And today at this press conference, you know, the first question that Musk fielded was about our story and he shut that down. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=475.0s)]
*  He didn't even let the question out in its entirety. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=484.0s)]
*  He just, you know, he refused to engage in our reporting. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=487.0s)]
*  He, you know, he hadn't responded to our questions, so we started to submit as early as Monday and he basically just instructed everybody to move on. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=490.0s)]
*  I know he has a lot of personal relationships. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=498.0s)]
*  Are all of those relationships governed by NDAs or is it possible to report on any of his past partners? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=501.0s)]
*  It is extremely hard to report on him. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=508.0s)]
*  Like many powerful people, he has required NDAs of people in his inner circle and who have interacted with him. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=511.0s)]
*  But we were able to ultimately interview more than 12 people, more than a dozen people who have known him and have or have worked for him. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=519.0s)]
*  And so, you know, that felt to us like it was a significant body of people, including people, growing numbers of people who have been close to him, who have been worried about this. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=529.0s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes it's not people trying to make him look bad. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=539.0s)]
*  It's people that are most worried. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=542.0s)]
*  What can you tell us about the box of pills and the 20 pills a day? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=544.0s)]
*  I can barely choke down my vitamin C. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=547.0s)]
*  Yeah, listen, I mean, you know, we can't go into all the details of what we've observed in that box and say things with certainty. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=551.0s)]
*  You know, we were able to see a photograph of this pill box, this daily pill box that contained about 20 pills. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=560.0s)]
*  Can you say how big it is? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=566.0s)]
*  Yeah, like just like it's like about this big with divided like AM and PM. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=567.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, so we saw a photo of it and we've talked to people who have seen it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=572.0s)]
*  You know what we can say with certainty that it includes the stimulant Adderall. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=578.0s)]
*  So, you know, we're talking about ketamine, you know, which is the sedative. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=581.0s)]
*  We're talking about Adderall, a stimulant. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=585.0s)]
*  We're talking about these other psychedelic drugs. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=587.0s)]
*  And so, you know, once again, the concern has been not just the volume of drugs and the frequency, but the mixing of them. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=590.0s)]
*  It's unbelievable reporting. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=597.0s)]
*  It's so nice to see you. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=599.0s)]
*  So nice to see you too. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=600.0s)]
*  I hope you stay on the beat. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=601.0s)]
*  If there's more to learn, Megan Toohey, thank you very, very much. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=603.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTClaVR-vIk&t=608.0s)]
