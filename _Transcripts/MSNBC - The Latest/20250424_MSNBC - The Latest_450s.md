# Trump: You have no idea how I’m pressuring Russia
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw)
*  I want to bring back NBC News senior White House correspondent Gabe Gutierrez and Ned Price as well. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=0.0s)]
*  Ned, one of the things that he said was the next couple of days are going to be very important. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=5.92s)]
*  And as he lays out the deal, on one side, you have Russia that gets Crimea and the 20 percent [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=10.96s)]
*  of Ukraine that they currently occupy. When asked about the other side, what was in it for Ukraine, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=18.64s)]
*  he said they're stopping the taking of the whole country. He also thought, and again, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=25.76s)]
*  this is quoting him, I think they will accept. Do you hear a deal there that's acceptable? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=33.2s)]
*  Chris, let's be clear about what we just heard. It was a lot of bluster and a lot of lies. And [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  I'm glad you started where you did, because I think one of the most pernicious lies that we just heard [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=45.92s)]
*  was this idea that President Trump is putting pressure on President Putin. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=50.64s)]
*  President Trump is right that he is exerting a strategy of carrots and sticks. The problem [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=55.6s)]
*  is that it's all carrots for Russia and it's all sticks for Ukraine. And I say that because going [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=61.44s)]
*  back to the start of this process, you might recall, I'm sure you recall, President Zelensky's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=66.8s)]
*  visit to that very room, the Oval Office, when he was berated by President Trump, thrown out of the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=71.12s)]
*  White House. And after that, the administration halted security assistance. It halted the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=76.4s)]
*  provision of intelligence information that, by the way, had a practical impact on the ground, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=82.56s)]
*  and it cost Ukrainian lives, and it allowed Russia to carry forward its advance. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=88.72s)]
*  On the other hand, with Russia, they are indeed using carrots. There is a prospect of sanctions [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  relief. There's a prospect of U.S. recognition of Crimea, again, something that only a Robes [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=101.76s)]
*  gallery of countries around the world have done. There's the prospect of essentially recognizing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  all of the territorial gains that Russia has made since 2022. That's about 18, 20 percent [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  of Ukrainian territory. So President Trump might think this is the basis for a deal. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=119.44s)]
*  President Putin might think this is the basis for a deal, because indeed it would be a very favorable [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  deal for him. The problem is that this would not be a just peace. This would be, again, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=130.08s)]
*  capitulation. This would be appeasement rather than peace, and it would do nothing but incentivize [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=135.76000000000002s)]
*  President Putin and dictators and wannabe dictators the world over to attempt to undertake [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  the same type of territorial aggression that has cost Ukraine so much in terms of blood and treasure, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=147.44s)]
*  and that, by the way, has cost the United States and so many of our allies and partners so much [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=152.56s)]
*  in terms of treasure that will be replicated time and again if this were to go forward. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=157.76s)]
*  Ned, as you well know, a lot of Democrats felt pretty good about the fact that Marco Rubio [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=164.64s)]
*  was going to be the secretary of state. They voted for him. They voted to confirm him. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=169.04s)]
*  You heard what he had to say. He said, listen, he's the only leader who is talking about peace. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=173.6s)]
*  He's the only leader who is pushing for peace. Is he right about that? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, look, I think the nomination and ultimately the confirmation of Secretary [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=184.88s)]
*  Rubio with the unanimous vote is going to go down as a historic mistake on the part of those [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=192.24s)]
*  who voted for him. And I understand that he was a practically minded senator, but he has proven to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=198.16s)]
*  be anything but in terms of his time in office. And just earlier this week, he railed against [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=205.04s)]
*  the deep state and pockets of radicals within the State Department, just really echoing these [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=211.04s)]
*  MAGA talking points that, frankly, I think he knows better than to repeat. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=218.72s)]
*  And I think even more concerningly, he is really embracing President Trump's substantive positions [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=224.0s)]
*  on issues that he would have rejected three months ago, certainly three years ago, on issues like [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=230.32s)]
*  and in fact, his own State Department's website, as of about three hours ago, states very clearly [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=238.16s)]
*  that Crimea belongs to Ukraine and the United States will never, never recognize otherwise. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=244.8s)]
*  And yet you see Secretary Rubio on the couch in the Oval Office, really seconding everything [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=250.8s)]
*  the president has said. Again, we all want to see this war come to an end. It is a question of when [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=256.8s)]
*  it comes to an end, but it's also a question of how it comes to an end. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  And Senator Rubio would have known that a peace deal that provides Russia everything it wanted [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=266.56s)]
*  and deprived Ukraine of everything it needs and everything it has is not a recipe for peace. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=272.96s)]
*  It's a recipe for further aggression. And he would have understood the fact that it represented that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  for President Putin of Russia, but also people like President Xi of China, who would see that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  is a green light to move forward with their most ambitious territorial acquisitions [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=288.8s)]
*  that in some cases they've harbored for years on end. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  And Gabe, we know that these latest attacks from Russia on Ukraine that killed 12 people [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  angered or at least upset President Trump. We saw it in his Twitter where he said, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=305.04s)]
*  Vladimir, stop. Also asked about it. He said, you have no idea what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  Traditional pressure might be something like sanctions, but any insight [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  in Donald Trump's administration about what that pressure is or looks like? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=322.08s)]
*  Well, Chris, I want to go back to something you just zeroed in on. And you're right [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=327.2s)]
*  to really focus on this headline with Donald Trump, speaking about what concessions Russia [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=331.28s)]
*  should make, what you were discussing with Ned. Chris, back in February, when the India's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=336.08s)]
*  prime minister visited the White House, I asked the president back then what should Russia give [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=342.56s)]
*  up? Back then, he didn't give a direct answer and he really hasn't thus far. So I do think it is [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=346.88s)]
*  very significant that he is now pointing to this idea that the concession on the part of Russia [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=352.16s)]
*  would be simply to stop the war and not take any territory. That is very significant given the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=357.12s)]
*  context of the last couple of days with President Zelensky basically saying that it's a non-starter. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=362.16s)]
*  They will not recognize the territory that Russia seized illegally in Crimea. That won't work. And [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=368.08s)]
*  from being in Ukraine, I can tell you, many Ukrainians say that that just will not happen. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  Now, the president somehow seems to think that any peace deal, that that would [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  have to involve the recognition of Crimea, if not perhaps in Ukraine, perhaps the United States. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  But there are a lot of questions about how he's going to get to yes from both sides here. You [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=392.88s)]
*  mentioned the president did say he was not happy with the attacks overnight that Russia, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=397.52s)]
*  that were underway in Kiev overnight on behalf of Russia. And you heard Secretary of State Marco [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=404.08s)]
*  Rubio saying that that wasn't going in the right direction. But as you were speaking about with [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=409.28s)]
*  Ned, at this point, it is hard to see exactly what pressure President Trump is placing on [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=415.76s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, at least publicly. We just haven't seen it other than some social media posts, Chris. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=421.12s)]
*  Gabe Gutierrez and Ned Price, gentlemen, thank you. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlFORqemlDw&t=427.52s)]
