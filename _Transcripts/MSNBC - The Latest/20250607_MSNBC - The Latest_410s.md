# Deportation quotas: Rep. Garcia slams Trump admin for new ICE operation
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA)
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Robert Garcia of California. He's a member of that House Homeland Security Committee. Congressman Garcia, as always, thank you for coming to the weekend. Your reactions to the ICE raids in Los Angeles? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, I think, I mean, I mean, obviously we're not just devastated, but I think a lot of us in California especially are incredibly concerned about what's happening in our home state, but across the country. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=14.0s)]
*  What we're seeing is really not actions that are trying to target folks that are actually doing anything illegal or that are causing crimes. We're seeing these mass raids happening in areas that are peaceful. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=24.0s)]
*  The Garment District, we're seeing it at schools. We have two schools that where agents visited an elementary school back home in California, even in my in my own district, asking for children to come and see them at the school without parents permission. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=34.0s)]
*  We're seeing United States citizens, American citizens getting swept up. And so, look, I think everyone can agree that in this country, if you are here, you're committing crimes in this country. That is one thing. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=49.0s)]
*  And that's one thing. And those folks shouldn't be here. But if you're here illegally, you deserve due process. And these types of raids, I mean, sweeping up a national and state leader from the SCIU who was there to observe, who fortunately was released, is quite shameful. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=61.0s)]
*  You know, what you're talking about is Operation At Large, which is this kind of nationwide ICE led plan that is ramping up arrests of unauthorized immigrants. So you have a quota of 3000 arrests per day, more than 5000 personnel from across federal law enforcement agencies, 3000 ICE agents, 1800 from Homeland Security Investigations where they're supposed to be doing something else, 2000 DOJ employees, 500 CBP employees, 250 IRS agents, up to 2100 ICE agents. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=75.0s)]
*  So you have a quota of 1000 National Guard troops requested. We've never seen anything like this before in this country. This was promised by the president. But I'm curious what you think of them pulling folks from the other agencies, right? IRS agencies getting pulled up into this Operation At Large, for example. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=105.0s)]
*  This is really a huge problem. So here's, you know, I, before I got to Congress, I was mayor of my city of Long Beach for eight years. Law enforcement should be focused on law enforcement, making sure keeping people safe. What's happening here, and I think the concern for a lot of us is we're actually essentially now bringing in all sorts of people from agencies to do Donald Trump's bidding. These are folks that should be going right now after transnational criminals. These are folks that should be actually keeping the country safe. They should be focused on keeping our ports of entry safe. They should be focused on going [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=122.0s)]
*  after people that are cheating and scamming the American public. But instead, what's happening, we're forcing them to go visit and visit children in our schools. We're forcing them to go out and conduct these raids on innocent people and oftentimes without due process. So this idea that we're now trying to mobilize the entirety of the federal government for Donald Trump's deportation agenda, which is not actually focused on criminals and folks doing crime, but hitting some sort of quota. I think all Americans should be concerned about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=152.0s)]
*  that. Congressman, let me get your, let's switch gears and talk about Kilmar Abrego-Garcia. The White House press secretary called Democrats, quote, unhinged and wrong and says the party along with journalists were, quote, played like fools following Mr. Abrego-Garcia's return. Listen to what President Trump had to say about this, this, this case, and we'll get your reaction on the other side. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=182.0s)]
*  By the way, disaster. It's a whole disaster. We can look at it with this with this. And for the Democrats, look back at him. This was not the man from Maryland. This wonderful father from Maryland. This is a pretty, pretty bad guy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=209.56s)]
*  And Congressman, I played that for two reasons. One, so that people can hear what the president in the United States is saying about someone who was denied due process. And two, to point out the fact that what they're doing here is distracting the American people from the larger issue at hand. And that is denying someone their due process rights guaranteed in the Constitution to anyone in this country. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=227.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. Let's be really clear about what this is actually about. This is about enforcing a nine zero Supreme Court order. The Supreme Court, a conservative court, nine to zero, said that Mr. Abrego-Garcia should return to the United States. That's what this is about. It's about due process that every single in this country should have. This is not about what Mr. Abrego-Garcia may or may not have done. Whatever he may have done. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=254.44s)]
*  You're not defending that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=278.88s)]
*  Right. We're not defending that because at the end of the day, he's going to defend himself in a court of law and in front of a judge. And so that is up to him and his legal team. What we're saying is the Constitution in this country actually means something. The due right of due process for all persons actually means something. And the president of the United States cannot defy a Supreme Court order. And so why this matters is Donald Trump finally agreed to do what the Supreme Court said. As far as what Mr. Abrego-Garcia may or may not have done. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=279.6s)]
*  That's going to be between him, his attorneys and a judge. And that's exactly what should happen to any of us or any of our families. Something happened where we were accused of a crime. Someone in your family was accused of a crime. You better hope that you have the ability to stand in front of a judge and be able to defend yourself. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=309.6s)]
*  Congressman, you are also throwing your hat into the ring for ranking member of the House Oversight Committee. One major run, you know, there are other, you know, Jasmine Crockett, your congresswoman friend, has also done the same thing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=324.6s)]
*  Why do you think you'd be better than her or any of the others that are running? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=337.6s)]
*  Well, first, there's four people, obviously, that are looking at it. And all four are great. Obviously, I love Jasmine. And I think the other two leaders are actually fantastic. I think at the end of the day, oversight is at the heart of what Congress does to keep the administration accountable, but also to do government reform. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=340.6s)]
*  We're going to have to hold Donald Trump and the administration accountable for all the horrific things that have been happening through Doge, attacking the federal workforce and quite frankly, the corruption. I mean, a $400 million plane. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=355.6s)]
*  A fund where foreign agents can dump money to enrich his family. At the same time, I think Democrats need to be the party of government reform and innovation. It's not about Doge. It's not about that type of efficiency. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=367.6s)]
*  It's about how do we make government work for the American public? And I think we've got great candidates to do that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=382.6s)]
*  Thank you for coming on and happy pride. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=386.6s)]
*  Happy pride. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbPaUwhhKA&t=388.6s)]
