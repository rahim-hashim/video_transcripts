# New Jersey governor's race is set as Mikie Sherrill and Jack Ciattarelli win their primaries
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw)
*  And the race for New Jersey's next governor is now set. Democratic Congressman Mikey Sherrill [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=0.0s)]
*  and Republican Jack Cicciarelli have won their party's primaries in the Garden State, according [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=4.8s)]
*  to NBC News projections. Their victory set the stage for what will be one of the most closely [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  watched races of the year. New Jersey is one of two states with governor's races this year. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=13.76s)]
*  The contest likely to be an early sign of how voters are responding to President Trump's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=18.8s)]
*  second term. Joining us now, NBC News national politics reporter Bridget Bowman. She's been [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=23.04s)]
*  covering this race extensively. So let's start on the Democratic side because it was a competitive [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=27.6s)]
*  primary there. What worked for Sherrill to come out so decisively on top here? Yeah, that's right. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=31.92s)]
*  It was a really crowded primary. Six candidates. New Jersey hasn't seen a race like this in a really [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=36.88s)]
*  long time. And each of the candidates kind of represented different paths forward for the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=42.32s)]
*  Democratic party. You had your moderates, your really staunch progressives. You had Sherrill, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=46.24s)]
*  who was kind of in the middle of all of it. And one thing she was stressing along the way is she [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=50.8s)]
*  was pointing to her 2018 race where she flipped a long time Republican seat saying, I'm the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=55.28s)]
*  candidate that can win. And as I talked to a lot of Democratic voters in New Jersey, they told me [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=61.04s)]
*  they were really prioritizing electability. They wanted someone who could win. There's real concern [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=65.92s)]
*  that Republicans can win this seat in November given some of the historic trends in the state. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=70.56s)]
*  And another thing that voters were prioritizing is they were looking for a candidate who's going [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=75.76s)]
*  to stand up to President Trump. And some of Sherrill's supporters who I spoke with often [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  described her as tough. She's a former Navy helicopter pilot, a former prosecutor, a mom. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=83.92s)]
*  And they looked at her as somebody who could really push back against the Trump administration. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=89.84s)]
*  And those are the messages that Congresswoman Sherrill was really stressing on the campaign [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=93.2s)]
*  trial as well. Yeah. Stressing her pragmatism. That was also something she did often in Congress, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  as you and I both know from covering her. And then on the Republican side, you had President Trump [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=101.76s)]
*  weighing in on behalf of Chittarelli. Works in a primary. What happens in a general? Sure. Yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=105.84s)]
*  It really boosted Chittarelli in this primary. He won about two-thirds of the vote. A huge win for [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=111.84s)]
*  him. He carried every county in the state. And it's an interesting evolution when you look at him [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=116.72s)]
*  as well. He ran in 2021 for governor. Didn't campaign with Trump. Kind of kept him at a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=121.92s)]
*  distance. This time around is really embracing him. Some Republicans don't necessarily think [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=126.08s)]
*  that's a losing strategy now, given the gains that President Trump made in New Jersey. It saw the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=130.8s)]
*  second largest swing towards him of any state in the country in 2024. But we have actually started [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=135.68s)]
*  to see how Chittarelli is going to try to navigate the Trump dynamic. He started to say on the campaign [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=140.8s)]
*  trial, well, what does President Trump have to do with our property taxes? What do they have to do [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=145.28s)]
*  with our schools? And trying to keep the focus on Democrats who are in charge of the state government. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=148.72s)]
*  Last night in his speech, Chittarelli called Congresswoman Sherrill, Phil Murphy 2.0, referring [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=154.16000000000003s)]
*  to the Democratic governor and the state. So he's going to really try to localize this race. Yeah, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  definitely. And we'll see the way the Democrats allow or don't that to happen. But I was thinking [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=164.0s)]
*  yesterday as I was watching Sherrill that there might be a low key good story here for Democrats [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=168.56s)]
*  because a lot of their 2018 Natsac background candidates are now rising within the party. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  Alyssa Slockin is in the Senate in Michigan. Andy Kim, the Senate in New Jersey. Abigail Spanberger [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=180.08s)]
*  running for governor in Virginia, widely seen as the front runner there. And then of course, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=185.44s)]
*  you've got Mikey Sherrill now also ascending to that kind of a place. Is there a thread here that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=189.52s)]
*  Democrats could use as a blueprint? Yeah, I think so. And to see this class of candidates, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=194.72s)]
*  the class that took back the House in 2018, really rising as kind of the next, could they be the next [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=199.76s)]
*  leaders of the party as we're asking who is that next group of folks to be watching? This class is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  certainly one to watch. And Sherrill and Spanberger are going to be an interesting pair to watch this [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=209.76s)]
*  year in Virginia, New Jersey. They were former roommates when they were in Congress. They're [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=213.92s)]
*  very much aligned. They have very similar backgrounds. So it's going to be interesting to see how they [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=218.56s)]
*  navigate some of these issues that have proven thorny for the Democratic Party, like affordability, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=222.8s)]
*  like immigration. What lessons can the party take from their campaigns? And when I asked [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=227.52s)]
*  Congresswoman Sherrill that question, actually, what Democrats watching this race, what should [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=232.8s)]
*  they learn from you? She said that the path forward to her is pretty obvious for the party. It's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=236.4s)]
*  effectively governing. For her, she thinks that voters want the phrase that she uses, ruthless [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=240.96s)]
*  competence. She thinks that that's what voters are really looking for. Yeah, sounds like Mikey [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  Sherrill when you hear that quote. Bridget Bowman, thank you for your extensive reporting on this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=249.76s)]
*  It's going to be a fascinating race to watch. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLqRlZKImw&t=254.32s)]
