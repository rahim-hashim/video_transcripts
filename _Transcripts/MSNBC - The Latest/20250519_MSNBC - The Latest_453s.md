# How common is prostate cancer? Doctor explains more on Biden's diagnosis
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE)
*  It seems to me there's nothing that families and or the cancer, person suffering from cancer needs more than hope. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=0.0s)]
*  Hope. Hope that science will outrace the disease. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  That was then President Biden during remarks just last September, where he announced a new shared initiative to fight cancer between the U.S., Australia, Japan and India. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=17.8s)]
*  Worth highlighting as we learn the former president has been diagnosed with an advanced form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=27.6s)]
*  Former President Biden commenting on the diagnosis for the first time this morning on social media, thanking well wishers and saying thanks for the love and the support, posting this photo alongside his wife, former first lady, Jill Biden and their family cat. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=36.0s)]
*  For more on this, I want to bring in MSNBC medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=50.8s)]
*  She was the White House policy director under former President Obama. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=55.16s)]
*  Dr. Patel, thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  Let's just take a step back because prostate cancer is a fairly common cancer for men. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=60.8s)]
*  One in eight men in the U.S. get prostate cancer. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=66.44s)]
*  Explain how this cancer develops and what the early symptoms should be to catch it early. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=70.08s)]
*  Yeah, so prostate cancer, as you mentioned, is common. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=75.56s)]
*  There are different kinds of prostate cancer. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=78.44000000000001s)]
*  So that's what we're learning kind of from what the president has already kind of told us about what's available. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=80.44000000000001s)]
*  And just basically like many cancers, you kind of have like abnormal cells that develop in the prostate proliferate. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=85.56s)]
*  And then depending on how aggressive the cancer is, that can happen pretty quickly. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=93.0s)]
*  And that differentiation, like what makes one prostate cancer different from another, is how we get those scores and those grades. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  And we know that the president has a more advanced form based on the score they assigned him, the Gleason score of nine, highest scores, ten and grade five, which is the highest grade. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=102.68s)]
*  That just tells the doctors kind of where his cancer is based on the findings that they have. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  So based on what you just shared about the Gleason score and the later stage, the number that has been given to it, what does that tell you about how long this cancer could be developing, how serious it is, the potential prognosis? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=115.92s)]
*  Yeah, very important question because many of us, including myself, have been kind of scouring his previous records to see if he's had something called a prostate specific antigen. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=131.04s)]
*  It's a blood test. It's not perfect, but it's a blood test that you would have expected him to probably have had in the last several years. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=139.76s)]
*  That can be an early warning indicator. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=146.2s)]
*  This is just a plug to make sure that men get screened for prostate cancer as early as possible, starting at age 50 or younger. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=148.2s)]
*  The president, we assume, has had that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=154.52s)]
*  We know that he's had that diagnosis of enlarged prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia in 2019. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=156.88s)]
*  We have documentation of that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=163.12s)]
*  So one would think that he's had screening for it and that they would have caught this if they had screened for it earlier. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=164.56s)]
*  So we don't have that piece of data. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=170.68s)]
*  This is not the kind of cancer that crops up overnight. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=172.72s)]
*  But have I seen in my 20 years of practice, aggressive cancers emerge over months? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=175.28s)]
*  Yes, that is unusual. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=179.88s)]
*  So there is a possibility that it's been in place for longer than a period of months since we know how long the president's been out of the White House. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=181.4s)]
*  But it's not clear how long. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=190.12s)]
*  I think the most important thing here is that it is aggressive. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  It can grow rapidly and quickly, which is why I think the president is looking at these different treatment options. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=193.96s)]
*  Now, just how effective are those screenings? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=198.96s)]
*  Yeah, no screening is perfect. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=201.08s)]
*  I've had patients where I've done the yearly prostate specific antigen and even done a digital rectal exam and still have missed a cancer. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=203.4s)]
*  So the test itself, the PSA test is very good at detecting cancer when it's there, but it's not 100 percent. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=211.28s)]
*  So it can be anywhere from like an 85 to 90 percent detection rate, sometimes a little higher. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  What sometimes obscures these numbers on is that as you get older, the PSA is not necessarily as perfect. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=224.84s)]
*  And especially for somebody like the president that's already had a history of prostate issues, we know that sometimes the PSA doesn't correlate exactly. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  So lots of questions, I think, are coming up on social about like, what has he had? What's happened? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=238.52s)]
*  I like to try to think about like the here and now. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=243.72s)]
*  This is an advanced and aggressive form of cancer. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  But I have also seen treatment options where it's not curative. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=248.88s)]
*  But there are hopes that the president could emerge from this because he's otherwise in pretty good health, where he could have many, many years of a healthy long life. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=253.28s)]
*  So that is the silver lining and the type of cancer that we have here. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=261.16s)]
*  Obviously, everybody wants him to make this recovery. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=264.76s)]
*  Live a longer, healthier life in terms of trying to give our viewers some more news they can use. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=267.88s)]
*  Are there particular people who should be getting screened earlier than others? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=274.4s)]
*  Because you mentioned older aged men will likely be given the screening. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=278.2s)]
*  Likely it is. And this is something that comes up often with like who, what, when and where should people get this screening? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=282.88s)]
*  So standards kind of recommend the American College of American Urological Association, the American Cancer Society, many of our American College of Physicians. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=288.4s)]
*  Which I belong to. They all recommend screening standard to kind of talk about this with patients at the age of 50 or older. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=297.48s)]
*  However, we do know that there can be racial ethnic disparities. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=303.64000000000004s)]
*  So I actually like to open up this conversation with men, just like I do with women with other cancers early to find out family history, to find out also if men have any symptoms. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=307.16s)]
*  Early symptoms that I look for are urinary symptoms, sometimes sexual dysfunction. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  Sometimes they're non kind of blood in the urine that sometimes the person says, I thought that was incidental. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=321.16s)]
*  So you have to probe for these questions. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=326.12s)]
*  And I encourage everyone listening to this to use it to advocate for themselves. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=327.92s)]
*  Sometimes these stories, the word cancer, once I tell a patient, it doesn't matter on if they're the president of the United States or just a family friend. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=330.76s)]
*  Usually you stop listening. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  And I know the president and his family are processing this, but hopefully he can also be somebody who can push on learning, screening and research. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=339.64s)]
*  The reason I can sit here and tell you that we have treatment options today is because of decades of research at places like the NIH. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, and speaking of that research, the Moonshot Initiative, which we started our segment on, I mean, that was something that was a huge focus for President Biden, such a passion project of his, especially given the history and his family with his son, Bo dying of brain cancer. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=352.84s)]
*  Can you tell us what types of new tools doctors have that have been developed because of this type of initiative? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=367.4s)]
*  Yeah, so definitely like just the fact that we have treatment options. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=372.88s)]
*  I'll just give a simple example in the prostate. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=376.24s)]
*  We can do something called brachytherapy where we actually take kind of radiation seeds. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=378.88s)]
*  This sounds so futuristic, but it's because of the Moonshot and other cancer initiatives coming together where we now know that we can offer patients with prostate cancer, even very advanced prostate cancer, kind of a seeding mechanism so that there's radiation therapy to protect the normal cells, but also get rid of abnormal cells. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=382.88s)]
*  That's just one of many options that did not exist. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=399.44s)]
*  I will say that I have more options today than I thought were possible when I was a medical student of resident or a fellow, and I think it's incredibly important to keep our mind open to in the context of the president's diagnosis. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=402.24s)]
*  Do not lose sight that we're still seeing millions of people dying of cancer that could be prevented with better screening. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=413.52s)]
*  So we have we have things we can do today that we should be doing for men and women. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=420.12s)]
*  Well, thank you for bringing us that hope and just the potential for a better future for all of us. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=423.68s)]
*  Thank you so much, Dr. Patel. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnjnJGwMKE&t=430.12s)]
