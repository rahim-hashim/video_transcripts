# NOW: First witness takes stand in Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs trial
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c)
*  The first witness is now on the stand in the federal sex trafficking trial for Sean Diddy Combs in New York City after final jury [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=0.0s)]
*  selection and opening statements this morning. The prosecution portrayed the music mogul as the leader of a criminal [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=7.08s)]
*  conspiracy sex trafficking ring while the defense rejected that saying trying to turn Combs consensual sexual [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=13.64s)]
*  relationships into sex trafficking quote will not work. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=20.96s)]
*  Combs pled not guilty to charges of rocketeering conspiracy sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=24.919999999999998s)]
*  Joining me now Christy Greenberg former SDNY Criminal Division Deputy Chief former federal prosecutor and MSNBC [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=32.2s)]
*  legal analyst. So Christy you were inside the courtroom. Tell us what it was like in there. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  Well, it was packed there were two rows full of Sean Combs' family and friends [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=46.4s)]
*  as well as other members of the media and other members of the public that were very interested to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=52.64s)]
*  to learn what was happening. You had two [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  opening statements that portrayed a very different image of who Sean Combs is. You had the prosecutors [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=62.0s)]
*  saying that this man ran a criminal enterprise for over 20 years that he engaged in using force and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=68.04s)]
*  coercion in order to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=75.4s)]
*  make two separate victims engage in these commercial sex acts these freak offs that they did not want to participate in. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=77.28s)]
*  And then you had the other side, which is the defense having Sean Combs stand up and show a different side of him and say, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  look, he's indefensible in terms of committing domestic violence, but that doesn't mean he's a sex trafficker. That doesn't mean [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=93.2s)]
*  he engaged in racketeering and trying to make this distinction and really focusing on the victims and trying to turn the jurors [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  focus to the victims and say, look, they were strong, capable women and they made a choice. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=108.44s)]
*  Now, I think that will ultimately be a difficult thing for the defense to show because of all the evidence the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  prosecutors in the opening statements said that they had showing that actually these women really weren't making a choice. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=122.32s)]
*  You have the video of Cassie where, you know, Sean Combs is beating her, striking her, dragging her out of that hallway [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=128.72s)]
*  video when she was trying to leave one of these freak off sessions. That doesn't exactly look like a choice. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=136.36s)]
*  We also heard from the prosecutors that there are text messages where one of the victims known as Jane is saying, I don't [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  want to engage in these freak offs. I don't want to do this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=149.08s)]
*  And then there are apparently also recorded calls that we are going to hear between Sean Combs and Jane in which Sean [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=152.08s)]
*  Combs is offering her money and telling her to say that she wanted to engage in these freak offs. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=159.08s)]
*  None of those pieces of corroborating evidence sounds like these women had a choice. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=166.0s)]
*  So I think that is going to be really critical evidence for the prosecution. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=172.24s)]
*  And just one last point, even if there is there is the sex trafficking charges, but there is also there are two charges, one [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=176.2s)]
*  for each victim of transporting these women across state lines for the purposes of prostitution. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=183.2s)]
*  Those charges do not require force, fraud or coercion. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  So consenting adults traveling across state lines for the purpose of prostitution, if he did that, he is guilty. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=192.88s)]
*  So these arguments about the women had a choice. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  They they're not really a defense to these transportation for prostitution charges. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=203.2s)]
*  I think those charges in particular will be very difficult for the defense to overcome. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=207.64s)]
*  Let me ask you about the jury, as I understand eight men, four women, all from Manhattan, the Bronx, Westchester County, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  north of Manhattan, includes everyone from an investment analyst, a physician's assistant, scientists, UN worker. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=219.92s)]
*  I think several of them said that they've seen the video of Combs assaulting Cassie Ventura in an L.A. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=228.04s)]
*  Hotel hallway. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=233.68s)]
*  I wonder what your thoughts are on this jury and its makeup. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=236.16s)]
*  Well, as you said, more men than women, that's generally not what you'd want to see when you're prosecuting sex [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=241.84s)]
*  trafficking cases. You'd like to see more women on that jury. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=248.08s)]
*  It is a very, very diverse jury and both in, you know, in their backgrounds and their jobs and their educational backgrounds. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=250.88s)]
*  So bringing a lot of different experiences. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=265.84s)]
*  But, yes, they've all seen a very critical piece of evidence for the most part. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=267.68s)]
*  And the defense acknowledged that in the opening that, yes, many of you have seen this video. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=271.4s)]
*  And please keep an open mind and please try to separate what you've seen before coming into this courtroom from what you're going to see in the courtroom. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=276.52s)]
*  That is remarkable composure. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=286.56s)]
*  Can I just say with all those emergency vehicles going behind you, Kristi Greenberg, lawyer and reporter extraordinaire. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=288.56s)]
*  Thank you so much. I know you'll keep us posted as this trial goes on. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H0kIcSP0c&t=297.32s)]
