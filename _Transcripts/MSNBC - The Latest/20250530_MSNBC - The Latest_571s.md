# 'Performance artist' Trump injects more chaos into global trade
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow)
*  What do you make of the tariff rulings, Trump on again, off again? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=0.0s)]
*  And of course, what the courts originally did for him would have actually given him [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=5.28s)]
*  an elegant off-ramp where he could have said, I want to go for the tariffs, but of course [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  they're not letting me damn those judges. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=16.52s)]
*  But he has not. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=18.94s)]
*  He's back fighting for them. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=19.94s)]
*  And, you know, he's painted himself into a corner because he's a performance artist. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=21.36s)]
*  He's not a policymaker. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=25.88s)]
*  He campaigned saying he was going to impose suffocating tariffs on China, which he and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=27.2s)]
*  a number of reasonable analysts will regard as a hostile entity vis-a-vis the U.S. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=34.2s)]
*  But he also was doing it against the European Union, Mexico and Canada. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=40.76s)]
*  It made no sense from a purely diplomatic level, but also economically, he put a torch [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=44.84s)]
*  beneath an economy that he inherited from Joe Biden that was doing just fine. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=52.44s)]
*  And staring him in the face as the markets melted down and companies started screaming [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  about the pain it would cause him was a reckoning in the midterms next year. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  And he started to realize belatedly that he would probably pay a political penalty for [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=66.52s)]
*  all of this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=71.12s)]
*  And he was trying to find his way out of the mess. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=72.12s)]
*  And so he was going up and down. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=74.24s)]
*  Yes, I'll do the tariffs. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=75.4s)]
*  No, I won't do the tariffs. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=76.4s)]
*  Yes, I'll do the tariffs. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=77.4s)]
*  No, I won't do the tariffs. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=78.4s)]
*  And then on Thursday, the International Trade Court put a gift in his lap and said the president [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  is not allowed to unilaterally impose tariffs under the emergency power. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=85.12s)]
*  That would have been a tremendous gift. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  And he could have simply said to his supporters, the deep state got me. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=91.08s)]
*  The courts came and got me. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  They're screwing with me again. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=96.0s)]
*  And I wanted to do these tariffs. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=97.64s)]
*  I wanted to do these for you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  But I couldn't. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  But it's not my fault. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  But because Donald Trump has been called a chicken this week and for the last month, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  because he's been on a seesaw around tariffs, he cares more about his ego and how he presents [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=108.48s)]
*  himself in front of audiences. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=113.12s)]
*  And he couldn't help himself. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  So of course, immediately the White House appealed that ruling. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=116.68s)]
*  It will probably go to the Supreme Court. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  And Trump missed an opportunity to elegantly slip away from this mess he's created. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  When that ruling happened the other night, a source close to Scott Vest and said to me, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=127.2s)]
*  this is like Scott Vest and just one power ball. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=132.68s)]
*  He is going to get out of this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=134.88s)]
*  What a huge win. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=136.72s)]
*  And that 24 hours later, they're appealing it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=137.72s)]
*  But Trump knows, right, Trump is complaining about the courts, the courts, all these bad [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=140.32s)]
*  judges. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=144.44s)]
*  But if there's one thing he's great at, it's working the courts. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=145.44s)]
*  It was exactly one year ago today, this man was convicted of 34 counts, felonies for falsifying [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=148.68s)]
*  business records. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=157.0s)]
*  And what did he do? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=158.0s)]
*  He worked the whole system and he became president again. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=159.0s)]
*  So are we foolish to think, well, the courts, they're really going to hold him to account [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=161.52s)]
*  because they certainly didn't there. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=165.88s)]
*  No. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=167.68s)]
*  And he spins his way out of seemingly every one of those impossible situations. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=168.68s)]
*  Stephanie, I just spent the last couple of months on the road talking to hundreds of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=174.32s)]
*  people in town halls and in focus groups. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  And what I'm hearing on a day in and day out business. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=181.44s)]
*  I'm dying to hear this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  But there's a cost of this chaos, right? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  Washington, D.C. has this price and Wall Street has this price. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=189.12s)]
*  But Main Street does not have this price. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=192.84s)]
*  And there are people who are already literally waking up in the middle of the night about [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=195.64s)]
*  anxiety around inflation and access to health care, mental health care. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=200.56s)]
*  But when you're adding this additional concern about manufacturing jobs, especially with [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=205.96s)]
*  the steel prices here, millions of people are concerned right this moment about not [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=212.48s)]
*  just the 401Ks, if they're lucky to have them, but also about a job in the next week and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=217.16s)]
*  the next month. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=221.88s)]
*  There's a real cost to this chaos. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=222.88s)]
*  I think there will be soon politically for Trump, but certainly across America. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=225.36s)]
*  And it's serious. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=229.56s)]
*  Peter Navarro, who has never been an elected official, who has never run a big business [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=230.56s)]
*  or a small business business or even been a credible economic expert, but he is a close [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=234.72s)]
*  adviser on trade to the president this week. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=241.68s)]
*  He basically said to the courts, even if we lose, we will win. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  We will find a way to do it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=248.32s)]
*  This is our game plan. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=250.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=251.04s)]
*  Or they'll just completely ignore the courts, which it seems like is their strategy overall. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=252.04s)]
*  I mean, he's president mayhem. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=255.56s)]
*  And I think the important point to wrap all this around, whether it's tariffs or Ukraine [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  or immigration, is it's chaos. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  It's mayhem. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=263.32000000000005s)]
*  And it's exhausting. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=264.32000000000005s)]
*  Life in America is hard. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=265.32000000000005s)]
*  And I think most people feel that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=266.72s)]
*  And they feel like he's making it harder, especially middle-class people, independent [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=268.16s)]
*  people. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=271.8s)]
*  People are sick already of the drama. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=272.8s)]
*  And he's seeing pushback on tariffs. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=274.88s)]
*  I think only 30% of the country supports it overall. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=276.20000000000005s)]
*  Even Karl Rove. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=278.72s)]
*  And we haven't even felt the impact of them yet. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=279.72s)]
*  And Karl Rove is warning it could cost him in the midterms. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=281.6s)]
*  But I think the overwhelming aura that will always be Donald Trump, now in his second [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=283.68s)]
*  term it's 2.0, it's president mayhem and extends to the Department of Defense and everybody [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=287.52s)]
*  in his orbit. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=292.04s)]
*  And it's catching up with him. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=293.04s)]
*  It's catching up with him on Main Street because they're sick and tired of the drama. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=294.04s)]
*  Even if the tariffs are declared illegal, how and why would any other country in good [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=297.96000000000004s)]
*  conscience negotiate with the president? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=303.64s)]
*  Scott Besson actually said this week things have stalled out a bit with China. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=306.12s)]
*  The president seems to think we're in the catbird seat. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=310.24s)]
*  We're in this position as the United States of America, this massive superpower. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=313.68s)]
*  But I don't see how we have all this game when it comes to negotiating when they're [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=318.04s)]
*  watching this seesaw. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=321.76s)]
*  Well, I would first say that right now the rest of the world is making agreements without [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=323.04s)]
*  us. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=327.68s)]
*  This week in Malaysia, the Association of Southeast Nations, China and the Association [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=328.68s)]
*  states met and they made a declaration that they are going to be working together on geopolitical [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=336.62s)]
*  and economic cooperation. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=342.14s)]
*  And then as aside from that, the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=344.08s)]
*  Nations made an agreement among themselves that they would not make any bilateral trade [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=349.42s)]
*  deals with the United States that would harm any of the other ones. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=354.82s)]
*  And those are very important manufacturing countries, Cambodia, Vietnam, these are all [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=359.06s)]
*  places that the Trump administration in their first term said that businesses should go [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=363.06s)]
*  to when they put on those original China tariffs. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=367.46s)]
*  And then the second thing is there was something in the big, beautiful bill that I were not [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=369.65999999999997s)]
*  calling it that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=374.34s)]
*  OK, great. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=375.34s)]
*  In the budget, the bill, there are provisions in there which basically would require anyone [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=376.34s)]
*  who brings a case against the court to put up a bond in order to for the court to enforce [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=382.41999999999996s)]
*  their order. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=387.18s)]
*  So if this bill gets passed, people don't even realize this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=388.18s)]
*  They're already saying they're not going to listen to court orders. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=391.65999999999997s)]
*  And this bill actually prevents the court from enforcing their own orders. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=394.41999999999996s)]
*  So there's really no negotiating power that the United States has. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=398.78s)]
*  And I think Trump knows that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=402.58s)]
*  But he doesn't care because his fortune is in crypto and he's able to use the markets [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=404.21999999999997s)]
*  and his control over when he's going to announce this or that to enrich his friends. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=408.78s)]
*  Not just that, when you think about all the countries that are negotiating with the president, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=413.5s)]
*  not necessarily the big ones, they are offering, how about a hotel development here? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=417.66s)]
*  Golf course fare. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=422.3s)]
*  Here's a jet. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=423.3s)]
*  Correct. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=424.3s)]
*  So when you think about the United States, the American worker, the American business [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=425.3s)]
*  might not be benefiting, but the Trump orbit is. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=427.86s)]
*  But even if the tariffs hurt Donald Trump, it's not a guarantee that what Donald Trump [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=431.3s)]
*  is doing is going to help Democrats because we're not hearing much from them. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=438.66s)]
*  No. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=442.62s)]
*  Take us to the town halls. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=443.62s)]
*  In the town halls, a lot of young men in particular give Trump some credit for trying to do something, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=445.42s)]
*  for trying to do something. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=458.66s)]
*  They don't see the same from Democrats. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=459.94s)]
*  It's difficult now, obviously, being the party out of power. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=462.1s)]
*  But what Democrats need to do is they need to begin to show up and enter these conversations [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=465.42s)]
*  because there's obviously this sense that Republicans and Trump right now seem to be [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=470.78s)]
*  strong even if not always right, and Democrats just need to be in that conversation. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=476.29999999999995s)]
*  They'll tell me in these town halls that a Democrat is like someone who walks into a [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=480.65999999999997s)]
*  bar, maybe wearing regular person's clothes, but then takes off the jacket and has a five-piece [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=485.85999999999996s)]
*  suit just like basically Republicans. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=492.5s)]
*  They don't see a difference. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=495.34s)]
*  They'll give you a 300-point plan and you get through the first five or six steps and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=496.9s)]
*  kind of walk away. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=501.02s)]
*  That is the impression that what I'm hearing about Democrats today. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=502.26s)]
*  What they can do is take a lesson from Donald Trump who's genius when it comes to marketing [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=506.21999999999997s)]
*  and an abject failure when it comes to actually doing something to serve all these people. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=512.22s)]
*  But let's talk about Taco. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=517.18s)]
*  Trump always chickens out, right? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=520.16s)]
*  A name that was coined this week that Donald Trump was given from the Financial Times. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=522.22s)]
*  Donald Trump is actually the master at giving nicknames Little Marco, all the others. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=526.26s)]
*  This one's getting under his skin. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=530.98s)]
*  It's getting under his skin because he's being called a chicken again. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=532.9s)]
*  And Donald Trump, you know, he once told me that the reason he admired John Gotti was [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=536.4599999999999s)]
*  Gotti never flinched, Gotti sat in the courtroom, he took it on, he didn't weep, he gave everyone [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=540.78s)]
*  the evil eye, and that's how he rolled. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=545.98s)]
*  And that's how Trump conceives of himself. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMZEqcCdMow&t=548.26s)]
