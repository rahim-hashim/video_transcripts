Video Description: As part of an Executive Order signed in mid-March, the Trump Administration ordered several governmental entities be stripped down. One of them is called the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The IMLS is a tiny, independent federal agency with just about 70 employees. It provides funding for public libraries in every single state and territory. Could this be the beginning of the end for the main source of federal support for public libraries? Many people fear that the answer is yes. But some people – publishers, authors, and libraries – aren’t waiting around to find out. They’re fighting back. One of those people is Jon Yaged, the CEO of Macmillan Publishers.

# Velshi Banned Book Club: Publishers enter the book banning battle
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0)
*  A few months ago we crossed a major milestone on the Velshi Band Book Club, 100 meetings. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=0.0s)]
*  We marked the occasion the only way a journalist ever really wants to celebrate anything by [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=7.38s)]
*  writing an op-ed. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=10.76s)]
*  In it I wrote, quote, every single author we interview and every work of literature [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=11.76s)]
*  we profile, from universally beloved classics to contemporary buzzy novels, serves to highlight [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=16.26s)]
*  this intensely scary moment. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=21.56s)]
*  Every act of censorship, every attempted removal, and every ban is a flashing red warning sign [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=24.14s)]
*  we can't ignore, end quote. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=29.74s)]
*  And just recently the literary world received yet another sign that can't be ignored. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=31.7s)]
*  As part of an executive order signed in mid-March, the Trump administration ordered several governmental [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=36.32s)]
*  entities to be stripped down. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=41.06s)]
*  And one of them, which I bet you've never heard of, is the Institute of Museum and Library [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=42.66s)]
*  Services. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=47.5s)]
*  The IMLS is a tiny, independent federal agency which has about 70 employees. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=48.82s)]
*  It provides funding for public libraries in every single state and territory. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=54.82s)]
*  The American Library Association has sued the Trump administration over its attempts [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=59.68s)]
*  to shrink the agency. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=63.72s)]
*  According to that lawsuit, Doge fired nearly all the IMLS staff and began canceling grants. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=65.54s)]
*  The lawsuit argues that such deep cuts to the agency threaten to disrupt the operations [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=72.86s)]
*  of libraries across the country. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=77.36s)]
*  Could this be the beginning of the end for the main source of federal support for public [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=80.1s)]
*  libraries? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=84.2s)]
*  Many people fear the answer is yes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=85.2s)]
*  Look at what's already happened. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=87.48s)]
*  Quote, Mississippi local libraries face cuts due to executive order. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=88.76s)]
*  Public libraries in Georgia brace for federal cuts. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=93.0s)]
*  In the Midwest, small Wisconsin libraries might be hit hard as Trump targets federal [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=95.76s)]
*  funding. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=99.68s)]
*  In the Northwest, federal funding pulled from Washington state libraries, including the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=100.68s)]
*  Washington Talking Book and Braille Library in Seattle. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=104.44s)]
*  I mean, I don't remember Trump campaigning on a promise to cut local library funding, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=107.48s)]
*  but like I said, there were warnings. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=112.08s)]
*  We have to preserve the school and public libraries that define our nation and have [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=113.86s)]
*  defined it since its inception. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=118.22s)]
*  Just look up the free library in Philadelphia. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=121.74s)]
*  It's a concept that is American. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=124.78s)]
*  There is no other option. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=126.46s)]
*  What happens without access to books, without access to critical thinking and to reasoning [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=127.72s)]
*  and to empathy? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=131.86s)]
*  Some of the loudest voices in the literary world are not interested in finding out the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=132.86s)]
*  answer to that question. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=136.9s)]
*  Right after the break, I'm joined by one of those leading voices, John Yegget, CEO of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=138.3s)]
*  Macmillan Publishers, to discuss what the future may hold for libraries, readers and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=141.62s)]
*  writers alike. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=146.18s)]
*  The Velshy Band Book Club is back in just a moment. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=147.18s)]
*  Today's meeting of the Velshy Band Book Club is officially underway. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=152.54s)]
*  Joining me now is the CEO of Macmillan Publishers U.S., John Yegget. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=154.94s)]
*  Macmillan is one of the largest and oldest publishers in the world and is responsible [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=158.46s)]
*  for bringing to life some of our most memorable Velshy Band Book Club features, including [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  Blue by George M. Johnson, The 57 Bus by Daska Slater and Speak by Laurie Hulse Anderson. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=167.18s)]
*  John, good to see you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=173.98000000000002s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=174.98000000000002s)]
*  And thanks for all the work you're doing to bring light on this incredibly difficult subject [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  of band book. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=180.26000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it is tough. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=181.26000000000002s)]
*  And I want to start with this Institute of Museum and Library Services, literally something [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=182.26000000000002s)]
*  most people have never heard about. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=187.5s)]
*  And yet critical. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=189.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=191.10000000000002s)]
*  And the amount of money that we, the government gave to IELTS to begin with is miniscule. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=192.48s)]
*  When you break it down, the last number I saw, if you take the total grants that the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=197.88s)]
*  IELTS gave, it's less than 80 cents per person in the country. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  If we can't afford 80 cents per person for libraries, I don't know what we could do, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=205.5s)]
*  you know? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=210.2s)]
*  So this issue of book banning has had a number of fronts, but one of them is it has caused [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=211.2s)]
*  publishers like you to get involved in litigation. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=216.72s)]
*  Talk to me about how that works and how you think about that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=220.8s)]
*  Well, it becomes existential. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  After a while, things start bubbling up. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=226.96s)]
*  You know from all your work in book banning, the battlefront is really everywhere there's [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  a school, everywhere there's a library, every community. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=233.0s)]
*  There's 13,000 school districts. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=235.56s)]
*  So it's a lot of fights. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=237.88000000000002s)]
*  Then all of a sudden states start passing statutes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  You're like, someone's got to say something. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=242.44s)]
*  And the publishers are starting to say something. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=244.84s)]
*  You know, encouraging us to do it and it doesn't take much encouragement. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=247.56s)]
*  It needs to be done. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=251.04s)]
*  And some of these laws are incredibly vague. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=252.04s)]
*  They're dealing with subjects that have already been longstanding laws that they're trying [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=255.28s)]
*  to overturn and circumvent. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=259.12s)]
*  So we got to just say no. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  We got to say no. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=263.72s)]
*  We got to fight the fight. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=264.72s)]
*  How has the book banning craze that we're in affected how publishers think about publishing [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=265.72s)]
*  books and authors? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=271.96s)]
*  Do you look at a book and say, this is great, but you know this is going to be targeted. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=273.96s)]
*  And is that a good thing or a bad thing? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=278.79999999999995s)]
*  We think about if a book's going to be targeted, it doesn't affect our decision if we're going [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=280.79999999999995s)]
*  to publish the book. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=284.52s)]
*  We publish a book based on the book's merits. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=285.52s)]
*  Once we make that decision, we deal with it if there's going to be blowback. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=287.64s)]
*  We don't let it affect how we're going to publish. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=290.91999999999996s)]
*  And does it? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=292.56s)]
*  In some cases, certainly for brand name authors and big authors, the book banning doesn't [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=293.64s)]
*  as much commercially. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=300.32s)]
*  Is that the case across the board? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=303.92s)]
*  It's not. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=305.32s)]
*  I mean, there are always instances where some buzz, some publicity could get a book to spike [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=306.32s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=310.92s)]
*  But by and large, depending on which numbers you look at, Penn said there was 10,000 books [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=311.92s)]
*  banned in the 23, 24 school year. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=316.04s)]
*  Believe me, the vast majority of those are not getting a benefit. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=319.64s)]
*  And when you think about it, a lot of these books, particularly children's books, where [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=322.4s)]
*  I started my career in children's books, they live in a library for sometimes decades. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=325.4s)]
*  And if the libraries are scared to buy the book in the first place, those books are never [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=330.79999999999995s)]
*  going to find an audience. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=334.12s)]
*  So it's really not a good thing overall. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=335.2s)]
*  And let me explore that, because we've done some children's books, but we've done fewer [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=338.76s)]
*  than other types of books. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=342.0s)]
*  It occurred to me that children's books, particularly board books or books with pictures in them, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=344.44s)]
*  they're uniquely expensive. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  And so in many cases, parents may not be able to afford to buy all of them or the most current [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=350.52s)]
*  ones. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  When we start taking books like that away from schools and libraries, you really are [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  affecting children's learning at the earliest stages. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=360.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's no question about it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=363.72s)]
*  And board books are still, call it $18, $19. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=365.48s)]
*  They're 32 pages usually. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=369.12s)]
*  It's per page, it's an expensive proposition, but they're beautiful art, they're incredibly [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=371.52000000000004s)]
*  meaningful. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=375.36s)]
*  And when we say kids books, we're talking picture books all the way up through YA, like [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=376.68s)]
*  George's book you mentioned or Laurie's book. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=380.6s)]
*  You speak that you mentioned earlier, Daschka's book as well. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=382.64s)]
*  All those are YA. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=385.24s)]
*  The key thing about the bans for young kids in particular is we know that one of the best [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=387.52s)]
*  indicators for kids to read a grade level is access to books at home. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  And if you can't afford to get a book, you're going to the library. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=396.03999999999996s)]
*  And if the library is not going to have that book, we're really sort of shooting ourselves [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=399.08s)]
*  in the foot as a society. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=401.96s)]
*  Let's talk about George. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=402.96s)]
*  George was actually our first official Belchee Band Book Club member. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  It has been the top band book in the nation for years now. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=410.76s)]
*  Talk to me about this. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=418.28s)]
*  It's almost become a cultural touchstone. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=419.28s)]
*  George M. Johnson is the name they use. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=421.56s)]
*  The book banners are always, by the way, every book banner I've ever heard doesn't seem to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  know what the book's about. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=426.92s)]
*  They know that it's got some bad words in it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=427.92s)]
*  And if pressed, they might be able to tell you who George M. Johnson is. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=434.48s)]
*  Most of the people that ban books never read the books. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=435.48s)]
*  So that's one of the biggest problems we have. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=437.12s)]
*  George is really a special, special person. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=439.64s)]
*  George comes out. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=444.28s)]
*  George is an advocate. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=445.4s)]
*  They fight. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=447.2s)]
*  But I know it also takes a toll on George. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=448.2s)]
*  You don't always want to have to fight for who you are. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=452.24s)]
*  And when you look at what's in that book, when you read that book, it's a heartwarming [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=455.76s)]
*  coming of age story talking about things that so many people deal with. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=459.15999999999997s)]
*  And now we're going to ban that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=464.24s)]
*  It makes absolutely no sense. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=465.4s)]
*  But there's tough material in it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=466.4s)]
*  And there's tough material in a lot of books. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=467.68s)]
*  But that's, I guess, why we have brains, right? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=468.92s)]
*  We're meant to be able to manage through tough material. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=471.12s)]
*  And if you need to do that with a teacher or in a school or the librarian or your parents, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=473.96000000000004s)]
*  I think we all agree that that's great. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=477.52000000000004s)]
*  But tough material can't be avoided. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=481.64000000000004s)]
*  And there's nothing in that book that you don't find in five minutes looking at your [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=482.64000000000004s)]
*  phone if you're a kid. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=484.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=485.96000000000004s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  Banning of books seems to be an old-fashioned analog way of thinking about the world. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=488.24s)]
*  As long as there have been books, there have been people trying to ban them. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=493.58000000000004s)]
*  But in this day and age, kids are getting their information. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=496.28000000000003s)]
*  They're hearing words and seeing things far worse than anything we're putting in books [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=498.8s)]
*  every day on their phone. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=502.36s)]
*  Is book banning putting a damper on pitches you get, or is it increasing it? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=503.74s)]
*  Because you're right. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=509.0s)]
*  Some people don't want the fight. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=510.0s)]
*  They just want to write their book. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=511.0s)]
*  It's hard to tell because that self-centership is what's happening. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=512.0s)]
*  There's so many attacks coming from so many places. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=514.6s)]
*  I would be surprised if some author's saying, you know what? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=517.4s)]
*  Maybe I won't write that one today. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=520.3s)]
*  I don't know for sure. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=521.96s)]
*  But I'd be surprised if it wasn't happening. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=522.96s)]
*  John, good to see you. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=524.4s)]
*  Thank you for the work that you're doing. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=525.5s)]
*  John Yegut is the CEO of Macmillan U. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S_XPwvefe0&t=526.5s)]
