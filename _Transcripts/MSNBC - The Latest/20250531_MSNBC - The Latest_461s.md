# ‘A lack of understanding’: Fmr. Senator weighs in on GOP Senator’s Social Security comments
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA)
*  Right now, President Trump's big, beautiful budget bill is headed to the Senate, where [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=0.0s)]
*  it faces surprise opposition from some Republicans. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=4.88s)]
*  Senators like Josh Hawley, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, all expressing concerns about [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=8.68s)]
*  major cuts to Social Security. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Constituents are certainly making their voices heard at town halls. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=17.2s)]
*  Iowa Senator Joni Ernst facing blowback today after making this controversial comment at [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=20.04s)]
*  a town hall Friday. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=25.62s)]
*  When you are arguing about illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits, 1.4 million, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=28.12s)]
*  1.4 million, they're not eligible. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  So they will be coming off. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  So people are not, well, we all are going to die. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Joining us now, former Democratic Senator from Montana and MSNBC political analyst, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=51.48s)]
*  Jon Tester. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=58.48s)]
*  Good to see you, Senator. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=59.48s)]
*  What, sir, do you make of that? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  I mean, look, she's not wrong per se, but was the tone wrong? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=62.76s)]
*  And continuing with, for heaven's sakes, for heaven's sakes, folks, I mean, what are Iowans [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=66.72s)]
*  supposed to take away from that? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=70.72s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think she tried to use it to deflect. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=72.72s)]
*  Didn't work too well. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=77.12s)]
*  And I think what I take away from it, and I think Iowans would too, is that folks in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=78.56s)]
*  Washington, D.C., in Congress, aren't taking their job seriously. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=83.56s)]
*  I mean, look, if you've taken a strap like that point of view out, then it makes perfect [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=86.56s)]
*  sense to cut NIH. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=92.08s)]
*  Because why? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  Because why does research matter? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  We're going to die anyway. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  It makes perfect sense to cut Medicaid and shut down rural hospitals all over the country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=101.6s)]
*  Because, look, you don't need healthcare. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=102.6s)]
*  You're going to die anyway. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=104.02s)]
*  I mean, I just think it's just a lack of understanding. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=105.02s)]
*  I will tell you that, you know, you've got to get—I applaud her effort to have a town [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=110.17999999999999s)]
*  hall meeting. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  I think that's really good. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  And I think Republicans ought to do more of that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=118.38s)]
*  Democrats are doing that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=120.86s)]
*  But Republicans ought to do more of it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=121.86s)]
*  But the truth is, listen to the questions that are there. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=123.5s)]
*  They're very informative. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=126.86s)]
*  And for her to, you know, deflect and say, you know, oh, this is—you know, people are [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=127.86s)]
*  going to die anyway. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=132.74s)]
*  I mean, I'm sorry about it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=133.74s)]
*  I mean, my God, how not being in touch with reality is that? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=134.74s)]
*  I mean, we are elected to office— [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=139.3s)]
*  It sounds flip, you know? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=141.3s)]
*  It sounds flip. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=142.3s)]
*  What's that now? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=143.3s)]
*  It sounds flip. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=144.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=145.3s)]
*  It is not what a serious policymaker should be talking about, quite frankly. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=146.3s)]
*  They should be talking about how we make life better for our constituents, how we increase [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=152.62s)]
*  opportunity, how we increase freedoms, privacy, all those things that make this country the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=156.46s)]
*  greatest country in the world. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=160.38s)]
*  You, sir, have been critical of Trump's budget bill on the exclusion of any bipartisan input [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=163.06s)]
*  from Democrats, and particularly on its impact to farmers, who shouldn't have to rely on [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=168.1s)]
*  government handouts. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=173.34s)]
*  Explain how Trump's bill hurts farmers. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=175.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think it starts with his tariffs. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=178.06s)]
*  I mean, you know, people in production agriculture raise more food than we can eat in this country. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=180.9s)]
*  So we depend upon foreign countries to have reasonable markets so that we don't go broke [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=185.78s)]
*  because our markets are not paying us the cost of production. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=190.9s)]
*  That's where government subsidies come in. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=194.22000000000003s)]
*  Because of these tariffs, because they've pumped a bunch of money into the farm bill [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  for subsidies, it shows me that they're not going to do anything to do things like make [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=200.06s)]
*  these tariffs work for people in production ag. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=204.94000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, folks in production ag are the tip of the spear when it comes to trade [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=207.34s)]
*  wars. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=210.9s)]
*  We're the ones that end up on the short end of the stick. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=211.9s)]
*  And they're not going to do anything to put more competition in the marketplace, which, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  by the way, when capitalism works, you get fair prices for your products. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=218.66s)]
*  And it's good for consumers, too, I might add. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=222.9s)]
*  But what they're going to do is they're going to make us dependent upon the federal government [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=225.85999999999999s)]
*  with more subsidies. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=229.42s)]
*  There's not a farmer that I know that doesn't want to get their paycheck from the marketplace. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=230.98s)]
*  And to say, now, we're going to turn this into a socialist system, so you have to depend [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=235.18s)]
*  on me, Uncle Sam, to make a living on your farm just goes against everything that my [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=239.14s)]
*  parents taught me when I was growing up about production agriculture. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  And the bottom line is they need to take that bill back. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=249.14s)]
*  They need to take the whole bill back and rework it, because it's really bad in a whole [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=252.54s)]
*  bunch of areas. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=256.06s)]
*  But the farm bill, part of that bill that was passed by the House a week or so ago, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=257.06s)]
*  absolutely does not meet the food security needs or the needs of people in production [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=262.26s)]
*  agriculture in this country. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=267.42s)]
*  And it certainly doesn't meet the needs of our taxpayers. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=269.02s)]
*  going to increase our debt even more, which is something that we should be taking seriously. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=271.54s)]
*  And this bill does not. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=276.06s)]
*  Given the fact that Montana, though, is a very red state, I'm curious how many of your [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=278.02000000000004s)]
*  fellow farmers are sticking by Trump's measures and for how long they'll continue to do so. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=282.06s)]
*  Well, I think so far, to be honest with you, I think most of them still are. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  I think it takes time for this uncertainty in the tariff situation that Trump is, you [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=291.14000000000004s)]
*  know, putting tariffs on one day and taking tariffs off the next day. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=297.58s)]
*  That's going to impact our markets. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=302.5s)]
*  It's going to take a bit to do it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=304.09999999999997s)]
*  Soybeans, it's already happened. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=306.06s)]
*  But wheat and corn, it'll take a bit of time. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=308.38s)]
*  And I think when it starts hitting people in the wallets, they start paying attention. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=311.06s)]
*  And I just don't see any way that this is not going to start hitting farmers in the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=314.09999999999997s)]
*  wallet. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=318.86s)]
*  And here's the problem, Alex. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=319.86s)]
*  There's not a lot of profit margin in production agriculture. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=321.9s)]
*  We're going to lose a lot of farmers if we don't get some good policy and some forward [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=325.42s)]
*  thinking from the White House when it comes to raising food in this country. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=330.14000000000004s)]
*  I want to ask you a question about the Democrats' increasing indications as well of the issues [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=334.26s)]
*  which will shape the midterms. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=339.46000000000004s)]
*  You've got tariffs, the economy, presidential behavior that's interpreted as self-enrichment, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  Social Security. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=345.98s)]
*  The list goes on. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=346.98s)]
*  Is that what will help Democrats take back control of at least one chamber of Congress [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=348.06s)]
*  next year? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=352.58000000000004s)]
*  I mean, without Trump on the ticket, how much does that help Democrats? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=353.74s)]
*  Well, I think the being on the take stuff, the corruption is going to help going to help [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  Democrats. But Democrats have to step up and show that we're different. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=363.34s)]
*  I mean, that we we are much more transparent in what we do and and that, you know, we're [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=367.65999999999997s)]
*  not, you know, we're not selling crypto coins for influence, for access or any of those [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=374.46s)]
*  things. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=380.14s)]
*  I think I think the trade stuff. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=381.62s)]
*  Look, Republicans have always been the party of business. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=383.86s)]
*  I don't see how these tariffs are good for business at all. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=386.41999999999996s)]
*  And I think if Democrats put forth some good policies, some good pro-business policies, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=389.26s)]
*  I think it can really help move some people, particularly independents. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=394.82s)]
*  But I think it's also a lot of Republicans over to our side. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=399.02s)]
*  I think there's great opportunity here. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=402.14s)]
*  But for Democrats to win, they have to come up with a message that works at people's kitchen [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwD-8S7HCQA&t=403.86s)]
