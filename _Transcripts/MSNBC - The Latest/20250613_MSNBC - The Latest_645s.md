# ‘Not over’: Retired General says to expect Israeli military to be 'on the ground' in Iran
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY)
*  General Clark, this barrage of strikes seemed to take Iran by surprise. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=0.0s)]
*  And we're getting more details this morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=5.0s)]
*  The AP is reporting that Massad, Israel's intelligence unit, was able to smuggle weapons [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=6.8s)]
*  into Iran ahead of these attacks that were then used to target its defenses from within. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=11.76s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=17.94s)]
*  What does the broader attack tell you about the level of sophistication within Israel's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=18.94s)]
*  military? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=23.32s)]
*  Oh, it was extremely well done. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=24.32s)]
*  And it's not over. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=27.2s)]
*  The fact that they could get the drones in, that they could take out some of the retaliatory [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=28.88s)]
*  measures that Iran had, that they could take out remaining radars, air defense sites so [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=33.4s)]
*  that their aircraft could penetrate successfully, a very, very complex, very sophisticated operation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=38.44s)]
*  And I'm certain that the Israeli military understands that they've got to finish the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=46.32s)]
*  job now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=51.16s)]
*  So it's not just a matter of knocking on the door of Natanz. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=52.16s)]
*  You're going to have to go in there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=55.96s)]
*  You're going to have to take out everything. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=57.04s)]
*  There are a lot of other ground, other sites, many of them underground, some located in [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  positions where bombs and missiles can't get in there. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=65.04s)]
*  So I wouldn't be surprised to see Israeli teams in there on the ground in the coming [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=69.12s)]
*  days and weeks. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=73.76s)]
*  And then you're left out with this question. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=75.26s)]
*  So this was in a regime that for 45 years has insisted that its entire purpose of existence [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=77.72s)]
*  was to destroy the people of Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=84.84s)]
*  So I think if you were on the Israeli side, you'd say, we've started this, we're going [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=87.4s)]
*  to finish this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  And I think it's going to certainly an effort to end the regime change and put a much more [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  Western, more friendly, more compatible group of people in charge. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=100.84s)]
*  Wow, that's taking it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=106.0s)]
*  That is taking it to a whole new level. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=107.48s)]
*  We have heard Manjahu imply that they're going to take this to some kind of logical conclusion. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=109.92s)]
*  We don't know exactly what that is. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=115.88s)]
*  You mentioned Natanz specifically. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=117.88s)]
*  I want to let our viewers know that that is the location of Iran's main nuclear enrichment [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=119.48s)]
*  facility. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=125.12s)]
*  General Clark, let me come back to you, because as you look at the U.S. response to all this, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=126.12s)]
*  right now, President Trump has posted this morning on social media, quote, two months [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=131.6s)]
*  ago, I gave Iran a 60 day ultimatum to make a deal. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=135.52s)]
*  They should have done it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=139.84s)]
*  Today is day 61. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=141.24s)]
*  And then he also posted that the U.S. makes the best and most lethal military equipment [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=143.24s)]
*  anywhere in the world and that Israel has a lot of it with much more to come. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=147.36s)]
*  General, do you see a scenario here where the U.S. gets involved in this fight? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=152.24s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think you have to give the administration a lot of credit for moving [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  the diplomacy forward. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=164.6s)]
*  I'm sure the administration knew what Israel's plans were. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=166.6s)]
*  And I know from discussions with people in the region that our forces are there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=170.96s)]
*  We're staged. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  We're ready to protect ourselves or do much more if necessary. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  So I think it's going to come out as a classic diplomatic military, which may reach a really [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=182.44s)]
*  successful conclusion. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=191.08s)]
*  It's too early to say now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  No one's mentioned Russia in this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=194.52s)]
*  Russia and Iran have a strategic relationship. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=196.8s)]
*  Russia had earlier offered to take all of the enriched uranium out of Iran. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=200.12s)]
*  Putin has played an important role in the Democratic administration's efforts in the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  2015 agreement. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=212.24s)]
*  Russia was critical in that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  So we don't know where Russia stands on this as this goes forward. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=216.60000000000002s)]
*  As more strikes continue, as pressure builds. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=221.76s)]
*  We also haven't heard from the nations in the region. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=223.92s)]
*  Are they concerned? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=226.55999999999997s)]
*  A lot of airline traffic has been stopped. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=228.83999999999997s)]
*  Straits of Hormuz, so far as we know, are still open. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=232.6s)]
*  Oil shipments are continuing so far. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=236.32s)]
*  So this is a... [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  We're at the early stages of this in all probability now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=241.76s)]
*  Iran's nuclear facilities being a big piece of this care is, I think, concerning to so [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  many of us. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=250.48s)]
*  What type of safety concerns have arisen given that at least one of their major nuclear facilities [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=252.6s)]
*  is now compromised? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  We know the International Atomic Energy Agency is monitoring the situation, right? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=261.2s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=265.56s)]
*  The UN Watchdog, yeah, it is. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=267.96s)]
*  And it does say so far there is no sign of increased radioactive levels. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=269.76s)]
*  So that will be some reassurance. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=274.8s)]
*  You don't necessarily, when you hit a nuclear site, cause a nuclear reaction, if you like. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=280.52s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily... [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=291.6s)]
*  That's not necessarily one follows the other. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=293.04s)]
*  You can understand why people worry about that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=294.52s)]
*  But we have now Iran's president saying, a message to his nation today, that Iran's legitimate [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=297.08s)]
*  and powerful response will make Israel regret its foolish act. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=304.52s)]
*  That's what has people really most worried. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=308.6s)]
*  In this region, for example, where I am in the Gulf, many of these countries have moved, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=311.2s)]
*  shifted in recent years from an adversarial relationship with Iran to a diplomatic relationship [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=316.68s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=322.32s)]
*  But still though, just as an example, Jordan, there were reports from Jordan that some of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=323.88s)]
*  those Iranian drones were shot down. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=329.68s)]
*  And that will raise concerns that Iran might respond against some of the US partners in [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=332.76s)]
*  this region. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=339.28s)]
*  Aaron, David Miller is back with us now. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=340.28s)]
*  I think, Aaron, we have your audio fixed. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=342.4s)]
*  Just weigh in your thoughts on these strikes and the state of play in the region now. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=345.48s)]
*  I mean, look, I think this happened as a consequence of the fact that Israelis believe, as prime [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=350.76s)]
*  minister, that there would never be a better opportunity than to do this. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=356.4s)]
*  They demonstrated escalation dominance over their enemies, including the Iranians. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=361.44s)]
*  That is the ability of the Israelis to control the pace, the focus, the intensity of military [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=367.23999999999995s)]
*  action and prevent their adversaries from escalating. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=372.35999999999996s)]
*  We still haven't seen an Iranian response. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=376.0s)]
*  It took them weeks to respond. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=378.52s)]
*  And now I think their efforts coordinate are limited. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  The key factor, though, I think, is the reaction of an American president who may have had [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=385.36s)]
*  some doubts when he was briefed on this operation days before it happens while still maintaining [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=392.2s)]
*  the fiction purposefully. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=399.12s)]
*  I think that there would be a round of negotiations this Sunday, which lulled the Iranians into [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  a false sense of security. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=407.0s)]
*  This president basically, when confronted with the possibility that this could blow [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  up a negotiation, basically acquiesced and enabled the Israelis to mount this extraordinary [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=414.76s)]
*  campaign. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  And now, having succeeded the operation beyond, I think, the president's wildest expectations, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=425.12s)]
*  he's now riding the tiger. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=434.64s)]
*  So I don't expect any negotiations. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=436.08s)]
*  The president continues to say, and they're holding open the possibility that the Iranians [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=438.36s)]
*  will show up in Oman to negotiate. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=443.12s)]
*  But look, in the end, and General Clark, I think, said it pretty well, they've invested [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=445.96s)]
*  five trillion dollars in this nuclear program. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=451.44s)]
*  It has become a symbol of national prestige and honor. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=455.4s)]
*  And now it's going to become an element of national security, because when all is said [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=458.88s)]
*  and done, if this regime stays in power, I suspect it will, the Iranians will probably [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=463.04s)]
*  make a decision to go all out in an effort to weaponize. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=468.08s)]
*  And the Americans in these early are going to have to figure out over time how to deal [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=472.4s)]
*  with that. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  So clearly, Aaron, you see it a little bit differently than General Clark does. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=476.79999999999995s)]
*  And General Clark sees this leading to regime change in Iran. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=480.52s)]
*  That is the logical conclusion of days and potentially weeks more conflict. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=484.08s)]
*  Aaron, how do you see this resolving if it isn't regime change? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=489.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, look, this is a war between two countries that do not share contiguous borders. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  The amount of damage that Israel can do, even though great, is separated by 1200 kilometers. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  And the amount of damage the Iranians can do to the Israelis is limited as well. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=507.44s)]
*  If the Iranians choose just to respond against Israel, do not attack American bases in Iraq, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=512.16s)]
*  do not go after Saudi oil installations or American forces in the Gulf. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=519.52s)]
*  I mean, I know this sounds counterintuitive, because everybody thinks we're on the verge [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  of a major, major regional war. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=528.08s)]
*  I don't see that happening. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=530.88s)]
*  It may well be. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=532.6400000000001s)]
*  You are going to have a war. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=534.32s)]
*  It's going to continue for months as the Iranians plot, try to triangulate using asymmetrical [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=535.5200000000001s)]
*  power and terror to attack Israeli targets. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  But I suspect this regime, having survived since 79, will likely continue in power. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=545.6s)]
*  And what you're going to have, I think, is now a forever war waged on any number of fronts [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=553.12s)]
*  with the Iranians not having a whole lot of cards to play against an Israel backed by [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=560.0s)]
*  the United States. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=567.92s)]
*  I might add the Americans deployed F-15s to Jordan in an effort to help intercept drones with [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=568.72s)]
*  special packages of interceptors. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=577.28s)]
*  So at this National Security Council meeting, I'm sure the president is in order of priority. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=579.2s)]
*  How do you protect Americans? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=585.04s)]
*  How do you defend Israel? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=586.96s)]
*  And how do you better integrate a regional response to whatever the Iranians may intend? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=588.72s)]
*  So this is a very long movie. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=595.52s)]
*  I rarely disagree with General Clark. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=598.16s)]
*  I think the odd regime change right now could be wrong. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=600.56s)]
*  It could happen. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=605.92s)]
*  And when it happens, it might happen very quickly. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=606.88s)]
*  I'm not sure we're going to be faced with an Iranian regime that's any different than [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=609.6s)]
*  the one we see right now. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=615.6s)]
*  If anything, it may become more militarized and more influenced by the Iranian Revolutionary [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=616.96s)]
*  Guard Corps or the MOLIS. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4pahmjPaY&t=622.0s)]
