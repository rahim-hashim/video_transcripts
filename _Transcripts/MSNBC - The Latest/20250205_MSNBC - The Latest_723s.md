# Trump's triple loss: Trade 'war' surrender, court defeat, Mideast occupation debacle
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q)
*  Right now, we're following this foreign policy development, which the world is taking seriously, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  tops many front pages, even as its core premise is unserious and would be costly for the U.S. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=6.58s)]
*  and is rejected by experts and leaders in the United States in both parties. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=14.22s)]
*  The U.S. has played a large military role in the Middle East since invading Iraq and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=18.14s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=21.98s)]
*  Those costly occupations all began when hawkish conservative Republicans initially started [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=23.4s)]
*  the Iraq War. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=31.159999999999997s)]
*  And it was first opposed by some liberals, you might recall, like Howard Dean, who actually [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=32.16s)]
*  joins us later tonight, later by top Democrats like Obama. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=36.48s)]
*  And then after United States majorities did turn on that war and occupation, which is [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=40.8s)]
*  back in the news tonight, only then did Donald Trump start following the lead. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=44.78s)]
*  In fact, he attacked his rivals, the Bushes on that point and the hawkish Republican foreign [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=49.04s)]
*  policy over the years. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=53.4s)]
*  Ultimately, Trump did shift GOP foreign policy against some of those hawkish records by the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=55.12s)]
*  2024 campaign. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  He was routinely vowing to end foreign wars and U.S. spending blood or treasure abroad [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=62.94s)]
*  and especially in the Middle East. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=67.84s)]
*  Let me just tell you upfront, because I try to keep it very direct here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=70.88s)]
*  Many voters believed him. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=74.56s)]
*  Many Trump voters believed that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=76.58s)]
*  They accepted his claimed policy against U.S. involvement in occupation as a positive. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=78.5s)]
*  And we heard that in surveys and interviews. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=83.78s)]
*  Now two weeks into returning to the White House, President Trump is floating a plan, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=86.94s)]
*  however unseriously, which breaks that vow. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  His comments alongside the Israeli leader about plunging the U.S. into another Middle [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=95.1s)]
*  East occupation in an area that everyone knows, a region that could be as dangerous and complex [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=99.14s)]
*  as Iraq, if not more so, is the story that matters. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=104.34s)]
*  Even though I'm going to show you why, it is not exactly how it looks and people should [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=109.38000000000001s)]
*  be careful overreacting. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=113.30000000000001s)]
*  Trump saying that under his leadership, quote, the U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=116.30000000000001s)]
*  Here's that statement alongside memory lane. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=121.34s)]
*  The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=126.12s)]
*  It is not the duty of U.S. troops to solve ancient conflicts in faraway lands. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=130.86s)]
*  That is the contrast. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=137.78s)]
*  And for some time, he has very publicly gone after anyone affiliated with those kind of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=138.78s)]
*  foreign conflicts, especially in the Middle East. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=144.78s)]
*  Obviously, the war in Iraq was a big fat mistake. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=150.26000000000002s)]
*  The war in Iraq, we spent two trillion dollars, thousands of lives. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=155.94000000000003s)]
*  We should have never been in Iraq. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=159.64s)]
*  We have destabilized the Middle East. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=161.61999999999998s)]
*  You know, they're all war hawks when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=163.72s)]
*  oh, gee, Will, let's send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=167.76s)]
*  Let's see, they're all war hawks sitting in Washington saying, let's send 10,000 troops [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=175.44s)]
*  over there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=180.27999999999997s)]
*  I guess you have your war hawk who's in Washington, who's talking about sending troops to occupy [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  of all places at all times the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=188.84s)]
*  Now let me keep it real with you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=193.8s)]
*  For Trump supporters, the choice on a day like today is to believe him now and acknowledge [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=196.76s)]
*  everything you just heard. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=201.52s)]
*  The past claims have proven false or to still not believe him now, to say this isn't really [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=202.52s)]
*  it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  This is disingenuous rhetoric and it's designed for some later special purpose. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  These remarks have managed to play poorly for both the Palestinian community, which [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=214.56s)]
*  wants a homeland, and the Israeli community, which coming since October 7th in this war [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=219.72s)]
*  wants to make sure there is some security over there. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=226.18s)]
*  The Jerusalem Post reporting this just isn't even remotely feasible. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=229.36s)]
*  Experts say the plan is unworkable. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=234.36s)]
*  Some are throwing Trump this sort of bone of saying, well, since it can't work and it's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=236.04s)]
*  a bad idea and nobody really wants it, maybe it's just some fake special threat that would [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=239.12s)]
*  not be enacted, another so-called gambit or tactic. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=244.52s)]
*  Okay, I'm familiar, what with paying attention to the news, I'm familiar with that kind of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  post-hoc rationalization of something somebody said. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=254.68s)]
*  But let's just be serious, even in these somewhat unserious moments. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=258.76s)]
*  Even negotiating claims have consequences. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=263.76s)]
*  That's why being a peace or hostage negotiator is a tough job. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=267.12s)]
*  And Trump officials on cue are today walking this back. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  The New York Times with the diplomatic Trump officials try to walk back Gaza takeover plan. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=277.4s)]
*  This is not what three-dimensional geopolitical chess sounds like. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=284.35999999999996s)]
*  It's more like cleanup on aisle one or a lot of chess pieces knocked over in a losing game. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=292.0s)]
*  And it's far from a doctrine where the US uses power to set goals and limits that other [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  countries follow. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=301.32s)]
*  Trump's own aides are retracting this policy statement. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=303.76s)]
*  That means something very simple that will matter for the years to come. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=308.8s)]
*  To agree with Trump today, you have to disagree with him yesterday. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=313.26s)]
*  And this matters around the world. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=319.2s)]
*  The broader theme here is that if you confront this, it may actually help everyone dealing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=321.4s)]
*  with the Trump administration. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=326.8s)]
*  There's no sign that this stuff is going to change overnight, this approach. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=327.88s)]
*  Consider that today, Wednesday, Trump is softening those big Gaza claims from yesterday. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=333.16s)]
*  On Monday, he backed down from his big terror threats from the weekend. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  May not be America first, but it does seem like talk first and then think later and then [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  maybe take back what you said. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=349.24s)]
*  On the tariff war, that strangely gives Canada and Mexico more leverage, which is the opposite [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=352.48s)]
*  of what Donald Trump said his plan and strategy was. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=358.32s)]
*  Again, not three dimensional chess because it shows these other countries how you face [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=361.48s)]
*  Trump down, get him to narrow his demands, walk it all back. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=367.24s)]
*  Just as many of his own allies think he squandered the Mideast meeting yesterday or take immigration, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  something where he and his team says this is a big deal, big priority. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=376.12s)]
*  He's talked about mass deportations. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=379.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=382.2s)]
*  But he hasn't paired that talk, some might say bluster, with the federal governing planning [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=383.84s)]
*  or the congressionally needed funding to get near the numbers that he wanted. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=390.44s)]
*  I'm going to follow the evidence and the data with you, not the rest of it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=395.67999999999995s)]
*  So we will show you here reporting on these first two weeks. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=400.08s)]
*  It could change, but in the first two weeks, the number of daily ICE arrests are about [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  where they were under Obama, a Democratic White House. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=405.44s)]
*  Americans have been quietly released for lack of detention capacity, meaning they haven't [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=409.48s)]
*  yet done the actual governing work with the Congress of getting the funding and then the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=417.36s)]
*  building to increase capacity. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=421.76s)]
*  So they're now doing the thing that they used to complain about, releasing the people back [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=423.6s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=428.24s)]
*  I'm not telling you what to think about that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=429.24s)]
*  You can say that's good, bad, or in between, but that's what's happening. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=430.48s)]
*  Against that backdrop is what you see on your screen. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=434.0s)]
*  You will know those kind of facts, Obama-level immigration policy, catch and release, as [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=436.02s)]
*  some called it in political rhetoric. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=440.97999999999996s)]
*  You'll know that if you read or follow factual news. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=443.02s)]
*  If you don't, and I recognize the paradox, whether you're watching this live or on YouTube, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=446.29999999999995s)]
*  if you are watching this, you're watching the beat, MSNBC factual news, but for others [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=450.85999999999996s)]
*  who aren't, they might only see what I am giving you a little peek of, the well-known [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=454.65999999999997s)]
*  fact that you got to do horse patrols, right? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  You might only see the PR horse. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=463.96s)]
*  We'll put it back up if we have it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=465.35999999999996s)]
*  I know I left it up for a while, but we'll re-rack when we can. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=467.84s)]
*  Yeah, they're playing that on Fox. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=470.91999999999996s)]
*  I just want you to know if you get in a conversation with someone and you say, well, they're still [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=472.91999999999996s)]
*  doing the so-called catch and release and Obama-level deportations, you might run into [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=475.79999999999995s)]
*  another person in the country who says, well, I saw the horse patrol on Fox. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=479.52s)]
*  I'm sure you did. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=483.88s)]
*  That's the optics. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=486.64s)]
*  Now, depending on the issue, many may welcome what I'm showing you is a problem in how Trump [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=487.64s)]
*  and his aides are governing, a competence issue. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=493.68s)]
*  Republicans don't really want Trump to succeed on a new Mideast occupation, so if he's brainstorming [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=499.36s)]
*  that on the fly and then it fails, they may actually like that type of incompetence in [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=505.44s)]
*  government. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=511.16s)]
*  Again, not three-dimensional chess. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=512.16s)]
*  Liberals might not want Trump to effectively supersize deportations, and so they might be [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=514.64s)]
*  happy with this level of incompetence. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=518.84s)]
*  The Trump show, as always, is different than the results of Trump in charge. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=521.36s)]
*  And I am not saying, and we are not reporting, and we don't have the evidence to substantiate [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=526.6800000000001s)]
*  the claim that it's just been two weeks of the horse ride-alongs. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=530.84s)]
*  There are also, against this backdrop, these serious things happening. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=535.08s)]
*  An informed citizenry and an informed world needs to know that Trump did issue irreversible [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  pardons to violent January 6 convicts, including those who attacked police. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=545.04s)]
*  He did it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=549.72s)]
*  It's true, and it's not going away. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=550.76s)]
*  It is a part of the danger that we face in the United States right now because he's freed [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=551.76s)]
*  and immunized under federal policy these violent people. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=557.4s)]
*  He is giving billionaire Elon Musk these powers. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=561.36s)]
*  We showed you that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=563.6s)]
*  Today, his DOJ is launching a new program that could lead to revenge investigations [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=564.6s)]
*  and indictments of people who held Trump accountable when he was a citizen. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  Federal policies have changed under Trump and already are having the intended effect [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=574.22s)]
*  of hospitals denying health care to individuals, sometimes based on their chosen or lived identity. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=577.88s)]
*  Just like his judges from the last term, the first term, did use their power to ultimately [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=584.04s)]
*  overturn about 50 years of precedent and changing abortion rights in this country. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=588.6s)]
*  There are many real things also happening against the optics and the incompetence. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=592.64s)]
*  Our colleague Rachel Maddow recently focusing on this aspect of the competing realities. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=597.76s)]
*  It doesn't mean that they don't have the worst and most malicious intentions. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=604.44s)]
*  They clearly do. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=607.8800000000001s)]
*  But it gives light to the fact that they're just not that good at any of the things they're [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=609.48s)]
*  trying to do. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=614.2800000000001s)]
*  That level of stupidity has the benefit of making us less intimidated by them because [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=615.5600000000001s)]
*  they're being dumb. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=621.72s)]
*  It also has the benefit of emboldening people to push back. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=623.0s)]
*  That's just one part of the dynamics here. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=628.5200000000001s)]
*  And what's funny that you know from politics, and the Trump MAGA era has been really intense, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=631.44s)]
*  supersized politics, but what you know from it is sometimes there's this strange meeting [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=636.72s)]
*  where the empty threats of an extremist are met by their foes saying, see, this proves [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=642.2s)]
*  their extremism. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=647.32s)]
*  And you could substitute any word in that sentence just about. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=648.72s)]
*  Their incompetence, their bluster, even at times, I would only say it when the facts [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=652.6400000000001s)]
*  support it, their apparent stupidity about a topic. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=657.4000000000001s)]
*  Like whether anyone in the Middle East, Israeli, Palestinian, Saudi, Egypt, wants the United [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=661.04s)]
*  States to come do another occupation, let alone the American people and our brave men [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=669.4s)]
*  and women in uniform. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=673.7199999999999s)]
*  So you can say all of that, and you get this circle where the foes say, see, it proves [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=674.7199999999999s)]
*  how extreme he is. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=679.4s)]
*  And the truth is complicated because on one hand it does, but on the other hand, it's [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=681.4399999999999s)]
*  noise about things that aren't happening because they are not good enough and common enough [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=687.08s)]
*  to execute them, while a bunch of other things are also happening. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=691.8000000000001s)]
*  I didn't say it'd be easy. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=697.76s)]
*  I just said we would follow it together as factually as we can. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3x7iuQs3Q&t=699.36s)]
