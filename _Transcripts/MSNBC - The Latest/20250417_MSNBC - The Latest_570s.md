# FSU Shooting Update: Police say one person is in custody
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw)
*  We are following the breaking news of a shooting on the campus of Florida State University. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=0.0s)]
*  Now it is still very much a fluid situation with local police and the FBI on the scene [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=5.44s)]
*  among other law enforcement. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=10.06s)]
*  But here's what we know. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=12.4s)]
*  At least six people have been hospitalized. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=13.4s)]
*  No word of any fatalities among those six. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=16.52s)]
*  One is in critical condition. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=19.76s)]
*  The rest are serious. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=21.1s)]
*  One person has been taken into custody. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=23.54s)]
*  Our own Tom Winter called it a relatively self-contained situation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=26.72s)]
*  Police have told him there are no indications as of now that this is a large-scale event. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=31.479999999999997s)]
*  We do know that the incident happened near the campus student union. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  A shelter-in-place order was issued for the campus. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  Classes have been canceled for the day. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=44.4s)]
*  And we just got new video. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Here it is showing the moments right after that shooting alert went out. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  You can see students' backpacks on sprinting down the street as sirens blare loudly in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=53.06s)]
*  the background and emergency responders come to the scene. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=58.46s)]
*  There's another chilling new video. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=62.82s)]
*  It shows the situation that unfolded inside of a campus building. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=64.74000000000001s)]
*  Lines of students walking down the hall. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  They've all got their hands in the air. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=71.54s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=74.22s)]
*  Here with me on set, former senior FBI official Christopher O'Leary and NBC's Emily Aketa, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=78.28s)]
*  who has been following this story for us. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=83.84s)]
*  Emily, bring us up to date on any other information that we know about this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=86.16s)]
*  Yeah, so as you just mentioned, within the last few minutes, we are learning that one [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=89.84s)]
*  suspect is in custody. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=93.2s)]
*  But I can tell you what is happening right now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=94.92s)]
*  Law enforcement continuing to go building to building, door to door, to make sure that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=96.64s)]
*  there are no other threats and to make sure there are no other victims in this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=100.66s)]
*  Also happening right now, the nearby hospital continuing to actively receiving patients [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=104.28s)]
*  as we see the number of victims continue to climb. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=109.16s)]
*  The latest number, six people injured and Tallahassee Memorial Health Care telling us [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=112.48s)]
*  that at least one person is in critical condition. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=116.52s)]
*  The rest of those injuries in serious condition. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=119.26s)]
*  As you mentioned, we still don't know if anyone has died in the wake of this incident that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=121.42s)]
*  happens near the Student Union, which is the heart of this sprawling campus, nearly 500 [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=126.32s)]
*  acres in the heart of Tallahassee. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=131.52s)]
*  The Student Union with multiple floors. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=133.88s)]
*  It's a gathering place, a community center for not just students, but also faculty. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=135.72s)]
*  You can see the footage showing the chaos on the scene on the ground there as students [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=140.04s)]
*  running from the scene, even seen running through traffic there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=144.04s)]
*  It sits between two pretty busy roadways. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=147.6s)]
*  One student described seeing a student being carried out on a stretcher, she said. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=150.4s)]
*  Also some people being transported, carried in office chairs. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=154.74s)]
*  This all comes since the first alert that we got from FSU coming just right after 12 [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=158.28s)]
*  o'clock noon, 1201 saying an active shooter has been reported in the area of Student Union. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=163.6s)]
*  Police are on scene or on the way. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=169.2s)]
*  Continue to seek shelter and await further instructions. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=171.6s)]
*  Lock and stay away from all doors and windows and be prepared to take additional protective [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=174.36s)]
*  measures in terms of those alerts. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=178.12s)]
*  At last check, the shelter in place appears to still be intact, though, as we've reported [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=179.56s)]
*  one person is in custody. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=184.88s)]
*  Other universities in the area also saying they're monitoring the situation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=186.4s)]
*  So Chris, let's take these one by one and let's start with the alleged shooter or at [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=190.0s)]
*  least the suspect, one person taken into custody. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=198.96s)]
*  Assuming, and we don't know anything about this person's condition, but assuming that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=199.96s)]
*  they're able to talk to this person, what are they doing? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=204.72s)]
*  And assuming they know the identity, what are they doing? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=207.8s)]
*  First of all, they're trying to positively identify the individual, you know, who they [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=210.88s)]
*  are. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=214.12s)]
*  Do they have affiliation with the campus? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=215.12s)]
*  Do they have other connections that we should be concerned about? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=216.3s)]
*  Is there a link to terrorism, whether international or domestic? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  What's the ideology? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  What drove them to do this? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  Or is it a grievance that the individual had that built towards mobilization, towards violence? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=225.3s)]
*  So they're going to be looking at that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=230.5s)]
*  They'll also look to interview the individual to find out if there is some kind of ongoing [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=232.62s)]
*  threat. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  Was he acting alone or is this something that we should still be concerned about? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  Because as has been reported, there are some reports out there that there may have been [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=244.5s)]
*  more than one shooter, which is fairly common in these events because the victims tend to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=248.1s)]
*  think there's more than one individual carrying out this violence. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=254.18s)]
*  So I've been involved in responses to school shootings, and you're often looking for additional [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=258.3s)]
*  subjects, which is why all the law enforcement that has surged to the scene is clearing every [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=263.86s)]
*  room on that campus. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=270.22s)]
*  To number one, look for any individuals who might also be involved, any tools that are [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=271.7s)]
*  used. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=276.97999999999996s)]
*  And I say make an assumption that it's a he, that the shooter used during the attack, but [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=277.97999999999996s)]
*  also looking for victims or individuals just hiding and still sheltering in place. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=284.62s)]
*  What would they have had to know or what do they have to know to say, law enforcement [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  officials, to our Tom Winter, we believe the situation is contained, using that word contained? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=292.9s)]
*  Well, I would think they would have cleared the school in its entirety and do a secondary [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=297.82000000000005s)]
*  search. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=302.98s)]
*  So you do an initial clear, a tactical clear. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=303.98s)]
*  Of that building? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=305.82000000000005s)]
*  Of the entirety. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=307.82000000000005s)]
*  Entire campus. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=308.82000000000005s)]
*  Of the campus. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=309.82000000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's really, and it's a massive campus. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=310.82000000000005s)]
*  You cannot make any assumptions in this case. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=312.92s)]
*  Obviously, you're going to prioritize with where the incident happened, but then you're [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  going to go out in concentric circles and look at every room that you can get access [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  to and it has to be thorough. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=323.32000000000005s)]
*  It's highly unusual for someone not to have a footprint, either on social media or some [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=326.74s)]
*  sort of electronic footprint. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=332.21999999999997s)]
*  How easy is it generally to get access to that kind of information once you know who [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=334.53999999999996s)]
*  the person is? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=337.9s)]
*  Fairly easy. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=338.9s)]
*  So again, finding out what the ideology is that'll help drive investigators to certain [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=339.9s)]
*  social media platforms or chat rooms to find out what they were talking about. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=344.94s)]
*  Also getting access to their actual devices, whether handheld or home computers, getting [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=350.26s)]
*  search warrants to be able to go into those things. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=355.3s)]
*  And we can really exploit all that information and get a pretty good picture of who they [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=357.74s)]
*  are and what you're open to do this. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=361.46s)]
*  Dr. Patel, listen, we have a major metropolitan hospital there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=363.14s)]
*  Talk about the training and their ability to respond to an emergency situation like [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=368.38s)]
*  this. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=374.38s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, sadly, this is something that we're used to, and especially in like a level [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=375.38s)]
*  one trauma center like Tallahassee Memorial, where we've heard that many of the victims [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=379.42s)]
*  have been taken and that is shifting into kind of rapid disaster protocols and also [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=383.82s)]
*  coordinating with law enforcement officials. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=388.82s)]
*  That's something that hospitals like PMH have become quickly adept at. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=390.7s)]
*  And that happens quickly in the sense that they know that the doctors and nurses and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=394.82s)]
*  teams responding have to triage patients in order to kind of make sure that they have [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=398.85999999999996s)]
*  a high survival rate, meaning they will quickly assess, is this the type of injury where [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=404.14s)]
*  even if they're in critical condition, that they would be able to likely have a favorable [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=408.73999999999995s)]
*  outcome because that time spent on that patient means that that's time they can't spend on [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=412.7s)]
*  another patient. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=418.14s)]
*  So that's actually what's happening, kind of literally kind of minute by minute assessment [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=419.14s)]
*  of the patients, their status. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=423.02s)]
*  And then I would just say that a lot of what happens inside the hospitals in the emergency [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=425.06s)]
*  rooms in the area around the emergency room is just everybody who can't be anywhere near [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=428.02s)]
*  the campus coming to the hospital to kind of find out if their loved one is part of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=432.65999999999997s)]
*  the team that's been taken in, if their loved one has made any contact. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=437.41999999999996s)]
*  And I think this is where there's that critical coordination with law enforcement. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=441.78000000000003s)]
*  You could imagine being a friend, family or parent that has someone at that school. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=445.66s)]
*  You can't get in touch with that student or faculty member. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=449.58s)]
*  You can only imagine the emotions and you can't go near the campus, as you heard. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=453.22s)]
*  So you do end up tending to be a lot of what we end up doing is kind of seeing people in the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=457.18s)]
*  waiting rooms outside the hospitals. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=461.90000000000003s)]
*  And then what we see is kind of weeks to months later, unfortunately, all the mental health [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=464.22s)]
*  effects and it might even be just people listening to our words right now where this is [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=468.90000000000003s)]
*  sending shockwaves to people who have been going through this. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=473.02000000000004s)]
*  As you know, so many mass shooting events, so many active shooter events that we've seen [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=475.58000000000004s)]
*  just in this year alone are kind of reminding people and kind of bringing up those [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=480.18s)]
*  memories. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=484.14s)]
*  Yeah, and it brings to mind the EMS, the emergency responders who are medically trained [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=484.94s)]
*  because I was talking to a student earlier who was with he estimated about 40 other [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=490.1s)]
*  students and he said he was very calm, but not everybody who was with him was. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=494.42s)]
*  He talked about people having panic attacks and so they are trained obviously in a [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=499.34000000000003s)]
*  situation like that. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=504.06s)]
*  They're on the ground when they went outside. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=504.98s)]
*  He said he saw people being tended to by EMS who I guess for better but also for worse [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=507.66s)]
*  because of the situation are trained to deal with these kinds of situations. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=514.58s)]
*  They are. And so are law enforcement, by the way. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=519.34s)]
*  This is something that has become kind of a standard for training in law enforcement, EMS, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=521.3399999999999s)]
*  first responders of all kinds. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=527.02s)]
*  And you're starting to see on some schools also having the faculty and staff trained to do [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=529.06s)]
*  the same because it's your response. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=533.2199999999999s)]
*  We kind of say this in disaster and trauma settings, our ability to remain calm kind of [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=535.8199999999999s)]
*  helps everyone around us remain calm. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=540.9399999999999s)]
*  That's a skill that you have to learn. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=542.8599999999999s)]
*  And as you mentioned, for better or for worse, this is something that everybody who's on [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=544.74s)]
*  scene has to have experience with. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLzT2WB4Fpw&t=548.38s)]
