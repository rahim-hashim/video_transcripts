# 'How can that continually happen?’ United CEO calls out FAA amid Newark chaos
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc)
*  NBC's Marquise Francis is live at Newark International, also with me, former acting FAA administrator [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=0.0s)]
*  and Archer Chief Safety Officer Billy Nolan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=6.2s)]
*  Marquise, for nine straight days now, travelers have faced massive delays at Newark. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=9.4s)]
*  I just got a text from a friend who said her flight today was canceled. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  What's it like there right now? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=18.56s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, I mean, what's been the epicenter of an aviation nightmare, as you mentioned, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=20.56s)]
*  over the last two weeks with hundreds of canceled flights, as well as delays that extended hours [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=25.96s)]
*  and more. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  Today, it's fairly pleasant. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=32.2s)]
*  You know, similar to Maggie in Chicago, as I turn around, the lines to go through security [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=34.24s)]
*  are actually fairly short. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=38.32s)]
*  And I just looked behind me just a minute ago, and you can get through in about five [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=39.32s)]
*  minutes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Now, this pales to comparison to the last few days, where there's been hundreds or even [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  thousands of cancellations and delays all over the country, but especially here in Newark. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=48.32s)]
*  And of course, this coincides with that Real ID requirement today, where people have to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=54.72s)]
*  have that Real ID enhanced license. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=59.8s)]
*  But so far, so good here in Newark this afternoon. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=61.96s)]
*  Marquise, thank you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=65.56s)]
*  So Billy, let's start with the question on everyone's mind. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=67.12s)]
*  Is it still safe to fly into and out of Newark right now? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=69.68s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=72.8s)]
*  So, Chris, thanks for having me on. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=73.8s)]
*  Bottom line up front, it is absolutely safe to fly. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=75.24s)]
*  Yet our system could be more resilient than it is today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=79.0s)]
*  We've got a legacy air transportation system. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  In some cases, we're kind of running three different ones with some legacy equipment, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=86.28s)]
*  copper wiring, so paper strips in some places. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=91.84s)]
*  So this is one where I just tip my hat to Secretary Duffy for the work he's done and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=96.56s)]
*  the leadership that he is exhibiting to FAA Administrator Chris Rosalau and the team. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=102.96s)]
*  There's much work to be done. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=108.8s)]
*  It's recognized by the industry, it's recognized by the Congress. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=110.4s)]
*  I was in a luncheon with Senator Cruz earlier in the year, just after the horrific crash [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=114.2s)]
*  in January. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=120.2s)]
*  And he's committed and the Senate Commerce Committee is committed to getting the funding [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=121.72s)]
*  that the FAA needs. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=126.16s)]
*  On the House side, House TNI, Sam Gray, Rick Larson are equally committed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=127.68s)]
*  So now's the time to really lean in and give America the best air traffic control system [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=131.88s)]
*  that it deserves. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  Understood, but we're looking at a process that could take not days, not weeks, not months, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=140.44s)]
*  but years. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=145.28s)]
*  And in the meantime, let's take safety off of the table. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=146.84s)]
*  And I think that's a some people have have said they just not going to fly into and out [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=150.44s)]
*  of Newark. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=155.64s)]
*  But if you need to get somewhere, if you're going to your sister's wedding, if you have [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=156.56s)]
*  a vacation, whatever the need is and you don't have any flexibility at all, is it smart to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  fly out of Newark right now? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=168.48s)]
*  Let me just say, look, you know, the biggest airline in Europe, of course, is United. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=170.96s)]
*  I know Scott Kirby very well, the CEO. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=176.04s)]
*  He and his team run a phenomenal airline. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=178.84s)]
*  Is it an opportunity for us to go take a look at how, you know, Newark is a, you know, it's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=181.24s)]
*  a category three, I'm sorry, category two airport where those slots are voluntary. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=187.4s)]
*  And so sometimes does everyone adhere to them as they should? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=193.52s)]
*  Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don't, to be quite honest. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=197.32s)]
*  Is it time to take that to a higher level where that is a more rigid process and that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=200.04s)]
*  the slots that are there are the slots that you must use? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=206.28s)]
*  Now, this reduces the level of the amount of traffic into and out of Newark, but it could [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=209.76s)]
*  also free up some of the congestion that we're seeing. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=216.32s)]
*  Newark's a good airport. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=219.28s)]
*  It's got some structural issues. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=220.72s)]
*  It's got runway construction and all of those just sort of come together. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=222.44s)]
*  It just means that more and more Americans are flying and we've just got to do better [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=226.84s)]
*  in terms of this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=231.32s)]
*  Now, there are some near term things you can do. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=232.32s)]
*  Can I interrupt you for just a second? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  And I'm sorry that the guy you just talked about, the president of United Airlines, just [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=235.8s)]
*  put out a letter that is more than a page long. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=242.4s)]
*  I'm going to read you a key part of it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=246.8s)]
*  In ideal weather, he says, with full staffing and with perfectly functioning technology, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=249.28s)]
*  The FAA tells us that the airport can only handle 77 flights per hour. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=254.92s)]
*  And yet the FAA regularly approves schedules of 80 plus flights per hour almost every day [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=260.76s)]
*  between 3 and 8 p.m. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  This math doesn't work, especially when there is weather, staffing issues or technology [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=268.96s)]
*  breakdowns. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=274.88s)]
*  The airspace, taxiways and runways get back up and gridlock occurs. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=275.88s)]
*  And then he asked the question, how can this continually happen at EWR Newark? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=282.2s)]
*  Is there an answer for that? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=288.28s)]
*  There is an answer in that it cannot continue at this rate. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=289.92s)]
*  Otherwise we will continue to suffer the kind of delays that you're seeing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=292.96s)]
*  Now some of this, of course, is, you know, can be attributed to some equipment breakdown, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=297.28s)]
*  that level of redundancy that we need that Secretary Duffy is working on. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  But Scott makes an excellent point and it's something for certainly for DOT and FAA to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=305.64s)]
*  look at that says, are we, you know, what is that number? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=310.6s)]
*  Is it time to be again more controlling there? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  That sometimes means less choice, but it improves the level of efficiency there. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=318.44s)]
*  So I'm not the point person, but I do think that that's a valid argument being made and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=323.88s)]
*  it's something worth looking into. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=328.68s)]
*  So he talks about something specifically. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=330.34000000000003s)]
*  And so I want you to explain it to folks because he said one of the things that has to be done [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=332.58000000000004s)]
*  to make sure that EWR, that Newark functions well between now and the time when everyone [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=337.88s)]
*  hopes that the shortages and these technical problems get fixed, return EWR to a level [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=344.2s)]
*  three slot controlled airport. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=350.46s)]
*  This is the only way to achieve 77 flights per hour. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=353.62s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=358.32s)]
*  What that means is that today, as I stated earlier, what that means is that it's a category [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=359.84s)]
*  two today. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=365.47999999999996s)]
*  So that means that while there are some level controls that the carriers there, they do [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=366.82s)]
*  that on a voluntary basis. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=371.02s)]
*  So someone decides to fudge, if you will, and do more than their allocated number. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=372.92s)]
*  There's no, there's no, there's no penalty for that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=379.52s)]
*  So I think what's been argued here is should that the FAA and the DOT, should they take [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=383.82s)]
*  a look? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=388.65999999999997s)]
*  Is it time to say, while we get through this construction, this phase until we just got [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=389.65999999999997s)]
*  better efficiency to go to a category three, which then has an absolute number of slots [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=394.46s)]
*  and that you can't go above that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=401.06s)]
*  And so I did, this is, this is really what, and what Scott is advocating for. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=403.02s)]
*  Now you put that on top of what is being called out. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=407.82s)]
*  15 billions we're hearing, we're hearing some different numbers. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=410.78s)]
*  Could be 15, could be $30 billion. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=413.21999999999997s)]
*  It's an opportunity to work on the controllers, work on infrastructure, work on that, work [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=415.47999999999996s)]
*  on efficiency. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=420.58s)]
*  There's some great minds out there doing AI, you know, that could help AI decision making. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=421.7s)]
*  So all of these things are things that we could and should be looking at. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=427.5s)]
*  We'll certainly hear from the secretary tomorrow and see where his thoughts are. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=432.5s)]
*  But this is truly a moment where we should come together and give America the best air [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=436.97999999999996s)]
*  or traffic control system in the world. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=442.14s)]
*  And I should say that one of the things that Scott Kirby writes, and they're drastically [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=444.26s)]
*  reducing, or at least seriously reducing the number of flights that they are flying. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=448.82s)]
*  He says in short, neither the FAA nor United Pilots will ever compromise on safety. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=453.18s)]
*  Billy Nolan, thank you for helping us work through this. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=458.34s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=460.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRXpEc99Mc&t=478.7s)]
