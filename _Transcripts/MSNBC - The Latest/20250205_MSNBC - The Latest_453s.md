# 'Absolutely ridiculous and inhumane': Trump blasted for calling Gaza 'Riviera of the Middle East'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM)
*  Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Gregory Meeks of New York, the ranking member of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=0.0s)]
*  Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=4.32s)]
*  We'll keep monitoring what the speaker is saying right now, but I want to get your reaction [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=5.44s)]
*  to what he's already said on the record and the fact that if this were to move forward, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=9.96s)]
*  this idea that President Trump has thrown out there, it would require U.S. troops, it [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=15.84s)]
*  sounds like, going into Gaza. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=20.36s)]
*  At least he's not ruling that out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=22.44s)]
*  What is your reaction to all of this? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=24.22s)]
*  It's absolutely ridiculous. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=26.44s)]
*  It is something that I think on its face is contradictory of what the presidents have [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=28.44s)]
*  even said. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=35.08s)]
*  As you said, sending troops into Gaza, American troops, does not make sense. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=36.08s)]
*  Then to remove people from their homelands, you know, that seems, it's just absolutely [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=41.24s)]
*  ridiculous and incredible and inhumane in talking, not talking to any of our allies, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=49.92s)]
*  Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, any in the other areas, that does not make sense. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=55.52s)]
*  So it's again a president that is talking off the top of his head, although I was concerned [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  because it looks as though he was reading from some papers, so someone is advising him [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=69.44s)]
*  in a very bad way. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=74.48s)]
*  I don't know whether that's Elon Musk or someone else in that regard, but there's very various [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=75.84s)]
*  dangerous things that are taking place and coming out of his mouth. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=80.68s)]
*  This is one of them, to say that the United States is going to just take over Gaza and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=84.96s)]
*  you're going to see luxury condos and things of that nature, not thinking about the group [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  of people when it's their homeland and how we're working together to make and have a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  two-state solution so that we can have a real peace in the Middle East. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=101.0s)]
*  We should be talking about how we maintain the ceasefire. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  That's what we should be focused on right now, the returning of the hostages, trying [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  is not in control of any government. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=113.24s)]
*  There's a lot of serious business that needs to be taking place right now, and we are now [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=115.24s)]
*  distracted from that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=119.96s)]
*  That should be the conversation that he should be having with Prime Minister Netanyahu right [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=121.88s)]
*  now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=126.44s)]
*  We've got a second phase of the peace agreement that's supposed to take place, and Netanyahu [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=127.44s)]
*  has indicated some indications he may not want to continue. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  That's the kind of serious dialogue that should be taking place between the president of the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=136.8s)]
*  United States and the prime minister of Israel right now as we speak, not talking about going [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=141.04s)]
*  in and taking land and sending in U.S. troops. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=146.16s)]
*  It just does not make any common sense. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=151.28s)]
*  Congressman, we have the sound now with Speaker Johnson talking about this just moments ago. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=153.84s)]
*  I want you to listen to it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  Yesterday I think was greeted by surprise by many, but cheered by I think people all [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=161.64s)]
*  around the world. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  I think the situation in Syria is so dangerous, and he's taking bold decisive action to try [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=170.56s)]
*  to ensure the peace of that region. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=175.56s)]
*  It's a bold move, certainly, far bolder than what's been done before, but I think we've [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=178.56s)]
*  got to stand unequivocally in an unwavering manner, as the whip said, with Israel, our [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  closest ally and friend in the Middle East. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=189.52s)]
*  I think if we could bring control of that situation and bring about a lasting peace [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  there, it would do well for everybody, not just in the region, but around the world. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=196.12s)]
*  I think the strong and decisive move is an important step in that regard, as was noted [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=199.84s)]
*  earlier. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=204.04s)]
*  So he talks about it in very positive terms. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=205.04s)]
*  I thought MAGA was almost synonymous with America first, and so we hear that then from [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=209.2s)]
*  Johnson. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=214.32s)]
*  We saw a tweet from Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace posting, let's turn Gaza into Mar-a-Lago. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=215.32s)]
*  And of course, some of these same members were against aid for Ukraine, but they're [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  willing to go along with this? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=226.76s)]
*  Look, it becomes clear that some of these members, they really don't have any responsibility [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=230.24s)]
*  for themselves and the responsibility for which they took their oath of office. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=237.32s)]
*  So whatever Donald Trump says, no matter how foolish it may be, no matter how silly it [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=241.52s)]
*  may be, they will agree to it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=246.72s)]
*  That's clear. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=249.48s)]
*  They don't want to take care of their legislative responsibilities, because if you did, many [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=250.48s)]
*  of the things that Donald Trump currently is doing is against the law. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=257.52s)]
*  It's against bills that we passed in the United States Congress. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=261.96s)]
*  And now, without even coming back to Congress, without even talking to us at all, you're [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=265.96s)]
*  going to have an individual who says that no matter what we did, no matter what laws [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=270.91999999999996s)]
*  were passed, he is now the king, and so therefore he is going to determine what is. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=274.44s)]
*  And as opposed to us doing our legislative responsibility, because who needs someone [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  to be in a legislative body if you don't do your responsibility and you just do what [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=287.44s)]
*  the president says without regard to making it make whether it makes any sense or not? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  That's what happens in Russia, by the way. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=299.56s)]
*  If you look at the Russia Parliament in proceeding, it doesn't mean anything, because the only [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  thing that means anything is what Putin says. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=305.52000000000004s)]
*  That's what happens in China, by the way, because the dictator there is what he says, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=308.48s)]
*  not what the legislative body says. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=313.24s)]
*  There is no check and balance. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=315.24s)]
*  That's just a set up to have some people in there. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=317.64s)]
*  That's not who we are as the United States of America. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  That's not who the American people is. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  American people understand that we can't have an Elon Musk going into our records, getting [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  into our privacy with a 19-year-old. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=334.47999999999996s)]
*  It's national security interest to us and to everything that we stand for as members [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=337.96s)]
*  of the United States Congress and as people and citizens of the United States of America. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=343.36s)]
*  Congressman, let me ask you more about Elon Musk here. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=348.84s)]
*  I know you were among House ranking members who wrote a letter to the president asking [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=351.32s)]
*  for information on potential doge access to classified information in the Treasury Department. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=355.28s)]
*  Can you walk us through what you're hoping to find out? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=361.56s)]
*  Yeah, look, what are they looking for and why and who are they? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  Do they have any clearance? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=368.32s)]
*  We're talking about very important and sensitive personal data and information. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=370.92s)]
*  You have someone who's unelected, the rich billionaire, so he's an oligarch, coming [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  in with a 19-year-old and others that are younger, accessing private information. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=382.76s)]
*  We've been talking about China coming in and dealing with private information, and now [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=389.44s)]
*  internally we're going to have this. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=394.28s)]
*  What for? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=396.2s)]
*  What are they going to utilize it for? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=397.2s)]
*  What medical records are at stake? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=399.16s)]
*  Social Security payments, disability payments, these are all private information of American [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=400.8s)]
*  citizens that this man is moving into with 19-year-olds who have no clearance, no information, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=407.36s)]
*  no wine or anything of that nature. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=415.56s)]
*  That is insane. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=418.2s)]
*  And we as a member of the United States Congress, all of us, whether you're a Democrat or Republican, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=420.6s)]
*  should be standing up and speaking in one voice and say we are not going to allow that to happen. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=426.04s)]
