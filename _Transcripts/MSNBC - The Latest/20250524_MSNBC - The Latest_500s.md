# 'Rampant, rapacious corruption': Trump charges $1 million a pop for club memberships
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k)
*  A federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump's effort to ban foreign students from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=0.0s)]
*  Harvard, a stunning escalation in his attacks on the institution. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=4.96s)]
*  It's just the latest example of Trump pushing the limits of the presidency like we have [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=9.16s)]
*  never seen before. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=13.08s)]
*  And if it were any other administration, what he's been doing would be considered a huge [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=15.16s)]
*  scandal by now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  But wait, there's more. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=21.52s)]
*  Thursday night, Trump held a private dinner at his golf club in Northern Virginia for [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  220 crypto investors who bought into his meme coin. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=28.24s)]
*  In total, guests spent more than $394 million on the cryptocurrency. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=32.96s)]
*  That's nearly $2 million each on average, according to the blockchain analytics firm [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=40.36s)]
*  Nansen. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=45.4s)]
*  The event has raised alarm bells, obviously, about whether this allows the ultra wealthy [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=46.84s)]
*  to buy access to the most powerful person in the world. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=51.76s)]
*  The White House has claimed that there is no conflict of interest, but ethics experts [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=55.64s)]
*  and Democrats are buying it, warning that this is corruption full stop. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=60.88s)]
*  Donald Trump is using the presidency of the United States to make himself richer through [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=67.12s)]
*  crypto, and he's doing it right out there in plain sight. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=74.6s)]
*  President Trump is saying, open your wallet, hand me your money, and we'll consider the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=79.0s)]
*  request that you have. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=84.16s)]
*  This is the most corrupt White House in the history of the country. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=86.36s)]
*  Just because the corruption is playing out in public where everybody can see it doesn't [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=91.66s)]
*  mean that it isn't rampant, rapacious corruption. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=95.08s)]
*  And it's not just the concerns of the Democratic Party that Trump seems to be ignoring. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  This week, the Pentagon announced that it has officially accepted that luxury jet from [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=105.6s)]
*  as the new Air Force One, the one that Jonathan continues to remind us is used. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=111.2s)]
*  A gift that came under scrutiny from both Democrats and some Republicans. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  We should note that a source familiar with the matter told NBC that the deal is not yet [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=122.44s)]
*  finalized nor have the legal issues been resolved. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=126.92s)]
*  Joining us now is April Ryan, Washington bureau chief and White House correspondent for Black [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=131.0s)]
*  Press USA and host of the Tea with April on Substack, and Dan Cole, former deputy assistant [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=135.46s)]
*  to President Biden and host of the People's Cabinet podcast. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=141.42s)]
*  Thank you both for joining us. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=146.1s)]
*  A lot to get to. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=147.1s)]
*  You know, April, I want to start with you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=148.1s)]
*  I remember, you remember, we all remember when Jimmy Carter had to sell his peanut farm [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  because of the possible conflict of interest. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=156.66s)]
*  This is an entirely different world and Donald Trump doesn't even care about the appearance [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=159.22s)]
*  of a conflict of interest, it seems. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=162.92s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=164.62s)]
*  It's in your face, Eugene. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=165.62s)]
*  It is in your face. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=166.62s)]
*  But not only you talk about Jimmy Carter selling a peanut farm, I think about other presidents [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  who had to put their assets or their stocks, things like that nature in a blind trust. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=171.9s)]
*  This president is saying, hey, I can charge you for access. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=177.54s)]
*  Come here for something that has no value. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=181.94s)]
*  But what does this say to the American public that I can see the president at any moment? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  But is it right? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=189.34s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=190.58s)]
*  Does it really bolster the American dollar? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=191.86s)]
*  Does it bolster the office? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=195.38000000000002s)]
*  But does it bolster his pocket? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=197.02s)]
*  And what it looks like is it's bolstering his pocket. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=199.22000000000003s)]
*  And the problem is, in this moment, Democrats are not in charge. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=201.74s)]
*  They can scream all they want, and even Republicans, but they're not going to put him in the hot [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=205.82000000000002s)]
*  seat in this moment. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=211.26000000000002s)]
*  So he knows that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=212.62s)]
*  And that's why it's so in your face. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=213.62s)]
*  He's going against what is traditional, what other presidents have done by saying, hey, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=215.26000000000002s)]
*  I want to be forthright. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=219.46s)]
*  I'm going to put this stuff away. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=220.98s)]
*  I mean, remember the first term. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=222.3s)]
*  He didn't even want to acknowledge his taxes. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=223.62s)]
*  So, I mean, we still ain't seen it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=225.7s)]
*  It was a scandal and deservedly so when Hunter Biden's paintings were selling for six figures. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=229.66s)]
*  That was ridiculous. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=235.9s)]
*  It was absurd. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=236.9s)]
*  Just like this is absolutely absurd. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=237.9s)]
*  But that was quiet. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=239.9s)]
*  Oh, it was quiet. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=240.9s)]
*  Versus like, totally doing it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=242.22s)]
*  Yeah, it was quiet unless you were in a lead out of the art gallery. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=244.06s)]
*  But have we even seen a good list of all of these people who are the two million of pop [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=247.62s)]
*  crypto investors? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=252.82000000000002s)]
*  Because no, because it's a private gathering. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=253.82000000000002s)]
*  Lamar Odom, former NBA basketball player, was there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=256.94s)]
*  Apparently he tweeted about it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=260.02000000000004s)]
*  But other than that, not really. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=261.02000000000004s)]
*  No, he was caught on tape walking in with his umbrella. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=262.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=265.42s)]
*  Quite the contrary. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=266.42s)]
*  We're seeing people come in wearing masks so people don't identify them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=268.06s)]
*  But one of the person who we recognize the most was Justin Sun, who was most well known [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=271.7s)]
*  for buying a banana for six million dollars and eating it in front of people. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=277.18s)]
*  And so at the same time in which he is barring foreign students from coming to this country, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=281.82s)]
*  he's telling other foreign people, if you pay enough of my coin, I'll regale you at [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=285.82s)]
*  one of my country clubs. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  What message has that said to the country? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=290.94s)]
*  You know, April, we were talking about the in-your-face nature of the president's corruption. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=293.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm old enough to remember when, you know, remember, April, you were [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=299.26s)]
*  there. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=305.26s)]
*  Wait a minute, you're old enough and you're trying to bring me in. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=306.42s)]
*  Let's not get into a... [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=309.42s)]
*  I am saying we're not together. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=310.42s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=311.42s)]
*  I am so sorry, April. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=315.78s)]
*  But the point I'm trying to get to is, you were covering the Clinton White House. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=316.78s)]
*  Remember the whole Lincoln bedroom controversy and how hair on fire the Republicans were? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=320.02s)]
*  Listen to Senator Blumenthal, what he had to say about Republicans this go-around. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=326.82s)]
*  He said this on Thursday. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=332.14s)]
*  This story is about Donald Trump, but it's also about Republicans. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=335.86s)]
*  It's about Republicans having no backbone or spine. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=339.46s)]
*  It's about Republicans complicit in Donald Trump's corruption. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=343.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, April, where they at? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=348.38s)]
*  Where are the Republicans? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=352.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, let me say this. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=354.26s)]
*  It seems like do as I say, not as I do. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=356.42s)]
*  Okay? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=359.02s)]
*  It's such hypocrisy here. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=360.02s)]
*  I do remember. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=361.02s)]
*  I was reporting when Bill Clinton was president during the second term. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=362.02s)]
*  Yes, we have aged around us. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=367.09999999999997s)]
*  You've aged beautifully though. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=369.62s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=372.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=373.02s)]
*  But at this point, I mean, that seems so minimal. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=374.02s)]
*  Remember when Barack Obama and Michelle Obama took that first date on the plane to go to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=379.97999999999996s)]
*  Broadway? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=385.29999999999995s)]
*  Oh, great. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=386.29999999999995s)]
*  They lost their minds. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=387.29999999999995s)]
*  People lost their minds. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=388.82s)]
*  And this isn't even the brown suit issue. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=389.82s)]
*  They lost their minds over these issues. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=391.82s)]
*  And now we have things in your face and people are like, okay, sitting back. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=394.5s)]
*  Republicans are sitting back. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=398.58s)]
*  Democrats are screaming foul. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=400.02s)]
*  But here's what I'm going to say about the Democrats in this moment. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=401.74s)]
*  If indeed the House does turn, if indeed the Senate does turn at the midterms, you [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=405.02s)]
*  can bet your bottom dollar on this. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NjoiBoY_k&t=411.94s)]
