# ‘Fearmongering’: Dem lawmaker slams 'chaotic, corrupt' Trump admin's travel ban
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio)
*  And joining us now, Democratic Congresswoman Madeline Dean of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=0.0s)]
*  She is on the Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=4.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, thanks for taking the time. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=6.0s)]
*  What's your immediate reaction to this ban? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=8.0s)]
*  Are you surprised he's done it again? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=10.0s)]
*  I'm not. I do appreciate the detailed legal analysis that your guest just went through. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=12.0s)]
*  It is a fast analysis of the differences between this and 2017. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=18.0s)]
*  But standing here not as a legal analyst, but as a member of Congress, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=23.0s)]
*  what I notice is this is more of the same from Donald Trump. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=28.0s)]
*  A false connection to the horrific anti-Semitic attack in Boulder by what appears to be an Egyptian national, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=31.0s)]
*  and then connecting it to these 12 countries and a ban on immigration. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=39.0s)]
*  And it is also a distraction. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=44.0s)]
*  Mr. Trump is looking for distractions from, for example, his big bad bill that seems to be going down in popularity here, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=46.0s)]
*  thanks to his former co-president, Elon Musk. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=54.0s)]
*  It's a distraction. And the other thing I really don't like about it, and it is more of the same from Mr. Trump, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=57.0s)]
*  he says, we just don't want them. We don't want them here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=63.0s)]
*  It is so bigoted. It is fear-mongering. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=67.0s)]
*  It is to say these people are different from us. Their skin color may be different from us. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=70.0s)]
*  Their language is different from us. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=74.0s)]
*  You know what? I rely upon my faith, which I think Mr. Trump shares with me. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=76.0s)]
*  As a Christian, we welcome the stranger. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=80.0s)]
*  That is a part of the tenets of my faith. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=83.0s)]
*  I was a stranger, and you welcomed me. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=86.0s)]
*  This is fear-mongering. This is much of the same. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=88.0s)]
*  It is a distraction from the horror that is this chaotic, corrupt administration. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=91.0s)]
*  It could be just a diversion tactic, the timing of this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=97.0s)]
*  And yet we all remember the outcry we saw from Americans after that first Trump travel ban. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=101.0s)]
*  It matters to a lot of people in this country for many of the reasons you just outlined. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=108.0s)]
*  Let's listen to some reaction, at least the initial reaction, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=113.0s)]
*  from some people at LAX yesterday after this ban was announced. Watch. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=117.0s)]
*  I think a lot of people are in need of asylum, of course, that are coming from those countries. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=122.0s)]
*  Not all of them are bad people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=129.0s)]
*  But the reality is that to be 100 percent safe, sometimes the best thing, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=132.0s)]
*  at least in the short term, might be to mandate a certain travel ban. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=137.0s)]
*  I like Trump and what he's doing, but I don't know the reasons for what he's doing this for. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=143.0s)]
*  I think as long as they're properly credentialed, they should be able to arrive. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=149.0s)]
*  What strikes me about some of that is it feels like such a far cry from the outrage [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=155.0s)]
*  and those protests that were triggered immediately after the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=160.0s)]
*  quote unquote Muslim travel ban the first time around. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=165.0s)]
*  Do you think Americans see things differently now? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=168.0s)]
*  I worry about that, to be very honest. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=172.0s)]
*  That one was so nakedly an attempt to ban people of a particular faith, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=174.0s)]
*  and that was exposed back in 2017. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=179.0s)]
*  I do worry that Mr. Trump's behavior is so outrageous, but it's becoming normalized. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=182.0s)]
*  We must never believe that this is a normal set of behaviors. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=189.0s)]
*  After all, and what that person said, I'd like to know the rational basis for this choice of 12 countries. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=192.0s)]
*  Again, Egypt isn't in it, and he connected it to the Egyptian nationals' attack on 15 people, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=198.0s)]
*  injuring 15 people, including a Holocaust survivor. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=207.0s)]
*  There's no connection. There's no rational basis. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=210.0s)]
*  And the data shows that if you take all of these 12 countries and take a look at terrorist activity [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=212.0s)]
*  as a result of it, over the course of many years, there has been one terrorist attack in this country [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=218.0s)]
*  from anybody from any of these 12 countries. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=223.0s)]
*  There's no rational basis. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=226.0s)]
*  Again, it's a distraction, because look what we're not talking about. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=227.0s)]
*  We are not talking about starvation in Gaza, and the United States is taking a pass on that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=231.0s)]
*  I am outraged by that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=237.0s)]
*  I will be doing everything I can to say that Mr. Netanyahu, blocking aid into Gaza, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=239.0s)]
*  all of these weeks and weeks and weeks, and now with what appears to be Israel taking aim [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=244.0s)]
*  and killing people three days in a row who are desperately trying to get food, nutrition, humanitarian aid. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=253.0s)]
*  We're not talking about that. Gaza is starving. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=260.0s)]
*  We're not talking about the fact that the hostages are still not home, living and deceased. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=263.0s)]
*  This administration is dropping the ball on so many things, sowing chaos everywhere else, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=268.0s)]
*  not to mention in the economy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=273.0s)]
*  My constituents are gravely upset, and I hope that we don't get so accustomed to this chaos [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=276.0s)]
*  and corruption and bigotry of the style of administration that we have that we will say, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=283.0s)]
*  oh, okay, maybe it makes sense to ban people from 12 nations. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=289.0s)]
*  In addition to this new travel ban, there was this new executive order against Harvard [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=294.0s)]
*  and foreign students studying at Harvard, and there was also this, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=299.0s)]
*  Trump directing his attorney general to investigate President Biden's use of AutoPen to sign various actions. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=304.0s)]
*  I should note, AutoPen is a standard presidential tool. It's legal. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=311.0s)]
*  Trump himself uses it. What's your reaction to this? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=315.0s)]
*  I'm laughing because it's absolutely laughable. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=319.0s)]
*  He's got to get over it. The man won. Mr. Biden is not president. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=322.0s)]
*  He uses AutoPen. He also uses his own EKG Sharpie. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=327.0s)]
*  Maybe we need to investigate that. It's absolutely laughable. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=331.0s)]
*  There are investigations that need to take place, and that is not one of them. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=335.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Madeline Dean, thank you very much for taking the time with us. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=340.0s)]
*  We appreciate you joining us. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=344.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1FvtSa4tio&t=352.0s)]
