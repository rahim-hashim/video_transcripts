# ‘My community is being terrorized’ by ICE raids: Nebraska official reacts to big Omaha ICE operation
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw)
*  Welcome back. Ice raids sparking fear in communities all across the country, including in Omaha, Nebraska, where 80 people were detained in raids targeting two businesses yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=0.0s)]
*  The cell phone video capturing inside the lunchroom at a food processing plant showing ice agents with handcuffed employees. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=10.0s)]
*  And you might see in the video there in the background, the motto together we achieve more written across the wall. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=18.0s)]
*  Outside that plant, a small group attempted to block ice vehicles. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=24.0s)]
*  One protester you see there clinging to the front bumper and then another throwing his body against the doors as officers sped up and then hit the brakes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=29.0s)]
*  The county commissioner learning of those raids during a live streamed meeting and then excusing himself. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=38.0s)]
*  Apologies to the board and the public as well. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=46.0s)]
*  I have to depart at this point. My community is being terrorized by immigration rates at this moment as we speak. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=49.0s)]
*  There's word of at least two raids happening at this moment, so I have to go try and help. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=56.0s)]
*  Joining us now, the man you just heard, Douglas County, Nebraska Commissioner Roger Garcia. Commissioner, thank you for taking the time with us. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=63.0s)]
*  Let's start with that moment. You said your community was being terrorized. Tell us more. How'd you learn the news? What was going through your mind in that moment? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=71.0s)]
*  Yes, good morning. Thank you for having me. There were some rumors already brewing that morning that something might happen. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=79.0s)]
*  So we were already on edge trying to monitor the situation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=86.0s)]
*  So in the middle of my meeting that morning yesterday, I started getting videos and pictures of this ice activity, and I just knew I had to go help the community in whatever way that I could. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=90.0s)]
*  So I just had to depart my live meeting and touch base with community members to try to figure out what was going on and how we can best help those impacted families. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=102.0s)]
*  What was the feeling? Was it a gut punch? Was it anger or outrage? What are you feeling? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=112.0s)]
*  It's just incredibly sad that people woke up to just go to work to provide for their families, to contribute to our local economy here in Omaha. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=119.0s)]
*  And they end up in the midst of chaos as a surprise ice raid comes to their company, as family members are detained and we're left hanging, not even knowing where these individuals will be detained, where they're going. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=128.0s)]
*  There's a lot of confusion, and it was a very difficult and messy day. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=142.0s)]
*  The mayor's office says 80 people were arrested. What do you know about them? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=146.0s)]
*  Yeah, we've been told it's about 80 or so. The majority appear to be from one meatpacking plant here in Omaha called Glen Valley. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=151.0s)]
*  We're trying to figure out who they are, where they're going, what charges are being laid against them, and how we can best get them connected with legal representation as soon as possible. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=162.0s)]
*  The Glen Valley Foods production plant is in South Omaha, and we've learned nearly a quarter of residents are foreign born in this area. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=173.0s)]
*  Our affiliate reports fears of ice activity has left businesses empty. So what is the feeling in the community right now, especially after these raids? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=182.0s)]
*  We have a very thriving and vibrant local business community that's led by a lot of Latino business merchants. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=191.0s)]
*  Yesterday they closed down early, locked their doors, and went home or hunkered down in their own business. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=200.0s)]
*  Today, many of those businesses are staying closed because of the fear that has been instilled in our community. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=207.0s)]
*  So it's a very sad day. It's another day of continued tension and fear, not knowing if there's going to be more immigration activity today and beyond, both in Omaha and in Nebraska in general. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=213.0s)]
*  So many questions are still not answered. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=228.0s)]
*  I mean, my understanding is Omaha is sort of a blue enclave in a red state. Do you think that's why your community has been targeted with these raids? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=231.0s)]
*  Well, we definitely are unsure why our community was targeted, but it was the first day of our new Democratic African American mayor, the first African American mayor in our history of Omaha. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=243.0s)]
*  And so we were proud to welcome him as the new mayor. This was his first day. I'm the first Latino County Commissioner. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=256.0s)]
*  I've been here a few years at this point, but none of us expected any of this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=263.0s)]
*  And the sad thing is that I, for one, and many of my colleagues had no idea this was going to happen. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=268.0s)]
*  So we had to deal with it in real time and really try to decipher through all the noise and try to figure out what was truly happening at the moment. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=274.0s)]
*  We showed those videos at the top and we could see people blocking ICE vehicles, jumping on top of bumpers, some reportedly through rocks. What do you say to those people? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=284.0s)]
*  I understand their concern for those being detained and that they want to stand up for them, which is really amazing that their heart is there. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=295.0s)]
*  I definitely also don't want anybody to get physically injured. I also don't want anybody to have federal charges against them for impeding an ICE officer. So it's a difficult balance. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=305.0s)]
*  I would stress peaceful protests, which we had two peaceful protests in Omaha yesterday. They were very well attended. There's also ways to refer families to legal representation and resources. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=317.0s)]
*  So right now we're trying to generate energy towards solutions and resources for families that have been impacted alongside solidarity through peaceful protests. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=330.0s)]
*  Commissioner Roger Garcia, thank you for joining us. We really appreciate you taking the time. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=340.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=345.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZVgQyI4Kpw&t=360.0s)]
