# Musk demoted as public sours on ‘broken’ Trump govt at 100 days: See alarming video, Melber Report
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg)
*  Trump is drawing low grades from Wall Street today, the conservative Wall Street Journal, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=0.0s)]
*  reporting on the fact that his tariffs have dragged down the markets worst for the Dow [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=4.96s)]
*  and the top 500 companies, S&P 500, since Nixon. Low grades from the public. We've seen that in a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  battery of new polls that shows Trump sagging, including losing support from his own side, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=17.68s)]
*  conservatives and republicans. We're also seeing a type of low grade from Congress. 100 days in, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  you can make this comparison. His own party can't seem to get him to cooperate on passing bills. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=27.6s)]
*  Low grade, low number of bills there, just five in these 100 days. That is one of the least [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=33.04s)]
*  productive legislative starts to any term, as you can see, going all the way back to the 50s. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=38.0s)]
*  Low grades from the courts. Trump has faced more rebukes from judges and even the Supreme Court [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=43.6s)]
*  more quickly than any president in the modern era. Tonight, Trump holding a rally for the 100-day [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  mark. That is the first sort of public political rally of this term. We're keeping an eye on that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=55.04s)]
*  You can see it just getting underway in Michigan, a state where he has seen the tariffs really rock [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=59.36s)]
*  the economy and labor out there. And look, I always try to keep it real with you. This is a time where [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=66.24s)]
*  President Trump and his team have obviously courted controversy, at times confusion. That's how the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=71.68s)]
*  markets feel, and even a type of chaos. Some of it by design. They've pushed sweeping changes and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=76.48s)]
*  faced unusually strong pushback, even if they don't want to admit it or want you to realize [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=82.64s)]
*  how many other people are in this sort of resistance right now. And that pushback has been a response [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=87.92s)]
*  to Trump extremism and sometimes illegality by him and his aides. So with that in mind, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=94.48s)]
*  to separate the drama from the substance, what we've done here, just to tell you before I show [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=102.32s)]
*  you this, is combed through the 100 days, both the president's actions and their results, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=105.44s)]
*  the administration's claims, and the wider pushback I mentioned in the fact checking to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=111.12s)]
*  put it in context. We've done that as a team here, our beat producers and journalists, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=115.28s)]
*  to create this new video report. So get comfortable. I'll tell you, seeing it all together can be [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=119.92s)]
*  instructive. I'm going to show you this and discuss it with James Carville on the other side. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=125.04s)]
*  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=131.84s)]
*  Donald Trump was sworn in for a second term as president. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=134.72s)]
*  He pardoned or commuted the sentences of everybody. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=137.6s)]
*  1500 convicted and accused insurrectionists. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=141.68s)]
*  A federal judge has just temporarily blocked President Trump's order, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=144.88s)]
*  attempting to end birthright citizenship. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=148.0s)]
*  The president himself cannot amend the constitution. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=150.0s)]
*  Radical plan to freeze government spending is on hold. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  Elon Musk did not create USAID. He doesn't have the power to destroy it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=156.56s)]
*  A federal judge said that Elon Musk's folks who are inside of the treasury department's payment [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=168.32s)]
*  systems have to stop a wave of mass firings. I have no idea how I'm going to recover from this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  Outrage at the dismantling of the federal government. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=179.76s)]
*  Do your job. How can you be represented by you if you don't have a voice in Congress? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=186.56s)]
*  If we don't do this, America will go bankrupt. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=192.48s)]
*  Nothing that is being done, nothing, is actually making life better for the American people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=195.44s)]
*  You don't have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=207.92s)]
*  Nothing but swift and unrelenting action. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=212.32s)]
*  President Trump is losing in a major way at the Supreme Court. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=215.84s)]
*  The president invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=220.88s)]
*  Those planned deportations that had supposed to have been halted went forward. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=228.56s)]
*  Editor in chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, says he was accidentally texted war plans. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  Have you ever had somebody's contact that shows their name and then you have somebody else's number? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  This president is wrong. And he's violating principles that we hold dear. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=245.2s)]
*  The Trump administration has already admitted that they deported him recklessly. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=251.92s)]
*  They charge us, we charge them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=256.24s)]
*  This, I think fair to say, is worse than the worst case scenario of the tariffs. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=258.0s)]
*  Burning down the house to cook a steak. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  The Dow, the S&P and the NASDAQ all down between three and a half and now five percent. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  Economic Armageddon. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=272.96s)]
*  Trump's trade war wiping trillions of dollars in value from these markets. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=274.96s)]
*  I know very few people, very few people, I can probably count them on a hand, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  who think that this is a good idea. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=283.44s)]
*  The president paused his additional tariffs on dozens of our trading partners for the next 90 days. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=286.08s)]
*  We have breaking news right now from the Supreme Court. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=291.44s)]
*  The Supreme Court unanimously ordered Garcia to come back. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=293.84s)]
*  It's all about the erosion of the rule of law. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=297.44s)]
*  Now, 90 days may not seem like a long time, but remember Trump has only been president for 82 days. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=300.4s)]
*  And it already feels like a goddamn decade. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=307.2s)]
*  Always we're complacent with China saying, oh, let's not make them mad. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  I want to make them mad. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=314.88s)]
*  The constitutional crisis is here. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=316.32s)]
*  President Bukele does not want to give him back to the United States, nor do we want him back. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=318.64s)]
*  We will not allow the United States of America to become an oligarchy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=323.68s)]
*  This head-to-head really between President Trump and Fed Chair Jay Powell. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=330.88s)]
*  The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Trump administration [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=335.68s)]
*  from deporting a second group of migrants. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=338.96s)]
*  The markets now continue to drop. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=341.28s)]
*  Duterte crushed our institutions within six months of taking office. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=342.96s)]
*  Can't have a trial for all of these people. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=348.24s)]
*  The United States, this administration is moving faster. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=351.84s)]
*  In the long run, will it hurt the country 51 percent? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=354.8s)]
*  Paramount is trying to complete a merger. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=358.64s)]
*  The Trump administration must approve it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=361.84s)]
*  Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=364.8s)]
*  Protests are not to solve a problem. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=369.36s)]
*  We're not going back. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=371.28s)]
*  Protests are to expose a problem. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=372.96s)]
*  The public is deeply, deeply, deeply against what Trump is doing. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=375.2s)]
*  100 days, we're joined by Democratic Senator James Carville. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=380.64s)]
*  Does it feel like 100 days, and what do we learn out of that? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  It feels like 100 years. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=386.56s)]
*  What we learned is kind of what we already know, but we really learned it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  And it was a great job that your team did putting that together, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  just to remind us of the disaster that this 100 days has been for the United States. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=393.67999999999995s)]
*  And I think when you watch that, it actually will give you a resolve to, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=398.96s)]
*  you know, make the next 100 days really painful for him. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, they're facing over 200 lawsuits in these first 100 days. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=406.32s)]
*  Judges have rejected many more Trump policy efforts than they have allowed. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  The exes here tell that story. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=416.56s)]
*  That sometimes gets lost in all the headlines. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=417.84s)]
*  The Supreme Court has blocked the effort to seize war powers. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=420.0s)]
*  And interestingly, James, what you see there is not the coalition [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  that Trump and his lawyers expected. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=428.4s)]
*  They thought they could either win or have a split. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=430.96s)]
*  Instead, all three Trump justices, along with the rest of the court there, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=434.08s)]
*  went 7-2 on the war powers issue, at least in the first skirmish. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=437.84s)]
*  How does that set them on their heels? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=442.4s)]
*  Well, we have lawyers at court that go into the courts. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=445.44s)]
*  We should do all of that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=448.32s)]
*  The political operation of the Democratic Party and the opposition, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=449.84s)]
*  we don't have a lot to say about this. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=453.68s)]
*  Okay, I hope they do well. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=456.4s)]
*  Great. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=458.24s)]
*  But what we can do is focus on the things that we can illustrate. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=458.96s)]
*  How much? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=462.8s)]
*  Four and a half trillion dollars. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=463.68s)]
*  They want middle-class people to pay four and a half trillion dollars [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=465.76s)]
*  so they can give Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos another tax cut. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=469.28s)]
*  Just stay on that. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=473.68s)]
*  The courts are going to work their way through. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=475.2s)]
*  Well, let me ask you, do you think that— [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=476.88s)]
*  because we live in this divided time we're here— [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=478.47999999999996s)]
*  but do you think that the courts having a kind of bipartisan rejection [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=480.0s)]
*  of Trump immigration, does that give the country a sense of, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=484.08s)]
*  oh, this isn't just some namby-pamby East Coast complaint? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=486.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=490.96s)]
*  I think when it came down 9-0 on that case, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=492.88s)]
*  there were 15 judges that said, you've got to return this guy. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=496.64s)]
*  I hear in Manhattan, if I get a parking ticket, I have to pay it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=501.84s)]
*  If I make an illegal left turn, I don't have the option of ignoring that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  They'll come get you. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=508.96s)]
*  A citizen doesn't have a chance to disobey a court order, nor should you. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=510.8s)]
*  Yet he's a president of 15 different judges of different kinds. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=514.64s)]
*  You can't do this. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  That's simple enough for people to understand. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=519.68s)]
*  Yeah, and on the politics, back in the Clinton era, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=521.36s)]
*  you were dealing with this vast right-wing conspiracy. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=523.68s)]
*  Some people said at the time, was that overstated? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=527.2s)]
*  I think the history bore it out. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=531.2s)]
*  And it was really united. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=533.52s)]
*  I showed the Wall Street Journal being critical of Trump now. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=535.2s)]
*  And interestingly, here's Republican Speaker Johnson on the rough start. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=537.92s)]
*  Now, look, there's always a... [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=544.0s)]
*  In any new administration, it's a roller coaster, right? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=546.64s)]
*  When you come in, you make dramatic change, which is what he did. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=549.68s)]
*  People, they have an emotional reaction sometimes for the big changes. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=552.4s)]
*  Question and concern about the rocky start, some of the stock markets, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=555.92s)]
*  some of the terror policy and all that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=559.76s)]
*  So look, polling goes up and down. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=561.6s)]
*  So maybe the guy can't help but tell the truth every night. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=566.16s)]
*  But you know, in Wall Street Journal, there was nobody [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=569.76s)]
*  that was more right-wing than the Wall Street Journal editorial page, ever. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=572.48s)]
*  All right? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=575.9200000000001s)]
*  I know a lot of these guys in the poll, I know a lot of them. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=576.48s)]
*  And the fact that you have people like that, that are coming out of the woodwork, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=580.4s)]
*  I think is important, just like the people at the Bullwalk and other people. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=584.72s)]
*  And I think they're going to make it safe where some of these Republicans [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=589.68s)]
*  up for reelection will say, man, I just can't go here. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=592.4799999999999s)]
*  We have to make it as hard on them as we can possibly make it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=595.04s)]
*  And what I notice is, and we follow this, the conservative streamers and potosphere, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=599.8399999999999s)]
*  right now at least, is a little less partisan than the conservative East Coast folks [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=606.8s)]
*  who are tied to the GOP. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=612.4799999999999s)]
*  And so it almost seems like a leading indicator, tell me your view, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=613.76s)]
*  where in a week or two, it doesn't take them that long. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=616.7199999999999s)]
*  They go, wait a minute, this is too far on immigration. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=619.12s)]
*  So this is something that I know. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=622.4s)]
*  People like immigrants, OK? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=625.12s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=627.36s)]
*  They don't like his disorder. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=628.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, for the first part of his administration, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=630.32s)]
*  President Biden listened to a bunch of lefties, and we had a disorder, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=633.76s)]
*  and people didn't like it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=636.96s)]
*  We paid a price for it. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=638.24s)]
*  But now they're actually going after immigrant people. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=640.16s)]
*  Legal residents. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=643.52s)]
*  Legal residents in the United States, and most Americans say, look, hey, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  you're here, you're legal, I don't care. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=648.24s)]
*  It doesn't matter to me where you came from. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's an argument we're going to win. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=651.36s)]
*  And you see these guys on the right now, a lot of them are sympathetic to agricultural [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=653.92s)]
*  interests, which really need immigration really bad. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=659.12s)]
*  A lot of them have some, you know, some of these guys have kind of religious convictions. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=662.08s)]
*  Might not be the same that you and I would have, but how you treat migrants is part of [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=666.24s)]
*  that convention. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=671.6s)]
*  And he was on the right track to say we shouldn't have disorder, but he's way on the wrong [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=672.72s)]
*  track saying that these are not good people, because by and large, most of them are really [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=678.08s)]
*  good people. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=683.12s)]
*  They commit less crimes. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=683.5200000000001s)]
*  They work harder than other people. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=684.96s)]
*  Most of them are just terrific people, and I'm glad that they're here. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=688.48s)]
*  So what grade do you give these 100 days? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=691.84s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, I taught at the College of... [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=697.2800000000001s)]
*  Community College, private universities, state universities. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=700.24s)]
*  I never gave an F my whole time. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=703.44s)]
*  I'd say if you make an A, you got to earn it. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=705.68s)]
*  But if you make an F, you really got to earn it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=708.0799999999999s)]
*  I got to say he's earned an F. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=710.7199999999999s)]
*  He's earned an F. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=712.8s)]
*  Dude, you get something that no student of mine ever did in 16 years. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=713.12s)]
*  You earned an F big time. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRr7z_y2SQg&t=716.64s)]
