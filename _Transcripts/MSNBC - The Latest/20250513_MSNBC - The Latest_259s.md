# Suitcase full of jewels: How past administrations dealt with inappropriate gifts
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc)
*  We've obviously never seen anything remotely close to a foreign country gifting an American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=0.0s)]
*  president a free, it's not really free to the taxpayer by the way, $400 million luxury [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  plane. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  But big oil rich nations have been showering U.S. politicians with lavish gifts for decades. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  This goes way back. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=15.68s)]
*  I mean in 1985, Saudi Arabia gave Ronald Reagan a gold and enamel egg with a tiny bejeweled [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=16.68s)]
*  clock inside. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=22.72s)]
*  You can see it right there on your screen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=23.72s)]
*  The country of Azerbaijan gifted the Clintons in 1997 a fancy rug and blazoned with their [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=25.72s)]
*  portraits on it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=30.52s)]
*  There you go. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=32.0s)]
*  That's special. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=33.0s)]
*  In 2008, Libya's leader, Muammar Gaddafi, gave Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice a [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=34.0s)]
*  massive diamond ring, massive, and they lock it with an outline of the African continent [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=39.2s)]
*  and a picture of Gaddafi as a much, much younger man. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=44.72s)]
*  You can see it there on your screen. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=48.92s)]
*  It was well known he also had a bit of a crush on her and it definitely shows with that gift. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=50.4s)]
*  But government officials and even presidents don't get to keep those gifts unless they [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=55.6s)]
*  pay for them out of pocket. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=59.36s)]
*  So unless Secretary Rice forked over a bunch of cash, she is not currently the owner of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=61.28s)]
*  that massive diamond ring. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=65.64s)]
*  It's the government's property and the U.S. government can choose to donate, sell, or [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=67.48s)]
*  otherwise dispose of gifts like that if they see fit or they can be loaned out to presidential [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=71.8s)]
*  libraries. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=77.0s)]
*  Now, I remember this all made me think about one particular trip back in 2009 when President [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=78.0s)]
*  Obama went to Saudi Arabia and the king gave gifts, big ones, not just to the Obamas, but [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=83.48s)]
*  to several of his advisors, including Ben Rhodes, who wrote about it in his book, The [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  World As It Is, and he wrote about what was waiting for him in his room on that trip when [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  he returned from a day of meetings. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=98.7s)]
*  Here's what he wrote. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=100.12s)]
*  When I opened the door to my unit, I found a large suitcase. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=101.12s)]
*  Inside were jewels. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=105.26s)]
*  Now, pivotally, he explains, no one kept them. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=106.26s)]
*  It feels like this White House, I think it's safe to say, is approaching things a little [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=110.12s)]
*  bit differently, but it felt worth discussing how this is supposed to work. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=113.28s)]
*  So joining me now is Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security advisor for President Obama [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=116.28s)]
*  and someone I trust as much as anybody to explain foreign policy stuff like this and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=121.0s)]
*  many other things. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  Okay, Ben, I was not on this trip. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  I do remember it well because I think it was sort of shocking to those of you who received [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=129.32s)]
*  these suitcases, these surprise suitcases of jewels and other things. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  And I remember you all wanting to kind of get as far away from it as possible. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  So I just want to start there because I think it helps explain how abnormal what we're seeing [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=144.88s)]
*  now is. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=149.76s)]
*  Yeah, Jen, I remember it well. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=150.76s)]
*  It was one of the first trips we took overseas in 2009. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  I had not slept on the plane. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=158.76s)]
*  I was working on a speech that President Obama gave in Cairo, which was a high-profile speech. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  And I come into this room, I'm saying, and it was kind of like almost like a bungalow. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  And there's just a suitcase there right inside the door. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=169.44s)]
*  And I open it, and it was full of these jewels kind of mounted on this suitcase. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=172.2s)]
*  And for a minute, I kind of panicked because I thought, well, maybe they know I'm the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=178.76s)]
*  speechwriter writing this high-profile speech he's giving to the world, and this is some [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=183.12s)]
*  kind of extra special gift for me. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=186.44s)]
*  But then I quickly found out that everybody had gotten these suitcases. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=189.78s)]
*  And we were very quickly told by the State Protocol Office that helps plan these visits [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=194.16s)]
*  to just give them the suitcases. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=198.76s)]
*  I think this thing was in my possession for not even a night. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  And we were offered the opportunity to pay tens of thousands of dollars of our own money [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=204.96s)]
*  if we wanted to keep these things. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=210.0s)]
*  We obviously didn't do that and didn't even think about it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=211.16s)]
*  It wouldn't even cross my mind to kind of take some of these jewels and slide it in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=214.24s)]
*  my bag. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  Little did I know that if it had been a $400 million plane, maybe I could have kept it [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  or maybe a $2 billion investment in my fund, as Jared Kushner got. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  But time seemed to have changed. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=230.0s)]
*  It's quaint almost remembering these times. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=232.56s)]
*  It was like a hot potato wanting to get rid of the suitcase of jewels back in the day. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TctDm1HE6Nc&t=234.68s)]
