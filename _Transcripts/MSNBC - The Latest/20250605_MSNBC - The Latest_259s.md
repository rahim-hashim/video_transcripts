# 'Terrifying': Humanitarian org reacts to Trump's travel ban on Afghanistan
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc)
*  Now, critics are indeed pushing back against Afghanistan being included on the president's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=0.0s)]
*  travel ban list. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=6.28s)]
*  That's because tens of thousands of Afghans worked, fought, and even died alongside American [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=8.0s)]
*  forces during the war. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=13.6s)]
*  And since the fall of the Taliban in 2021, roughly 200,000 of them have fled to the United [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=15.44s)]
*  States, fearful of reprisals because of their role in helping the U.S. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=21.48s)]
*  Sean Vandiver is president and chairman of Afghan EVAC, a humanitarian organization that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=26.12s)]
*  works to support and relocate Afghan friends and allies. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=31.64s)]
*  So, Sean, first and foremost, just your general reaction to this announcement from the president. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=35.52s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me on today, Chris. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=40.88s)]
*  Look, this executive order, when it came out, was terrifying, right? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=44.72s)]
*  Now, it gives with one hand and takes with another, right? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=48.64s)]
*  They have a full ban on 12 countries, including Afghanistan, but there is an exemption for [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=52.12s)]
*  Afghan SIV holders, and we understand their immediate family members. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=57.48s)]
*  But what they're not telling you in this executive order is that the Biden-era systems that move [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=62.4s)]
*  them to safety, care, the coordinator for Afghan relocation efforts, and enduring welcome, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=67.4s)]
*  the multiyear end-to-end policy that Afghan EVAC and veterans organizations all across [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=72.2s)]
*  this country worked with the Biden administration to build are being dismantled. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=76.24s)]
*  We can't claim to protect our allies while firing the people who helped them and shutting [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=81.04s)]
*  down pathways for their loved ones to get here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=85.48s)]
*  So where does this leave the people you work with? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=88.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  So, the people that we work with overseas are left scrambling. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  Yes, there's an exemption for SIVs here, but there's so much chaos, the order is very confusing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=96.04s)]
*  So people who have been waiting to reunify with their families for three and a half years [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=102.0s)]
*  don't know whether or not they're going to be included or not, because the Trump administration [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=106.04s)]
*  seems focused on injecting more chaos and more uncertainty. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=110.28s)]
*  And that limbo is what's killing folks, right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=114.8s)]
*  This ban blocks Afghan families from reuniting, spouses, kids, and fiancés of green card [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=116.6s)]
*  holders. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  Afghan students accepted into U.S. universities, diversity visa winners, fiancés of our U.S. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  citizens and lawful permanent residents are all people who are being shut out. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=129.72s)]
*  From what they don't say, they don't seem to care that enduring welcome is our safest, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=134.48s)]
*  most secure legal immigration pathway in our country's entire history. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=140.88s)]
*  But they don't like it because Joe Biden built it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=145.48s)]
*  Well, the president's justification, which you probably know for this move, is essentially [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  that the Taliban controls Afghanistan and therefore lacks, and I'm quoting here, competent [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=151.76s)]
*  or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents, and it does [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  not have appropriate screening and vetting measures. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=162.16s)]
*  Does he have a point? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=165.96s)]
*  No. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=166.96s)]
*  And here's why. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=167.96s)]
*  It's actually a few different things, right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=169.56s)]
*  One, this flies in the face of what Secretary Noem has been saying when she took away temporary [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=171.84s)]
*  protected status for Afghans, because they're saying it's safe, it's perfectly fine to go [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=176.68s)]
*  there, you're totally safe to go back to Afghanistan. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=181.04s)]
*  No worries, even though State Department has a level three, or level four travel advisory, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=183.32s)]
*  and they're saying that it's not safe to let people in from there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=188.16s)]
*  Also, enduring welcome, again, you can go to afghanevac.org slash vetting and see the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=191.32000000000002s)]
*  extraordinary measures that people have to go through to get here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=196.4s)]
*  There's no place in the world where we know more about the population than in Afghanistan. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=200.16s)]
*  We spent 20 years there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=204.52s)]
*  We have an extraordinary intelligence collection mechanism. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  This is not about security. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=210.22s)]
*  This is about political theater. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=211.44s)]
*  This thing was written weeks ago. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=213.12s)]
*  We helped break that this was on its way right at the beginning of the administration. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=214.68s)]
*  They had to back off because they didn't have a political excuse to do it, but now they're [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=219.64s)]
*  pointing at Boulder. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=224.24s)]
*  And earlier you mentioned that the guy that did that was Egyptian. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=225.64s)]
*  Egypt's not even on this list. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=229.24s)]
*  This is opportunism, plain and simple. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=231.88s)]
*  Sean Van Diver, an important conversation. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=235.28s)]
*  We thank you for joining us to have it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbnhd6xAQCc&t=237.48s)]
