# Creating MORE undocumented immigrants? How Trump's crackdown could backfire on his agenda
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU)
*  So, how are these Supreme Court decisions being processed by Latinos? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=0.0s)]
*  And particularly, I want to hear your take on folks in like the South Florida area, many [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=5.94s)]
*  of whom supported this president and, you know, may be feeling betrayed in some ways. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=11.24s)]
*  Now, tell me what you're hearing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=18.1s)]
*  So, I would say that was one of the big stories of 2024, right? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=19.1s)]
*  This idea that 45% of Latino voters voted for Donald Trump in a place like Miami-Dade [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=22.42s)]
*  County, which is where so many of these migrants are coming from. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=28.060000000000002s)]
*  Venezuelans, Cuban-Americans, and Nicaraguan Americans were, I would say, responsible for [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=31.220000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump flipping Miami-Dade County. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=36.86s)]
*  So, the way I see it is Donald Trump, in a way, wins that election because he cast himself [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=38.9s)]
*  as this anti-communist hero. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=44.38s)]
*  Now, he said himself that he was the victim of communism, and here he is, threatening [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=46.34s)]
*  to deport Cubans and Venezuelans back to these communist regimes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=51.3s)]
*  Here he is, threatening to deport Haitians back to a country that is so dangerous that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=56.699999999999996s)]
*  in 2024, over 5,000 people died because of gang violence. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=62.059999999999995s)]
*  And so, the question is, I'm not surprised at all. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=65.17999999999999s)]
*  I mean, this to me is not surprising at all that Donald Trump is doing something like [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=67.38s)]
*  this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=71.3s)]
*  Now, this is part of his larger plan, but the question is back to those Latinos that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=72.3s)]
*  you're talking about. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=75.5s)]
*  No, how will they react? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=76.5s)]
*  And when they see their fellow Cubans that fled from the very same countries that they [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=78.17999999999999s)]
*  fled from, will that change at all? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=82.34s)]
*  Will that make them think in any way? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=85.58s)]
*  And sadly, I'm not sure. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=87.26s)]
*  It's too late. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=89.1s)]
*  I mean, like, what are they going to do about it now? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=90.1s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=91.1s)]
*  They're going to, it's like you're just hoping that they're going to mobilize and vote in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=92.1s)]
*  the midterms. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=94.38s)]
*  We'll see in 2026, but, I mean, they can be out there protesting. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=95.38s)]
*  I mean, there's things to do. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=99.02s)]
*  Which they're not doing is what you're saying. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=100.98s)]
*  They're not out there yet. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=102.34s)]
*  Well, I mean, this just happened like a couple of days ago. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=103.34s)]
*  So, obviously, the momentum behind it, the organization behind it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=104.82s)]
*  Well, it did sort of happen a couple of days ago. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=107.42s)]
*  Well, specifically for Cubans, it just happened a couple of days ago. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=108.98s)]
*  Well, Trump has been trying to get this through for a while. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=111.74s)]
*  Just that the Supreme Court finally greenlit it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=113.94s)]
*  It's not like a surprise. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=116.34s)]
*  The thing with Cubans that's interesting is that Cubans have had a very different relationship [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=117.98s)]
*  with immigration because of this very privileged pathway to citizenship. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=123.38s)]
*  And so this is perhaps for the first time ever that Cubans are finding themselves part [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=127.5s)]
*  of the immigration debate. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=132.7s)]
*  Now, when they see that fellow Cubans like them are being deported and are being racially [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=133.7s)]
*  profiled and that's new. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=137.86s)]
*  And that's the question. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=139.1s)]
*  The person I actually really want to talk to about this would be Rubio. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=140.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=142.38s)]
*  Both of us are descendants of people who fled communism in Cuba. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=143.46s)]
*  And you know, Rubio speaks about what's happening in Cuba as an emergency, as a violation of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=147.42s)]
*  human rights. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=154.94s)]
*  So to in a way facilitate the return of your own people to a place that you say is unfit. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=156.38s)]
*  It's... [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=162.18s)]
*  Rubio was also one of the champions for Venezuelans in the Senate to get TPS. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=163.18s)]
*  And now... [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=167.74s)]
*  The immigration reform and he was with the Dreamers. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=168.74s)]
*  But that is, I mean, at this point... [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=170.7s)]
*  At this point he has sold his soul. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=172.78s)]
*  He has sold his soul to be a part of this administration, which I mean, it's something [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=176.02s)]
*  you and I have talked about, little Marco Rubio in the past. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  He was to all of the points that have been raised, somebody who took principled positions [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=182.46s)]
*  even in the war in Russia and Ukraine. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=185.98000000000002s)]
*  This was a guy who stood up to Russia. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=188.62s)]
*  And he did all of this for a seat at Donald Trump's power table. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=190.5s)]
*  He has this escalated investment in the Trump administration, right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=194.62s)]
*  So he was on the path of being a fairly decent person when he had to run for office and get [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=197.52s)]
*  elected. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=201.5s)]
*  And then as soon as he switched over and became Secretary of State, he's now looking at it [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=202.5s)]
*  as where am I most included? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  And where he's most included is in the seat of power that Trump wants him to continue [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=207.1s)]
*  to carry out. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=210.34s)]
*  What I'm more concerned about right now is the story that's not totally making it out [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=211.82s)]
*  there, which is that Marco Rubio announced that they're going to have an office of remigration. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=215.5s)]
*  That term remigration in 2019 when it first started coming up, the Associated Press called [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=219.94s)]
*  that akin to a soft ethnic cleansing. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=225.74s)]
*  It's the idea that you would deport anyone who does not uphold what Donald Trump considers [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=229.54s)]
*  to be Western values. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=234.14s)]
*  And you could go back as far as you want, as it was. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=236.1s)]
*  He was already trying to challenge birthright citizenship. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=237.86s)]
*  They were already on the birtherism thing all the way back to 2008. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=240.22s)]
*  So what I'm looking at is what Marco Rubio is doing with this office, who that will affect, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=243.7s)]
*  and how late is it for everyone? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=248.42000000000002s)]
*  Is he going to go back two generations? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=250.18s)]
*  Is he going to send my family back to Albania? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=251.18s)]
*  Like what will it be and who will be targeted next? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=253.38s)]
*  I also wonder about the people who are here following the law, coming in the right way, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=256.1s)]
*  all of the things that the MAGA people say that they want from immigrants. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=261.94s)]
*  They don't just hate all immigrants. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=265.5s)]
*  They just hate the criminals and the gang bangers, not the people who are coming in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  legally. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=271.26000000000005s)]
*  And yet we have besides these people in TPS or who were paroled in having their protections [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=272.26000000000005s)]
*  stripped away and their work permits stripped away, we also have people being arrested when [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=279.66s)]
*  they show up to court or show up to regular ICE immigration check-ins. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=283.48s)]
*  These are not the people that ICE needs to hunt down because they are criminals. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=289.12s)]
*  They are voluntarily showing up because that's what they're supposed to do. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=292.16s)]
*  They're following the law. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  What do you think this means for compliance? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=297.88s)]
*  It's going to drive people into the shadows, no? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=300.76s)]
*  Of course, yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=303.0s)]
*  It's logical. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=304.0s)]
*  These are people that in good faith are showing up to the courthouses. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=305.32s)]
*  They're abiding by the law. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=308.56s)]
*  And now, of course, they're scared to be snatched up and kidnapped by ICE. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=310.04s)]
*  But then if you're the Trump administration, you're thinking about two things. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=314.24s)]
*  Number one, you need those numbers to go up. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  They are obsessed with following through. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  $3,000 a day. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=321.6s)]
*  $3,000 a day. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=322.6s)]
*  But I think if you're Stephen Miller, what really, really bothers you is still this idea [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=323.92s)]
*  that Barack Obama will always win the label of being deporter in chief. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  And that really bothers them. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=332.6s)]
*  This idea that the Obama administration deported over 3 million undocumented immigrants, which [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=334.16s)]
*  means that that's around 1,000 undocumented immigrants being deported per day. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=338.72s)]
*  And so that is this obsession that someone like Stephen Miller has. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=343.96000000000004s)]
*  And then, and you've written about this, right, this idea that they have to sustain the moral [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=347.72s)]
*  panic that got them elected. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=352.36s)]
*  Now, this idea that it is that invasion, that invasion and those bad people, we as Americans [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=353.88000000000005s)]
*  need to protect ourselves from the other. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  So those detentions, those ICE rates, all of that is part of that narrative that sustains [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=361.08000000000004s)]
*  what got Donald Trump elected. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=366.56s)]
*  So I was going to say, V, we started, and you brought up a really good point about the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=368.64s)]
*  expansion of this remigration. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=371.79999999999995s)]
*  And ideologically speaking, it started with right now they're trying to find people who [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=374.96s)]
*  are undocumented. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=378.29999999999995s)]
*  And then it looks like it's going to permeate more into the area of what type of ideological [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=380.0s)]
*  people are in this country that we don't like. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=385.52s)]
*  And that's the dangerous slippery slope that we're going down. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm curious to get your thoughts on where do you see this rubbing up against the law [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=390.67999999999995s)]
*  at any point, because they're doing it first with green card holders whose speech they [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  don't like. Marco Rubio is saying, you know, like Mahmoud Khalil, you know, we don't like [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=399.6s)]
*  the way he spoke or led protests. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=403.76000000000005s)]
*  There's somebody who wrote an op-ed. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=405.72s)]
*  And it's doing it in an area where people are like, I don't know much about it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=407.48s)]
*  I don't want to weigh in on it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=409.68s)]
*  But it's going to slowly expand, as we saw this week with Chinese students in this country. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=410.68s)]
*  I think it's already coming out because it's not about coming here the right way. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=415.04s)]
*  It's coming here the right way and being the right type of immigrant that he has decided [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=418.20000000000005s)]
*  is going to fit into their narrow version of Western values. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=422.36s)]
*  Right. So now it's not students. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=426.0s)]
*  If you're coming here from China to study at Harvard and lend all of your research to [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=427.48s)]
*  the United States of America's betterment. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=432.0s)]
*  Now, that's not the right kind of immigrant. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=433.8s)]
*  If you're coming here as a doctor, if you're coming here as a worker, a lot of these folks [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  come and do essential jobs, construction, labor jobs, home care, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=439.32s)]
*  job, agriculture, that we're agriculture, that we're pulling people out of. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=444.12s)]
*  And there is no one to replace them. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0ut17CGPU&t=447.72s)]
