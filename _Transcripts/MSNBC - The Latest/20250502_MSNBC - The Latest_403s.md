# ‘We will have a crisis for the rule of law': Historian Jon Meacham on the second Trump term
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw)
*  Starting the day I take the oath of office, I will rapidly drive prices down and we will make America affordable again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=0.0s)]
*  We're going to make it affordable again. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=8.8s)]
*  Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=10.8s)]
*  And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=14.8s)]
*  How it started, how it's going. Trump made a lot of promises for his White House return. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=18.8s)]
*  So how does his first 100 days stack up against other former presidents? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=25.8s)]
*  We've got just the man to discuss this with, our friend historian John Meacham. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=29.8s)]
*  He's the Rogers Chair in the American presidency at Vanderbilt University. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=32.8s)]
*  Sir, your assessment of the first 100 days? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=36.8s)]
*  Well, it's an answer to what we think of as the first 100 days in the presidential vernacular of Franklin Roosevelt, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=42.8s)]
*  who became president at a time of enormous crisis for capitalism and for democracy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=49.8s)]
*  And he tried to build our way out of it in those 100 days. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=55.8s)]
*  This is in some ways a retort, which is an attempt to take apart a good bit of the, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=60.8s)]
*  not just the domestic order, but the international order that has been in place, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=68.8s)]
*  not simply in the Roosevelt years, but really all the way through the Obama years. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=75.8s)]
*  And there was an extraordinary bipartisan consensus, not necessarily about the details of policy, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=80.8s)]
*  but certainly about the basic role, the efficacy, the integrity of institutions. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=86.8s)]
*  And we're seeing a quite targeted, and we shall soon find out how effective, an assault on those institutions. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=93.8s)]
*  So you layer onto what is essentially the roadmap set out by Project 2025 [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=103.8s)]
*  to deconstruct the administrative state and slash a lot of the programs you just talked about. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=110.8s)]
*  And then you layer on Donald Trump's own idiosyncrasies and preferences. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=115.8s)]
*  You have three defense officials telling NBC News that the administration is planning a huge celebration [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=121.8s)]
*  for the Army and President Trump's birthday on June 14th, which could include military vehicles and aircraft. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=128.8s)]
*  And it comes as Trump is floating the idea of remaining Veterans Day to focus on our military victories. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=135.8s)]
*  As you know, well, sir, only Congress has the authority to create or change a federal holiday when you put that all together. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=141.8s)]
*  What does that tell you about where he sees his next 100 days going? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=149.8s)]
*  Well, he sees his next 100 days the way he's seen his last X number of days in life, which is that it is about him. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=155.8s)]
*  It's not about us. It's not about we, the people. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=164.8s)]
*  It's not about a world in which we try to fulfill the implications of the Declaration of Independence. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=168.8s)]
*  And this is not some reflexively partisan anti-Trump point. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=176.8s)]
*  It's simply the case. And we're not we don't do ourselves any favors. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=181.8s)]
*  We are, I think, doing our jobs as citizens if we don't call them as we see them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=186.8s)]
*  And what we've seen for the last decade and it's now been a decade is that we are living in an age of Trump. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=193.8s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=201.8s)]
*  He has set the terms of the debate and many people are defined now by their reaction to the terms he has set. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=203.8s)]
*  And I think what without any fear, really of serious contradiction, I think we can say that he is taking a cult of personality. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=212.8s)]
*  He has used that to take over a major political party. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=224.8s)]
*  And he is now in his second term of trying to make the world in his image as opposed to an image where we can all figure out a way to live lives of prosperity and purpose. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=231.8s)]
*  And it's a remarkable thing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=246.8s)]
*  No American president has ever held this kind of grip, has ever had this kind of grip on the American imagination. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=248.8s)]
*  And I don't like saying things are unprecedented. It's against my business model. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=256.8s)]
*  But in this case, in this case, it is unprecedented. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=261.8s)]
*  It is, in fact, unprecedented. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=265.8s)]
*  And I think about your point about how his first 100 days are a retort to FDR's first 100 days and how there was sort of a building. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=267.8s)]
*  And here we've seen a deconstruction. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=274.8s)]
*  The question, and I keep coming back to John Meacham, is what it would take to rebuild what has already been deconstructed, right? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=275.8s)]
*  What a post-doge America, what a post deconstructing of the global order looks like and requires of America and Americans? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=284.8s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=296.8s)]
*  And the way I go through every day now is trying to figure out what of what we're seeing has the likeliest chance to be dispositive precedent, which sounds fancy. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=298.8s)]
*  But what do we in this climate, what is seasonal and what's chronic? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=311.8s)]
*  And we just don't quite know yet. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=318.8s)]
*  We haven't really faced, I think, what will be the defining crisis, which will be the president either accepting a contrary decision, likely from the Supreme Court on an issue of great significance or trying to reject it and trying to defy it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=320.8s)]
*  And that moment is coming. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=337.8s)]
*  You know, the word crisis comes from the Greek vernacular about health care. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=340.8s)]
*  Crisis is the moment in a disease where a patient lives or dies and don't want to be overly hyperbolic on a Friday evening. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=345.8s)]
*  But we will have a crisis for the rule of law, I think, before this year is out. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=355.8s)]
*  And here's hoping that the institutions, the judges, the lawmakers and the citizens hold on to that rule of law, no matter what their impulses at the moment might be. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=361.8s)]
*  I appreciate that you didn't want to sound too fancy, but then gave me the etymology of the word crisis. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=373.8s)]
*  John Meacham, as always, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYIZOh7Qxw&t=378.8s)]
