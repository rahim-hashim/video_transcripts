# 'We have zero ships': Seattle port chief sounds alarm on the impact of Trump’s tariffs
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q)
*  All right, literally minutes ago we got Donald Trump's reaction to today's first round of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=0.0s)]
*  trade talks with China. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=7.66s)]
*  Trump just posted that it was quote a very good meeting and a total reset negotiated [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=9.36s)]
*  in a friendly but constructive manner. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=15.02s)]
*  The meeting comes as the very first Chinese goods that were hit with Trump's 145 percent [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=17.3s)]
*  tariffs started arriving at US ports yesterday. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  Here are just some of the companies with products on those ships. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  Amazon, Home Depot, IKEA, Ralph Lauren and Tractor Supply. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=28.1s)]
*  In other words, a lot of places where a lot of people shop. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=32.32s)]
*  Meanwhile though, Seattle was still seeing a slump at the shipping docks this week. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=35.72s)]
*  Seattle Port Commissioner Ryan Culkin said on Thursday, we currently have no container ships. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=40.5s)]
*  And Port of Seattle Commissioner Ryan Culkin joins me now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=47.3s)]
*  Commissioner, it's great to have you with us. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=52.42s)]
*  First of all, have any ships started arriving or is it still pretty empty? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=53.82s)]
*  What's your assessment of the situation right now? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=57.82s)]
*  We had a couple of ships come in yesterday on load and then depart. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=60.96s)]
*  And so once again, as of today, we have zero ships at the at verse right now at the Port [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=64.06s)]
*  of Seattle. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=69.14s)]
*  Our sister port in Tacoma currently has one ship as well as a as a railroad carrier and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=70.14s)]
*  it's a car carrier. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=75.22s)]
*  Trump had this to say on Thursday when when asked about the slowdown. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=78.62s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=83.1s)]
*  As business has slowed down, as you mentioned, we're seeing but we're seeing as a result, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=86.1s)]
*  the ports here in the US, the traffic has really slowed and now thousands of dock workers [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=91.1s)]
*  and truck drivers are worried about their jobs. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=96.97999999999999s)]
*  That means we lose less money. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=100.66s)]
*  You know, when I see that, that means we lose less money. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=101.66s)]
*  So Commissioner, what is your response to that analysis of the economic situation? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  What do you think the knock on effects of the slowdown in port traffic will be? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=111.46s)]
*  Well, I think the slowdown in port traffic is going to have real impacts for working [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=117.66s)]
*  families around the country, not only just at the ports where we see fewer longshore [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=121.25999999999999s)]
*  workers coming in, fewer truck drivers coming to pick up loads, fewer trains coming in to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=126.86s)]
*  pick up containers and take them into inland areas like Chicago and Des Moines. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=133.26s)]
*  It's going to have real impacts. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=137.74s)]
*  Unfortunately, the longer the dispute carries on, the longer the disruption for American [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=139.22s)]
*  consumers and American workers will be. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=144.73999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, just the other day, the CEO of Vizion, which tracks trade, Tulsi NBC, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=148.54s)]
*  this we haven't seen anything like this since the disruptions of the summer of 2020. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=154.17999999999998s)]
*  That means goods expected to arrive the next six to eight weeks simply won't. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  With tariffs driving costs higher, small businesses are pausing orders and so on. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=164.1s)]
*  I think for a lot of Americans, it's quite scary to hear any kind of comparison to the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=168.86s)]
*  pandemic to 2020. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  Would you say that that's accurate in terms of the sort of the risk, the emergency [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=176.9s)]
*  urgency here? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=181.38s)]
*  I do think so. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=183.82s)]
*  Now, I do want to say that a lot of American businesses were very smart in anticipating [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  a tariff disruption. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=190.94s)]
*  And so they did a great job of building up inventory in anticipation of potential Trump [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=192.34s)]
*  tariffs. But that's only going to tide us over so long. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=197.74s)]
*  And we know that factories have have shuttered in China. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=201.5s)]
*  We know that year over year exports from China went down in April by 20 percent. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=206.34s)]
*  Keep in mind that for most of April, they were still able to to get goods on ships and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=212.38s)]
*  to us so that if something had left by the time these tariffs were implemented and were [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=218.78s)]
*  on a ship on the way to the United States, they would still land tariff free. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=223.5s)]
*  Now we're fully into a period where if it's leaving China now, it's going to be hit with [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=227.29999999999998s)]
*  that one hundred and forty five percent tariff. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=231.17999999999998s)]
*  So I'm hoping that these talks in Switzerland this week will result in fruitful negotiations [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=232.82s)]
*  that we can get commerce moving again, because sincerely, there is no greater beneficiary [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=239.38s)]
*  of an open and liberal marketplace on the world stage than the United States. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=245.98s)]
*  It has led to tremendous prosperity for us, both our businesses and farmers who export, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  but also American consumers who benefit from the opportunity to buy goods that are produced [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=255.98s)]
*  elsewhere at cheaper rates. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=260.94s)]
*  What goods would normally be coming over around now? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=263.46s)]
*  Is it Christmas products? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=266.98s)]
*  What would normally be coming in that's not arriving? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=268.62s)]
*  Well, you can imagine that the supply chain can take months, three to six months for a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=273.54s)]
*  wholesaler or retailer to place an order, have it manufactured, put on a ship, brought [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=279.38s)]
*  over and then distributed to their warehouses around the country. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=284.5s)]
*  So, you know, if you work back from that right now, the inventories are being built up for [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=287.5s)]
*  back to school sales for the fall and in not too distant future, they're going to start [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=293.94s)]
*  planning for the Christmas season. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=298.94s)]
*  So if they don't have the certainty of a tariff rate that's locked in, that is, I mean, on [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=300.22s)]
*  quite honestly, one hundred and forty five percent, we're not going to be buying anything [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=308.1s)]
*  from China. But if this dispute doesn't end soon, it will [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=310.82s)]
*  make it very difficult for retailers like the ones you mentioned at the top of the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=314.38s)]
*  segment to do business planning around that kind of holiday rush. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=318.9s)]
*  Commissioner, we're almost out of time, but I want to just ask you really quickly, how [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=324.54s)]
*  irreversible is this? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=328.14s)]
*  I mean, there's a concern that once these products don't arrive to the U.S., if China [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=329.54s)]
*  finds a new market and starts opening new markets for these products, it becomes harder [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=333.5s)]
*  for us here in the U.S. to access those goods. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=338.18s)]
*  Do you think that is a long term concern or do you believe that this is something that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=340.62s)]
*  is irreversible if these talks in Switzerland succeed? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=344.82s)]
*  Well, my concern right now is the immediate impacts. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=350.02s)]
*  But secondarily, I'm afraid that if we don't have inventory on store shelves, that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=354.38s)]
*  retailers are going to have to start thinking about layoffs and other actions to [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=360.38s)]
*  preserve cash as businesses. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=366.38s)]
*  And if they do that, that will contribute to a cycle that could lead to recession. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=368.18s)]
*  And so if we don't resolve this quickly, we might see ourselves tip into recession, which [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=373.78000000000003s)]
*  will have even greater implications than just the trade war. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=379.18s)]
*  Commissioner Ryan Calkins, thank you so much for joining us tonight. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qgpryc_8Q&t=383.34000000000003s)]
