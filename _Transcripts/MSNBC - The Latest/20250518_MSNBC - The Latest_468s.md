# ‘Where did he make this?’: Fmr. FBI official breaks down Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM)
*  All right, everybody they are wrapping up that press conference there and the man you see there to the right of your screen that is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=0.0s)]
*  the deceased [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=5.72s)]
*  Believed suspect there that is 25 year old guy Edward Barkas of 29 palms [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=7.4s)]
*  That is a neighboring community of Palm Desert about an hour or so away from the Palm Springs area there in the desert [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=12.88s)]
*  Lots of information to unpack there, but let me right now speak with NBC's Camila Bernal and Rob D'Amico [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=20.12s)]
*  We're gonna bring you back in as well my friend former FBI supervisor [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=26.96s)]
*  So Camila to you first for those people who don't know the Palm Springs area. I mean give a description of it [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=29.680000000000003s)]
*  I will say I'm from Southern, California. I know it [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  I know it to be a very lively at times area spring breakers for example [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  My godmother lives neighboring in Palm Desert when I heard about this yesterday while we were on the air. I was stunned [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=44.0s)]
*  I said Palm Springs [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=51.52s)]
*  This kind of thing does not happen there [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=54.32s)]
*  No, and this is obviously an area with great weather [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=59.0s)]
*  So you have a lot of visitors from all over the country and really all over the world and even when I spoke to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  One of the employees at the clinic yesterday [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=67.56s)]
*  She told me that a lot of the people that actually go to this clinic are [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=69.44s)]
*  From out of town because they're here spending a large portion of their winter or just a large portion of the year here [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=73.36s)]
*  So you get a lot of visitors you get people who are very welcoming you heard from the press conference a lot of the local [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=80.92s)]
*  Officials saying that this is obviously a great place to be telling people to snap pictures and show everyone else how nice [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=86.66s)]
*  Palm Springs is so this is obviously not something that they were [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  Anticipating but one of the things that they made very clear was that essentially the good guys won here [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=97.88s)]
*  And they were able to keep the embryo safe [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=103.72s)]
*  We just heard that all four of the people that were injured had been released from the hospital [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=106.6s)]
*  So really just positive news coming out of this press conference as they did connect the dots in terms of the suspect [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=110.96s)]
*  The one thing they are asking from the public right now is to help them figure out what [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=117.0s)]
*  This suspect was doing right before the blast [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=122.4s)]
*  They say he got to Palm Springs at 6 in the morning and they're asking people to look at the picture [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=125.44s)]
*  To maybe identify his car to see exactly where he went or what he was doing right up to the moment [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=130.88s)]
*  That he went to that clinic and essentially blew himself up in that car [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=136.64s)]
*  Indeed and that brings me to a question for you Rob that that timeline they're trying to establish within Palm Springs [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  They said they knew where he was at 6 a.m. They have an ability to track when he entered the city [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=148.04s)]
*  Maybe that's from cameras and the like but until he got to that parking lot that we're showing our viewers right now [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  Why do they need that information? Is it to perhaps rule out the possibility of an accomplice? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=160.16s)]
*  Well, that's one of them but I think the the bigger one is where did he build this device? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  Because that can be a dangerous area if he left chemicals out if he did things and the evidence trail that goes with it [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  So did he build it at that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  29 palms location or was some of it in a storage garage somewhere and that's a dangerous thing that they have to figure out [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=183.32000000000002s)]
*  So they have to figure out a time frame of when he started making his movement [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=189.88000000000002s)]
*  They're going to piece his back. This was initial one. It might have been a license plate reader [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=195.44000000000003s)]
*  It might have been a camera that had some [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=199.74s)]
*  That was quickly gathered that they they ID the car or the the suspect on that put him at that 6 a.m [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  But now they're going to start taking in a lot of information people's ring cameras and other things [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=209.64s)]
*  And that's why they gave the description the car the license plate so people can ID it on [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  Personal devices that are collecting images and videos so they're going to start piecing together [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  But I think the biggest thing is where did he make this because there's some damage dangerous chemicals [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  They they did the safety sweep at the place in 29 palms [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  Obviously we haven't heard if there was anything left there because a lot of these people [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=235.88s)]
*  Like they'll bug they'll [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=242.44s)]
*  Trap their own home knowing the police are gonna come there and then booby trap killed by accident [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=245.32s)]
*  Like he way they talked about live streaming it was it going to be a live stream with his demise? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=250.88s)]
*  Because there was talk about him doing a video and him having some [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=256.48s)]
*  Suicidal thoughts that turned in it so they really have the piece was he looking at to do something else [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=262.48s)]
*  Where did he make the device did he leave chemicals that are dangerous somewhere? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=267.88s)]
*  Or there's even materials that are unstable based on what they find out from the explosion [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=271.40000000000003s)]
*  And they said that they had attempted to live stream and again [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=276.92s)]
*  He was someone that had been described as being depressed had some sort of relationship problem again only 25 years old [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=279.96000000000004s)]
*  But with regard to that bomb [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  When you have something that is able to go [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  250 yards that's two and a half lengths of a football field and have [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=293.4s)]
*  Phenomenal amounts of debris in that area [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=298.64s)]
*  What kinds of chemicals are they that are able to put a bomb like that together? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=300.96s)]
*  And you bring up a good point when they're trying to figure out where this Ford Fusion car went once it entered into Palm Springs [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  Are these the kinds of chemicals that can just be placed in the backseat of a car and be driven around? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  Without fear of them somehow mixing together and creating a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  explosion that way [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=323.68s)]
*  This wasn't just chemicals [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=325.44s)]
*  This was like more of like an ammonium nitrate something that you saw like in Oklahoma City bombing where there has to be an explosion [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=327.08s)]
*  It's it's not a quick chemical reaction that can cause that type of movement [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=333.88s)]
*  I've been around a bunch of these in Iraq and Afghanistan, you know single vehicle devices VB IDs used to call them vehicle-borne IEDs [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=338.08s)]
*  And then the explosion, you know happens because when you look at the movement of the building and the blast [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=346.4s)]
*  From that and the FBI agents go through the bomb techs [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=352.88s)]
*  I'm I think the bomb techs probably within an hour knew what kind of device was used just by the chemical analysis on the scene [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=356.12s)]
*  they'll have to pare it down into [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=364.24s)]
*  certain things but the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  Traces that are left there and they go through a school called post blasts even regular agents go through it [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=369.36s)]
*  It's at Quantico the explosive unit does it with the FBI and they bring the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=374.6s)]
*  Agents and police in and they teach them about these devices and then they start blowing them up in different sizes [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  You can hear him at Quantico all the time going off [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=386.04s)]
*  And then they start looking at what's left from each device so they can understand [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  What happens when you blow something up in an open field and there's nothing around it. This one had a building [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=394.2s)]
*  So as you see there was a big explosion on the one side [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=400.34000000000003s)]
*  But then it ripped through and you saw all the debris on the the street out front [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=403.54s)]
*  That was the you know, the post blasts of it going through the building and out [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=408.14s)]
*  So people not understanding how a device works the bomb techs and the agents there are doing all that right now [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=413.3s)]
*  But I think probably within a couple hours [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=420.02s)]
*  They understood what chemicals were used because it does leave so much traces of it and they're very good at at figuring that out quickly [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=422.26s)]
*  Well, we are indeed showing people the aftermath of this bomb which is the FBI said believed to be the largest bombing [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=428.94s)]
*  Investigation the FBI has ever been involved in in Southern, California [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=435.3s)]
*  So that is notable in itself Camila Brunel and Rob D'Amico [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=438.98s)]
*  Thank you both for joining us through the top of this hour and the breaking news developments there in Palm Springs [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=443.58s)]
*  You [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gew8z8Ii6rM&t=458.82s)]
