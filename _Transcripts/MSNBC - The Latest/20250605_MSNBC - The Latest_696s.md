# Nicolle Wallace: Elon Musk and Donald Trump public feud is 'two tarantulas in a bowl'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4)
*  The alliance between the world's richest man and the world's most powerful Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=0.0s)]
*  is imploding right now in real time before our very eyes, with Trump and Musk tearing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=5.64s)]
*  into each other inside the Oval Office and online. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=11.08s)]
*  It appears that Elon Musk, after donating $277 million of his own money to the Trump [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=14.96s)]
*  campaign after serving as Donald Trump's political heat shield for the first five months of his [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=20.88s)]
*  second presidency, did so while doing permanent damage to his business empire, to the federal [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=25.84s)]
*  government and his personal reputation and legacy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=31.6s)]
*  But after all that, even Elon Musk is not immune from the golden rule that for Trump, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  loyalty is a one-way street. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=41.36s)]
*  But Musk is not going quietly into the night. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=44.1s)]
*  After days of Musk trashing Donald Trump's signature domestic policy, his big ugly bill [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=48.16s)]
*  as Elon Musk called it, Trump finally broke his silence. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=55.44s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=59.28s)]
*  Trump Trump knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=60.28s)]
*  And he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=65.52s)]
*  the EV mint. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=68.72s)]
*  He knew every aspect of this bill. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=70.0s)]
*  He knew it better than almost anybody. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=71.72s)]
*  And he never had a problem until right after he left. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=74.12s)]
*  He said the most beautiful things about me. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=77.08s)]
*  And he hasn't said bad about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=79.14s)]
*  Well, Trump is right about that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=84.0s)]
*  That is indeed what is happening next. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=86.56s)]
*  Musk is now a former special government employee with basically the same status as the rest [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=89.92s)]
*  of us, a private citizen who can post all of his big feelings on the Internet, is doing [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=95.64s)]
*  just that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=100.6s)]
*  He is lashing out, reminding his 220 million followers on the platform he owns, X, of his [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=101.6s)]
*  potentially decisive 277 million dollar political gift to Donald Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=108.72s)]
*  He writes this quote, Without me, Trump would have lost the election. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=114.72s)]
*  Democrats would control the House and Republicans would be 51 49 in the Senate. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=118.64s)]
*  Musk went on to say, quote, all caps, such ingratitude. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=123.36s)]
*  It went on and on and on. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=128.48s)]
*  Trump even threatened to cancel Musk's billions of dollars worth of contracts to which Musk [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=130.8s)]
*  fired back, accusing Donald Trump of wait for it, covering up his role in the Epstein [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=135.96s)]
*  files. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=142.16s)]
*  Yes, Elon Musk went there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=143.16s)]
*  The Epstein files. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  Now, the Epstein files are government documents from the investigation into the disgraced [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  It animates. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=155.56s)]
*  It takes up a lot of heat and energy on the right. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=156.56s)]
*  But as sordid as this all is and it gets worse, let's stop here for a second. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=159.52s)]
*  Why does any of this matter? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=164.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=166.68s)]
*  Two tarantulas in a bowl. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=167.68s)]
*  Why does it matter? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=168.68s)]
*  Well, here's why. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=169.68s)]
*  When the most powerful person in our government fights with the richest person in the world, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=170.68s)]
*  we as a public get to peer deep inside the most corrupt and superficial alliance in American [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=177.04s)]
*  political history. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=184.72s)]
*  And as they claw and strike rhetorically at one another, they affirm our deepest concerns [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=187.08s)]
*  and suspicions. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=193.16s)]
*  Trump confirms that Musk was always only in it to enrich his companies. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=195.16s)]
*  And Musk confirms that Trump was always for sale. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=200.2s)]
*  So where we start today with some of our favorite reporters and friends, New York Times correspondent [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=203.6s)]
*  Teddy Schleifer is here also joining us, the president of Media Matters for America, Angelo [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=208.32s)]
*  Carisone and with me at the table for the hour, New York Times editorial board member [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=212.84s)]
*  MSNBC political analyst, Margay. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=217.2s)]
*  Teddy, I got to start with Elon Musk, who seems to have won round one by invoking the Epstein [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=219.84s)]
*  files. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  What gives? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  Is that a KO here? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  You say they were Jeffrey Epstein and suddenly... [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  On the right, I think it is. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  And maybe give some of the backstory. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=236.32s)]
*  The Times has had pretty detailed reporting on this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=238.84s)]
*  For the right, this is a conundrum for Bondi and Bongino and Patel, who now have access [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=242.04s)]
*  to the actual government files and are having a hard time tamping down some of the conspiracies [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=248.32s)]
*  farther to the right than those three individuals. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=254.68s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=257.24s)]
*  I mean, you know, the fact that Elon went there, as you put it, you know, the speed [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=258.24s)]
*  by which this has disintegrated to Jeffrey Epstein is a marvel, including to some of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=264.56s)]
*  Elon's own friends who I've been in touch with throughout the day today, you know, who [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=271.16s)]
*  are shocked that, you know, people that I texted at 12 o'clock by 2 o'clock, you know, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=274.52000000000004s)]
*  their phones are dropping and their mouths are agape. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  Clearly, this is, you know, only going to get worse, at least for the rest of the day. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=286.04s)]
*  You know, this partnership, people forget, is not that old, which makes it kind of easy [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=292.24s)]
*  to tear asunder. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=299.76s)]
*  It is not as if these are two old friends who go back decades and they're having a [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  tough day. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=305.08s)]
*  They really didn't know each other until about a year ago. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=306.08s)]
*  They, you know, spent basically no time together until Elon moved to Mar-a-Lago during the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=308.36s)]
*  presidential transition. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  So there's not this, like, bank of goodwill for either of them to kind of fall, call upon [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  when times get tough. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=321.84s)]
*  Angelo, we should say as a news organization, we have no reporting to back up or explain [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=324.36s)]
*  what Elon Musk is tweeting about. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=331.88s)]
*  But Elon Musk finds himself in a financial and reputational ditch today. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=334.16s)]
*  Let me show you what Scott Galloway had to say about Elon Musk's legacy right now. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  I think his legacy is not going to be an EV or putting rockets into space. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=346.8s)]
*  I think it's going to be unnecessary death, disease and disability of the world's most [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=351.8s)]
*  vulnerable. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=357.48s)]
*  That is not what it means to be an innovator. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=358.48s)]
*  It's not what it means to be an American. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=360.64000000000004s)]
*  It's not what it means to be a man. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  So speaking of going there, Scott Galloway going straight to something Elon seems to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  prize, his manliness. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=369.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=372.68s)]
*  I mean, and I think that sort of gets to part of what we're seeing here play out, right? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=373.68s)]
*  Which is that you have two of these right-wing fever swarm creatures battling with each other, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  like you said, tarantulas in a bowl. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=381.32s)]
*  And it's worth the sort of like there's a history to sort of see how where this goes [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=383.64s)]
*  and how this plays out. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=386.88s)]
*  One of the things that struck me at least immediately is that this is not the first [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=387.88s)]
*  time Trump has done this or that there's been this tension point. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=391.48s)]
*  Let's not forget that one of the first things Trump did in his ascent to power the first [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=393.88s)]
*  time around was break Fox News, was leapfrog the editorial control that the Murdochs had [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=398.2s)]
*  over that network and get directly to the audience. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=404.24s)]
*  There was a point in time when he was boycotting Fox News, when he was pumping up alternative [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=406.76s)]
*  programming and because he understands that any anything that has influence or control [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=410.8s)]
*  or disproportionate control over the zeitgeist will be a real meaningful check to his power, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=415.88s)]
*  especially because it's populist driven. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=421.72s)]
*  So it's important for him to be able to break it so that he can maintain the agenda setting [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=423.32s)]
*  power over the larger right-wing media ecosystem. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=428.64s)]
*  This must dispute though is different. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=431.6s)]
*  And it gets to the point that you raised initially, which is that there's a lot of toxic masculinity [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=432.8s)]
*  here unfolding, a lot of masculinity, a lot of sort of high on their own supply. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=436.8s)]
*  They've sort of built these characters. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=440.68s)]
*  It's like these WWE stars suddenly, you know, live the role so long that they no longer [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=442.28000000000003s)]
*  able to separate their real identity from the fictional character that they played. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=449.48s)]
*  As a result of that, they act in public life in ways that are aligned with what their character [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=453.44s)]
*  does. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=458.32s)]
*  And what does that mean when you have a game of chicken like this? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=459.32s)]
*  Well, right now it's just words. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=461.4s)]
*  I think sometimes Democrats in the Beltway media can get a little too excited. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=463.32s)]
*  You know, schadenfreude is not a strategy. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=466.6s)]
*  We can enjoy it, but that does not mean that anything has fundamentally changed. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=468.1s)]
*  They're saying nasty things to each other. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=471.86s)]
*  Donald Trump threatened to nuke, you know, North Korea, and then they were writing beautiful [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=473.38s)]
*  letters to each other. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=477.54s)]
*  So the words, I want to just say that nothing meaningful has happened yet. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=478.54s)]
*  They haven't done anything. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=482.66s)]
*  Elon Musk hasn't tipped his scans on that little algorithm scale and given a multiplier [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=483.66s)]
*  or started limiting or depressing the content of sort of Trump and Trump allies yet, right? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=488.26000000000005s)]
*  He hasn't tried to tip the scales. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=494.74s)]
*  He's identified some fractures and some soft spots, and he said he's willing to hit them, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=496.34s)]
*  but they haven't done anything yet. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=500.17999999999995s)]
*  And vice versa. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=501.53999999999996s)]
*  Trump has threatened. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=502.53999999999996s)]
*  They haven't done anything yet. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=503.53999999999996s)]
*  And I think that to me is the core here, is that you have two people that are deeply tied [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=504.73999999999995s)]
*  into this zeitgeist that believe that feminism has somehow eroded the testosterone and masculinity [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=509.46s)]
*  of men. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=515.18s)]
*  That is the audience they are speaking to. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=516.18s)]
*  And that is the audience that they're so deeply connected with that I think ultimately what [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=519.18s)]
*  it means is that I don't know if they can stop this game of chicken. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=523.3s)]
*  I don't know where the checks are or the mechanisms that slow this down, given that the audience [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=527.9s)]
*  here is not the traditional political calculus, but it is the fever swamp that these creatures [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=533.3399999999999s)]
*  come from. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=539.64s)]
*  And there are no checks there. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=541.12s)]
*  One of them is going to have to act first, and that's going to lead to a cycle. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=542.3s)]
*  Well, Angela, let me just push back respectfully. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=546.2199999999999s)]
*  The insurrection, no one does anything except use words. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=550.3s)]
*  Words like, I didn't lose. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=554.4599999999999s)]
*  The election was stolen from me. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=556.0s)]
*  So there are acts, the most sprawling investigation in the history of the United States Department [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=557.2199999999999s)]
*  of Justice emanates from words. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=563.26s)]
*  And these aren't just words. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=565.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, Elon Musk's last barb on the media platform, he controls, and I'd be shocked [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=567.14s)]
*  if he wasn't manipulating an algorithm to make sure that everybody sees what he tweeted [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=572.78s)]
*  about Trump and the Epstein files. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=577.34s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to dismiss that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=579.0600000000001s)]
*  You're right. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=581.0600000000001s)]
*  The words are very significant because they lead to external actions. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=582.0600000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the part that's so critical here, is that Musk, because he is so deeply [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=584.1s)]
*  tied into this, he knew exactly where to hit. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=588.98s)]
*  And that Epstein files, you had to have Teddy explain that, right? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=593.1800000000001s)]
*  Because many in the audience here don't really even understand how significant that is to [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=596.34s)]
*  The very base that Trump and Musk are both speaking to and lobbying for support from, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=602.98s)]
*  because they are going to take that support for their political power. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=608.78s)]
*  That is part of how Trump came to power, is that he organized power. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=612.66s)]
*  It used to be considered the fringes. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=615.06s)]
*  So I don't want to diminish the power of words. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=616.34s)]
*  I'm not trying to suggest that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=617.86s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is that this is only the beginning. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=619.38s)]
*  And these words have so far laid out the soft spots and the fractures. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=622.46s)]
*  But I don't know where the check is or the guard to stop them from taking additional [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=626.7s)]
*  action, from stopping Trump from saying, you know what, we are going to review the security [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=630.2199999999999s)]
*  clearance of Musk, given all the reporting, which hasn't really happened yet. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=635.38s)]
*  With Musk starting to threaten government space launches with these contracts, or to start [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=640.26s)]
*  tweaking the algorithm, or to start promoting antagonists of Donald Trump in meaningful [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=644.9799999999999s)]
*  ways. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=649.06s)]
*  The government is so worried about TikTok, right, because they can influence the ecosystem [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=650.06s)]
*  and the political contours. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=654.5s)]
*  Well, Twitter has the same potential. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=655.9399999999999s)]
*  If you start to tinker with it in similar ways. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=659.5400000000001s)]
*  So that's what I was referring to, is that they've only just begun. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=661.38s)]
*  And the very landscape, that masculinity piece that you sort of started out at the beginning, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=664.74s)]
*  prevents them from backing away from the ledge right now. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=668.98s)]
*  There's not a referee. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=672.1s)]
*  There's not an arbiter. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=673.1s)]
*  It's not clear how it stops. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtEK9hvYo4&t=674.1s)]
