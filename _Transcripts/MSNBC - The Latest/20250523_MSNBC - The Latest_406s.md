# Trump Tariff Turmoil: Markets roiled by threats on E.U. and Apple
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8)
*  Some breaking news right now markets are down after President Trump escalated [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=0.0s)]
*  his trade war this morning. In his first salvo the president threatened Apple [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=5.7s)]
*  CEO Tim Cook with a 25% tariff unless his company begins manufacturing iPhones [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=9.96s)]
*  in the US. Moments later the president threatened a blanket 50% tariff on [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=15.56s)]
*  imports from the European Union claiming trade discussions are going [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=20.44s)]
*  quote nowhere. That new number is up from Trump's initial 30% tariff on the EU [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=25.12s)]
*  from Liberation Day back in April. And this hour US trade representative James [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=31.04s)]
*  Ingraham is expected to speak with his European trade counterpart. Let's get [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=35.8s)]
*  more on all of this with NBC News senior business correspondent Christine [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=39.84s)]
*  Romans and Jared Bernstein former chairman of the Council of Economic [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=43.0s)]
*  Advisors in the Biden administration. Alright thank you guys both for being [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  with us. Christine let's just start with the European Union threats that we're [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=50.64s)]
*  seeing. Talk to us about the potential impact here and you point out that this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=55.52s)]
*  threat is even above and beyond that initial tariff that he had put in place. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=58.96s)]
*  Remember when the president went in the Rose Garden on so-called Liberation Day [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=63.36s)]
*  on April 2nd and he rolled out these huge numbers of tariffs against friend [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=66.56s)]
*  and foe alike for the United States. This number that he's threatening in this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  truth social post is larger than that pause tariff from April 2nd so that's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=74.68s)]
*  getting an awful lot of attention here. And the president's saying and his [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=79.68s)]
*  Treasury secretary saying on the television earlier this morning that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=84.56s)]
*  this is not really not a great negotiation so far. Now we know [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=88.2s)]
*  there's already a call scheduled for today so the president's truth [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  social post, his Treasury secretary on TV, two other people in the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=97.28s)]
*  administration are going to be talking to the European Union. Who knows if this [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=101.56s)]
*  is a negotiating ploy or a negotiating move from the White House but what moves [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=104.92s)]
*  is the market jerks around whenever frankly there are these stops and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=110.36s)]
*  starts in negotiations. Let's listen to what the Treasury secretary said earlier [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  today. I believe the president believes that the EU proposals have not been of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=118.2s)]
*  the same quality that we've seen from our other important trading partners. I [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=125.04s)]
*  would hope that this would light a fire under the EU because Bill I've said [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=129.28s)]
*  before EU has a collective action problem here. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=133.32s)]
*  Jared what is your reaction to what we're hearing from this administration [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=136.56s)]
*  this power play how do you expect European officials to respond? I think [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  this is just yet another unfortunate incident of these folks being in way [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=146.32s)]
*  over their heads not understanding the relationship between global trade, what's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=150.56s)]
*  fair, what's unfair, impact on markets, on businesses. You know I just checked the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=156.32s)]
*  Russell 2000 we don't talk about that enough that's a small cap index [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=161.24s)]
*  reflecting smaller businesses it's down 12% since inauguration day that's a real [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=165.72s)]
*  problem for small businesses. Here's something I didn't hear from anybody [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=170.72s)]
*  today in the administration including the clip you just played. What's wrong [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=174.52s)]
*  with our trading relationship with Europe with the EU? What precisely are [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=178.68s)]
*  they doing that's so unfair? If we were talking about China I myself could give [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=183.8s)]
*  you a list of ways in which they're unfairly dumping excess capacity in our [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=188.04s)]
*  economy that really warrant some pushback but no one has articulated how [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=192.48s)]
*  the EU is ripping us off that's Trump's term in trade terms and I didn't hear it [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=198.76s)]
*  from Bessette now I've never heard it. Our trade with Europe is mutually [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  beneficial there is there are barriers on both sides perhaps they can come down [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=208.88s)]
*  a point or two but this is this is a non-problem that this administration is [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=214.56s)]
*  elevated to in fact a fairly deep problem. And let's turn to the president's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=219.96s)]
*  25% tariff increase on Apple products this threat. Christine can the president [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=224.76s)]
*  legally just enact a tariff on one company and certain products? So he would [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=230.04s)]
*  have to zero in on the tariff code for India and smartphones because what we [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=235.84s)]
*  know is that Apple has said that it's US bound smartphones they want to source [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=240.64s)]
*  them more in India and away from China they've been moving away from China and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=245.92s)]
*  the president has complained that's not good enough he wants them made in the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  United States Tim Cook has explained that the workforce the size of the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  workforce the availability of the workforce the investments you need in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  the United States are very very difficult it's more efficient to do it [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=260.06s)]
*  the way Apple has done it and you know one analyst this morning Dan Ives who's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=264.21999999999997s)]
*  closely follows this company says it's a absolute fairy tale to think you're [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=268.44s)]
*  gonna make iPhones in the United States and if you were somehow to be able to as [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=272.52s)]
*  he says sprinkle pixie dust and make them they cost more than $3,500 a piece [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=276.96s)]
*  and there wouldn't be you know it's just this is the most efficient way to do it [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=280.96s)]
*  so you've got the president and and Apple really at loggerheads about the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=284.24s)]
*  strategy of of this really important American company. Yes an American company [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=289.36s)]
*  Jared the president specifically targeting a company almost feels like [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=294.36s)]
*  picking winners and losers in this economy is this the way it's supposed to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=300.44s)]
*  work in America? It's a really important point and no it's not the way it's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=305.24s)]
*  supposed to work and neither is the president supposed to stand up there [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=311.0s)]
*  and tell warm Walmart not to raise prices I mean this is the kind of thing [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=314.8s)]
*  you expect more out of authoritarians like Victor Orban than we've seen in our [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=318.48s)]
*  country so you know Trump has this kind of king-like approach to so much of what [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=323.8s)]
*  he's doing whether it's executive orders or using the bully pulpit or for that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=328.92s)]
*  matter matter essentially starting a trade war by himself but you know it's [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=333.16s)]
*  not really by himself he has so many enablers and I'm not just talking about [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=337.68s)]
*  his staff they're paid to enable him I'm talking about the Congress particularly [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  the congressional majority nobody is holding back what we all clearly see as [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=345.76s)]
*  irrational destructive policy and you know it's it takes decades to build up [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=351.44s)]
*  trade relations and literally weeks to tear them down and I'm seeing such a [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=356.96s)]
*  discouraging lack of resistance from people whose job it is to try to block [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=361.56s)]
*  stuff like this. There's talk of course we've heard some of his Republican allies [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=367.12s)]
*  say oh this isn't a good idea that's gonna hurt people in my district or in [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=372.6s)]
*  my state but the action is where we haven't seen much teeth. Thank you very [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=376.96s)]
*  much Jared Bernstein Christine Romans appreciate you both. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-j-tAgQOQ8&t=383.32s)]
