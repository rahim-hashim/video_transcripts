# 'Not a lot of diplomatic accomplishments': Breaking down Trump's trip to Middle East
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0)
*  Joining us now, PBS NewsHour co-anchor and MSNBC contributor Amna Nawaz and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=0.0s)]
*  President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations Richard Haass. He's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=5.76s)]
*  also the author of the weekly substack newsletter Home and Away. So, Amna, walk [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=9.9s)]
*  us through this trip and and what Donald Trump, the reception he got, but what he [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=15.88s)]
*  got out of it? Well, he got exactly the kind of reception you would expect from [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=21.56s)]
*  this region of the world and when we know that this president greatly [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=26.52s)]
*  appreciates. There's a lot of pomp. There's a lot of circumstance. There's a lot of red carpets and big sort of performances. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=29.4s)]
*  This is a big deal for the president to choose these nations as his first foreign trip [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=36.76s)]
*  abroad. And it sends a very strong signal about the way that he's viewing his role and how an emerging foreign policy could take shape here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=41.12s)]
*  I think it's important to point out that some of the biggest deliverables coming out of this trip have to do with business deals and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=49.64s)]
*  investment deals and some military deals, weapon sales and so on. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=56.2s)]
*  Not a lot of diplomatic accomplishments that you could walk away with from this trip, although the notable meeting with the new leader of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=60.6s)]
*  Syria is absolutely historic and shows us that it's taking a slightly different form when it comes to how the U.S. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=68.4s)]
*  is viewing the region. That's something that the Saudis have been pushing for for a very long time. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=74.0s)]
*  So you have the Saudi investments, Qatari investments in the U.S. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=78.88s)]
*  but also into Trump private businesses. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  And it tells us sort of it's really on brand for this president, right, that there's always a little bit of a conflict in terms of where the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=85.72s)]
*  professional and presidential official commitments and responsibilities line up and where the personal Trump family businesses also tend to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  benefit. So I think there's a lot of questions about what exactly will come in terms of how the U.S. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=103.0s)]
*  benefits from this. But the president is certainly hailing these as big accomplishments to walk away with. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  It's like he fits in well in the Middle East, much more so even last time, but much more so than last time. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  He's always been very transactional, but there there was a warmth to this reception, a camaraderie that I think was noticeable. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  The New York Times reports that Saudi Arabians in talking about Donald Trump saw them as saw him as one of their own. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=126.92s)]
*  He gets us, they would say. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=133.08s)]
*  Is is this the moment for the Middle East? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  Is this the president that that they've been waiting for? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=138.08s)]
*  Well, I obviously feel comfortable with the fact that he tends to commingle the personal and the professional where government ends and family [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=141.52s)]
*  begins is mixed like it is in the Middle East. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=147.88s)]
*  They are really happy with the idea that he gave a big speech. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  And what do you say? It's not the business of the United States to tell you how to run your countries. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=153.84s)]
*  We're not going to do that anymore. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=158.12s)]
*  We're not going to spread democracy. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=159.28s)]
*  The difference between him and George W. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=160.68s)]
*  Bush in 20 years is stunning. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=162.88s)]
*  The leap in American foreign policy. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=165.88s)]
*  He also likes big diplomatic things. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=168.0s)]
*  Two things. One was the meeting with the Syrian new leader. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=169.96s)]
*  And second of all, the Iran push. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=173.12s)]
*  Is that going to happen? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=175.68s)]
*  I think there's a decent chance the ground is set for it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=176.6s)]
*  The Iranian economy is big time hurting. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=179.28s)]
*  And second of all, the Israelis have demonstrated Iran's physical vulnerability to aerial attack. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=181.68s)]
*  So what the president is doing is offering them essentially a deal. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=187.32s)]
*  The most interesting question will be whether the president stands up to certain hawks in this country, if you want to use that expression to the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=191.84s)]
*  government of Israel and basically says, we're still going to allow Iran a little bit of nuclear enrichment, because if that's what that's what [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=197.72s)]
*  it's going to take to get the deal. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=204.84s)]
*  But I actually think there's a chance he will stand up to it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=206.12s)]
*  And the fact that he didn't go to Israel on this trip, that to me is so interesting. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=209.6s)]
*  So, you know, foreign policy is interesting not just for what you do, but you don't do. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=213.04s)]
*  And the fact that he avoided Israel shows a real independence. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=217.12s)]
*  What might he been what might have the Saudi leaders, the Emiratis, the Qatar leaders, the Qataris have said to him about Israel, about [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=219.72s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, about what they would want him to do with Netanyahu. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=229.88s)]
*  What sort of pressure they'd want him to put on him. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  They are wildly unhappy with Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=236.6s)]
*  Basically, Palestinian issues were nonexistent for the new generation. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=239.04s)]
*  And what Gaza's done over the last year and a half and the aftermath of October 7th, it's awakened a whole new generation of Arabs [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=243.72s)]
*  on the street, on the street and places like Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  So what they're basically saying is we would like to normalize with Israel, but we can't do it unless Bibi Netanyahu changes [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=253.76s)]
*  Israeli policy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=260.52s)]
*  One of the interesting questions will be down the road. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=261.68s)]
*  If the president wants an Israeli Saudi breakthrough, will he put pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=264.08s)]
*  I don't have the answer to that, but I think that's interesting. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=270.64s)]
*  My question is, what does that pressure look like and what does that mean for Gaza? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=272.32s)]
*  Is it Donald Trump putting pressure on Netanyahu to pull out? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=275.64s)]
*  And then what happens with Gaza? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=279.76s)]
*  Does he then put pressure on the Saudis or the Qataris or, I don't know, the Jordanians if they have the capability to go in and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=281.23999999999995s)]
*  govern? I mean, there's still a very big question mark over what to do next. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=289.11999999999995s)]
*  100 percent. But what he would basically say, you, Benjamin Netanyahu, would put forward your day after scenario. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=293.84s)]
*  That's called Israeli occupation, settlement, continued warfare. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=298.8s)]
*  That's not acceptable to us. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=303.2s)]
*  What we want to see is a day after that opens up a political process for Palestinians, creates a context in which Arab forces could [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=304.8s)]
*  maybe go in and they would be the occupying force with a large Palestinian component. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  Really a big question whether Donald Trump will push the Israelis in places they're not comfortable with. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=316.64s)]
*  You know, I said before he came into office, I think he has a real opportunity in the Middle East. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=321.76s)]
*  Are you seeing that? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=325.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=326.64s)]
*  All right. Richard Haas, I'm none of us. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=327.36s)]
*  Really good to see you guys. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=329.2s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDVZ4OddWY0&t=330.36s)]
