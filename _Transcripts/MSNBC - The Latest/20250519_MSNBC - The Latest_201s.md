# Bipartisan well-wishes pour in after Biden prostate cancer announcement
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY)
*  We're back now with our breaking news. Former President Biden has been diagnosed with what's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=0.0s)]
*  called an aggressive form of prostate cancer and well wishes are pouring in. Secretary [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=6.32s)]
*  of State Marco Rubio wrote on X, Jeanette and I are united in prayer for the Biden family [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  during this difficult time. And Senator Dick Durbin wrote, praying for my friend and former [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=17.12s)]
*  colleague Joe Biden. After hearing news of his diagnosis, Loretta and I will be keeping [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=22.92s)]
*  Joe, the entire Biden family and the medical professionals treating him in our thoughts [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=27.88s)]
*  during this time, continue to keep the faith, Joe. And really the support for Biden and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  his family. It's coming from all corners. Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeting recently, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=39.8s)]
*  I'm sending strength and prayers to President Biden and his family, even Congresswoman Marjorie [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Taylor Greene, actually. I'm sorry to see this news. She wrote cancer is truly awful. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=51.44s)]
*  She talks about her dad passing away in 2021 from cancer and offers prayers for Joe Biden [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=56.72s)]
*  and his family. So really seeing this incredibly divided body actually united in sensitivity [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=62.0s)]
*  and affection toward this family tonight, which in some ways I almost hate to bring [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=69.4s)]
*  this up, but it's a little bit of a relief because I feel like temperatures have been [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=74.16s)]
*  so hot in the political environment for so long. It's nice to see people who've very [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=77.92s)]
*  vehemently disagree, acknowledging the pain and suffering and hopefulness, I guess, of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=86.7s)]
*  this former president. And I think part of what this speaks to is that so many families [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=96.06s)]
*  have themselves dealt with cancer, either losing a loved one or having a loved one survive [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=101.58s)]
*  it. Yeah. And I think also cancer has played such a, I don't know if the right word is [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=107.14s)]
*  central, but a defining characteristic in this president's both policy and personal [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=112.3s)]
*  lives because of what he experienced as a father losing his son, but then also using [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=117.34s)]
*  that tragedy to put cancer at the forefront of his policy objectives with the cancer moonshot. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=122.3s)]
*  I think it raises a very important conversation about the broader aspects of our society. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=129.5s)]
*  When we look at a president, obviously a president with tremendous amount of power, it is sometimes [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=135.66s)]
*  so difficult to be able to say, I need to just strip this office and look at the human person. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=140.22s)]
*  And I think that's what we're seeing tonight. People are able to say, wait, we understand [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=146.62s)]
*  the presidency has a lot of power. People disagree with Joe Biden on a lot of policy issues. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=150.22s)]
*  They fundamentally think he's responsible for a lot of things, but ultimately when they see this [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=154.7s)]
*  moment of vulnerability for any human being, you can't but help see the humanity in this moment [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=159.1s)]
*  and recognize that and pay tribute with a little bit of empathy. So it is a nice moment, not [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=164.38s)]
*  for the obvious reason that the president has been diagnosed with cancer, but a nice moment [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=170.06s)]
*  that the country can just put this divide for a second and just pay tribute to the difficulty [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=173.5s)]
*  that he finds himself in. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbWij4HytY&t=199.58s)]
