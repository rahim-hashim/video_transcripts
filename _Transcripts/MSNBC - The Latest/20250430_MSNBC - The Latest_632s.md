# It’s official! Musk leaving as Trump thanks him amid crash for Tesla and markets
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY)
*  The plan to freeze government spending is on hold. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=0.0s)]
*  In port, Elon. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Nothing that is being done, nothing, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  is actually making life better for the American people. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=8.08s)]
*  Elon Musk has been a big part of the first 100 days [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=12.08s)]
*  across the 100 days, as you probably noticed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=14.44s)]
*  And now we have a special report on one [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=16.56s)]
*  of the most unprecedented parts of all this, the world's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=18.84s)]
*  richest man, reportedly now moving [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=22.28s)]
*  beyond daily government work. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=25.36s)]
*  That's the plan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  I'll explain that in a moment. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=27.84s)]
*  But he did join the cabinet meeting today [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=29.48s)]
*  in a little bit of a different posture. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=33.04s)]
*  If you think that body language matters, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=34.96s)]
*  and in Hollywood and Washington it certainly often does. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=36.96s)]
*  Back in February, he was very big, standing over, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=41.68s)]
*  almost lording over the meeting bravado. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=45.8s)]
*  Today, while definitely a presence, he was seated. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=47.6s)]
*  It seemed almost coordinated, as the president also [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=51.6s)]
*  made a point of praising Musk while hinting at his departure. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=54.36s)]
*  This whole room can say that very strongly. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=59.72s)]
*  Really been a tremendous help. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=62.04s)]
*  You opened up a lot of eyes as to what could be done. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=64.0s)]
*  And we just want to thank you very much. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=66.88s)]
*  And you're invited to stay as long as you want. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=68.6s)]
*  And at some point, he wants to get back home to his car. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=72.84s)]
*  And it's that kind of thing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=76.16s)]
*  This is not political rocket science. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  You can kind of see what's happening. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=81.92s)]
*  A special acknowledgment, the applause, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  alluding to going, but not being pushed out. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=88.72000000000001s)]
*  Stay as long as you want. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=90.64s)]
*  There's actually more to that under law, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=92.48s)]
*  which I'll explain in our report. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=94.48s)]
*  But we have evidence that Musk is planning [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  to get back to his day job, or other business day job, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  so to speak. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=101.4s)]
*  And we have evidence that is documented, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  because there are still rules, even [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  if you're pals with the president [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=106.76s)]
*  and a partial government employee. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=108.2s)]
*  There are rules through the SEC and shareholder [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  and regular updates about what the CEO is up to. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=112.2s)]
*  Musk has told Tesla shareholders he'll [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=116.04s)]
*  spend less time on the federal government stuff [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=117.64s)]
*  and more time running the company. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=119.76s)]
*  His personal fortune has crashed an astounding [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=121.44s)]
*  $114 billion in these hundred days. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=125.16s)]
*  That is a ton, even, for someone as rich as Musk, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=128.16s)]
*  over a billion a day lost. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=132.4s)]
*  And it is related. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=134.32s)]
*  Musk, of course, broke out his chainsaw. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=135.68s)]
*  And he got some things done in Washington, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=138.08s)]
*  trying to use what are basically quick fixes, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=141.8s)]
*  instead of the longer hard work of changing staffing plans [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=144.32s)]
*  for a multi-year budget with Congress. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=148.84s)]
*  He went in and tried to pick off or fire [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=150.92s)]
*  the people that were easiest to do under the current rules. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  His fortune, of course, is based on many things. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=156.6s)]
*  But the huge part is the only currently publicly traded [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  company he has, Tesla. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=162.4s)]
*  You can see the price dropping over a third. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=164.28s)]
*  And there are a range of reasons. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=168.04s)]
*  But even Tesla analysts and pro-market people [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=169.28s)]
*  who want Tesla to succeed have complained that partly it's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=172.48s)]
*  that Musk has politicized himself, his brand, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  and his companies, that regular Americans have taken [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=177.68s)]
*  the protests against Musk's government cuts [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=180.04s)]
*  and taken them out in the streets, in the fields, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=182.88s)]
*  into Tesla shops, calls for boycotts. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=184.88s)]
*  But it also goes beyond that company. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=189.72s)]
*  Americans have been clear that the idea [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=192.12s)]
*  that a part-time employee of the federal government, who also [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=195.72s)]
*  insists on running his other companies, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=199.28s)]
*  having this much power over our federal government [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=202.08s)]
*  and our staff and various programs, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=205.84s)]
*  that people don't think that's a good idea [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=208.4s)]
*  and that they are aware of the obvious conflicts of interests. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=210.76s)]
*  My concern right now, and I think [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=216.24s)]
*  I speak for a lot of Americans, is we want less. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=218.0s)]
*  The Musk Airways have been authorized [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  by the president of the United States. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=223.6s)]
*  Move on. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=227.6s)]
*  Move on. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=228.6s)]
*  Can we count on you to go back to Washington [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  and demand immediate oversight into Joe's and Amy's? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=232.48s)]
*  No. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=236.48s)]
*  No. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=237.48s)]
*  These are real people looking at this real situation [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=239.4s)]
*  with their response. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=242.24s)]
*  And we've covered before how some things in government [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  still work. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=247.24s)]
*  We've seen the Supreme Court continue to do its job [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=248.16s)]
*  and enforce limits. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=251.0s)]
*  We've seen some agencies enforce limits. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=251.88s)]
*  We've also seen the Trump folks push and get away with a lot. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=253.64s)]
*  But keep in mind, most members of the Trump administration [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=256.4s)]
*  and all of the cabinet, they are following the current rules. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=260.2s)]
*  They don't think they would get away with breaking the law [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=263.12s)]
*  on that and still trying to order around federal government [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=266.08s)]
*  employees. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=268.88s)]
*  If you insisted on running, say, the Treasury Department [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=269.84s)]
*  and Goldman Sachs and making money self-dealing, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=272.2s)]
*  we have every reason to think a court would say no. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  And then all the employees at that agency would say, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=278.2s)]
*  I'm not following your orders because the court just [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  said you're not in charge. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=283.0s)]
*  There are things that still work, is my point. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=284.56s)]
*  Musk has found a temporary loophole, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  where he doesn't have the same level of divestment, oversight, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=289.64s)]
*  or transparency because he's a part-time employee, what's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  called a special government employee. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  It's that loophole. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  So you don't actually have to go as far with the ethics [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=298.08s)]
*  requirements and financial disclosures, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  let alone divesting your whole company, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=301.96s)]
*  because the idea as flexibility was sometimes the government [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  might need a certain expertise from someone [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  who's not going to easily step away [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  from their whole job forever. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=312.64s)]
*  But there's a limit. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  130 days of government work a year. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=315.8s)]
*  Under law, that's the limit. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=318.91999999999996s)]
*  And there's evidence he's spent, and this is debatable, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=321.24s)]
*  but Fortune says about 90 days so far doing it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=323.44s)]
*  And he says he wants to keep working a day or two a week. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  He could stretch this out and kind of keep a relationship [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=329.52s)]
*  with the president. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=333.0s)]
*  But the larger point is, however much it seems sort of random, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=334.24s)]
*  and now they're having the meeting, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=338.52s)]
*  and hey, thanks a lot, they're heading [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=339.88s)]
*  towards a 130 day break. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=341.96s)]
*  And maybe they don't like admitting at the Trump White [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=343.2s)]
*  House that they're following the rules all the time, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=345.76s)]
*  so they're not citing that reason. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=347.4s)]
*  But it is interesting to see they're approaching that limit. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=348.96s)]
*  Remember, Musk could keep working after that limit [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=352.44s)]
*  if he just wanted to follow rules like everyone else, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=355.4s)]
*  do some disclosures, join the cabinet. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=358.35999999999996s)]
*  Only he can say, and only he might really [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=361.0s)]
*  know why he's so afraid or unwilling to do that, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=362.96s)]
*  if this public interest job was so important. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=366.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Republican speaker [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=368.76000000000005s)]
*  is blocking basic efforts that the Democrats have pushed [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  to deal more directly with this new situation [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=373.88000000000005s)]
*  of this sweeping government employee having [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=376.44000000000005s)]
*  so many conflicts. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=378.6s)]
*  We have seen as Elon Musk is on his exit out [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=382.32000000000005s)]
*  of the federal government, he has secured billions of dollars [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=386.04s)]
*  in new contracts across the federal government. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=389.12s)]
*  Conflict of interest? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=392.04s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  That's the Democrats using their bully pulpit to flag this. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=396.0s)]
*  They don't have enough votes to force the floor [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=400.16s)]
*  to take it up in the House, so we're reporting [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=402.44s)]
*  on how democracy works. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=404.52s)]
*  Republicans had a real but slim House majority, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=405.68s)]
*  and the Dems would need to convince some Republicans [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=409.0s)]
*  to join them to get that floor action I mentioned. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=411.64s)]
*  But this is still a big problem. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=414.8s)]
*  I've told you, there's sometimes in politics [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=416.36s)]
*  where we just get a denial that, no, no, it's no problem. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=417.84s)]
*  Musk and Trump understood it was a problem, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=421.28s)]
*  so they didn't deny that conflicts were an issue. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=424.2s)]
*  Instead, remember, they initially [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=426.8s)]
*  made a big show of claiming there would be no business [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=429.15999999999997s)]
*  conflicts, no requests for help. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=432.24s)]
*  It was a vow that they then very publicly broke. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=435.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I haven't asked the president for anything ever. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  And if it comes up, how will you handle it? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=443.52s)]
*  Well, he won't be involved. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=446.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'll recuse myself if it is. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=447.76s)]
*  If there's a conflict, he won't be involved. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=450.2s)]
*  I mean, I wouldn't want that, and he won't want it. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=452.12s)]
*  I love Tesla. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=454.6s)]
*  You got to give him credit. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=455.92s)]
*  We want the future to look like the future. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=457.6s)]
*  And it's kind of, what kind of truck would Blade Runner drive? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=459.6s)]
*  The one I like is that one. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=462.52s)]
*  And I want that same color. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  A fact check for both of them, false. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=467.68s)]
*  Musk did not recuse from the Tesla [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=470.88s)]
*  event on the White House lawn. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  Maybe the stock price pressure made [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=474.8s)]
*  him rethink the limits that he claimed so loudly on Fox News [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=476.64s)]
*  and television and elsewhere. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=479.8s)]
*  But they're literally hawking the company's product. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=481.0s)]
*  If you saw it in a movie, you'd say, that's a bit blatant. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=484.24s)]
*  Would they really do it like a showroom? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=486.48s)]
*  That is how Musk has been running roughshod over not [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=488.88s)]
*  only the spirit of the rules, but his own claims [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=491.56s)]
*  for himself. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=494.52s)]
*  His companies also have contracts [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=495.72s)]
*  with many different federal agencies. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=497.24s)]
*  And as I've told you before, some of his companies [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=498.8s)]
*  have done remarkable things. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=501.24s)]
*  They produce value. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=502.88s)]
*  They were under contracts before he [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=504.44s)]
*  had this relationship with the current administration. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=506.72s)]
*  So we want factually to report on this [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=509.0s)]
*  and make sure that you're not getting ripped off. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=511.24s)]
*  But we're not suggesting that he's never done anything [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=513.4s)]
*  of independent value. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=515.6s)]
*  The problem is now he wants it both ways. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=517.56s)]
*  And then also trying to slash the government [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=520.48s)]
*  and fire all these federal workers [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=522.64s)]
*  while doing business with the federal government. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=524.16s)]
*  The savings that he said he would produce, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=527.04s)]
*  the claims about them have also gone down. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=529.72s)]
*  I think we could do at least $2 trillion. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=533.8s)]
*  I think we will try for $2 trillion. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=535.76s)]
*  I think that's the best case outcome. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=539.8000000000001s)]
*  But I do think that you kind of have to have some overage. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=542.48s)]
*  I think if we try for $2 trillion, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=545.84s)]
*  we've got a good shot at getting one. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=547.24s)]
*  We can actually find $1 trillion in savings. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=548.88s)]
*  That would be roughly 15% of the $7 trillion budget. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm excited to announce that we anticipate savings in FY26 [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=556.32s)]
*  from reduction of waste and fraud by $150 billion. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=561.08s)]
*  Those were Musk's claims. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=565.84s)]
*  Now let's look at an independent audit. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=568.5600000000001s)]
*  That's what most companies rely on, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=572.0400000000001s)]
*  especially when they're looking outside at a merger [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=573.64s)]
*  or buying something. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=576.24s)]
*  The New York Times reports Musk's approach to government [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=577.08s)]
*  cost taxpayers over $130 billion. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=580.2800000000001s)]
*  In other words, the bulk of what Musk has done [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=586.6s)]
*  has wiped out the claimed savings, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=590.4399999999999s)]
*  even if you quote his current agency. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=593.84s)]
*  And you take that together, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=597.48s)]
*  and the numbers aren't really adding up. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  Not for the claimed savings for the federal government. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=601.56s)]
*  Definitely not for Mr. Musk's loss of over $100 billion. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=604.3199999999999s)]
*  What did we just live through? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwrUUh-YsY&t=608.72s)]
