# Intimidation and expansion: Historian on Trump’s military force amidst California protests
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE)
*  Joining us now, Julian Zelizer, professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=0.0s)]
*  and Kevin Barron, national security analyst and president of Elevation Global Strategies. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Gentlemen, welcome to the weekend. Julian, let me start with you and the question about, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  this is the thing that vexes me the most about what we're talking about with regard to Los [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Angeles. The defense secretary saying that if the violence doesn't subside, that he will deploy [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=23.28s)]
*  Marines on U.S. soil there in Los Angeles. Tell viewers why that would, historically, why that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=30.64s)]
*  has never happened and why that has never happened. Well, presidents are very reluctant to deploy [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=38.96s)]
*  this force. There is legislative constraints on their doing so, and either they have the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=45.2s)]
*  Insurrection Act, which does give presidents broad authority to use this kind of force, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=52.48s)]
*  but has been very reluctantly deployed, or with regards to the National Guard, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=57.36s)]
*  there is work with the governor of the state to bring in forces when needed. But what the secretary [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=62.96s)]
*  is announcing is a whole other level of intervention without it being requested that raises concerns [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=68.96s)]
*  about expansion of presidential power, once again, this time combined with the use of force that can [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=75.92s)]
*  be quite dangerous on the ground. And Kevin, let me just, on this same question, because you [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=81.92s)]
*  used to cover the Pentagon when you were a journalist, talk about, from the Pentagon's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=87.68s)]
*  perspective, the idea that this could happen, that the secretary of defense is thinking, has [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=93.44s)]
*  warned that he's going to deploy Marines on U.S. soil. Well, it's something that's on the books [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=101.04s)]
*  and is always possible, but as we're saying, it's so rare. I think, to me, none of this is unexpected. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=108.08s)]
*  None of this is surprising, right? We heard on the campaign trail, and we heard even in the last [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=114.16s)]
*  Trump administration, they were itching to send troops in to put down the George Floyd riots and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=118.4s)]
*  protests, and they've been itching for a reason. President Trump said he wanted to ask why he [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=123.44s)]
*  couldn't shoot the protests. That's right. They've been itching for a reason to do it. So, of course, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=127.2s)]
*  they don't need to do this. I've heard other commentators talking about how, you can see what's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=132.0s)]
*  happening in the streets. This does not look like something that you need to send in the troops for, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=135.68s)]
*  but it gives them the reason to do what they said they want to do, which intimidates any other city [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=139.36s)]
*  into thinking that it could happen there as well. It intimidates any other civic protest that might [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=144.4s)]
*  be trying to organize to help either block these police and ICE agents from coming in to do what [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=149.52s)]
*  they're being asked to do. So it's just set up something I've feared the entire time, which is [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  a violent clash between two different types of law enforcement or military forces in this country [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=160.24s)]
*  when one thinks that they're doing the right and legal job they're being ordered to do, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=165.44000000000003s)]
*  and the other is thinking the same. And here we go. You might see some sort of standoff on the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=170.0s)]
*  streets of LA. Julian, you are a historian. We are continuing to see the White House and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  administration officials use the word insurrection over and over and over again. They talk about this [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  invasion that's happening. It seems very tied to Title 10, which is the law they're leaning on, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=184.8s)]
*  to be able to send in the National Guard without the request from the governor of California. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=191.28s)]
*  As a historian, what is the significance of that? It doesn't feel like something they're just doing, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  randomly tweeting about it. It seems kind of coordinated. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  Well, the point of having that restraint is so that presidents don't do this very easily. We are [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  a country created with a notion that presidential power has to be limited. So limiting the president [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=212.88s)]
*  to cases of invasion is meant to be a check. For the president to keep using that term, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=220.8s)]
*  to keep bringing the public back to the concept we are being invaded, this is an insurrection, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=227.04s)]
*  is essentially creating the preconditions rhetorically for the president to then use force, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=233.36s)]
*  or we saw it with the power of deportation. So the words matter. The words are essentially [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=239.6s)]
*  the cover that the administration is using to undertake actions we have not seen from [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=246.32s)]
*  many presidents other than in cases of actual domestic turmoil, such as in the Civil War [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=252.72s)]
*  or even in 1992 in Los Angeles, or clashes over civil rights back in the 1950s and 60s. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=259.52s)]
*  This is a whole other level we're entering into, yet a new precedent being set. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=267.68s)]
*  Well, and on that note, our colleague, Jacob Soboroff, interviewed the border czar Tom Homan [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=272.64s)]
*  yesterday. And let's hear what Tom Homan had to say about the California governor and Los Angeles [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=279.12s)]
*  mayor. Saying that about Mayor Bass and Governor Newsom, are they at risk of being arrested? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=285.92s)]
*  I'll say about anybody, you cross that line. It's a felony to knowingly harbor and conceal [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  an illegal alien. It's a felony to impede law enforcement from doing their job. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  That's pretty strong language directed towards elected officials. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=305.12s)]
*  And we've seen bits and pieces of this. We saw this with the judge in Wisconsin. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  We're seeing more clashes between the executive branch and other officials, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=314.32s)]
*  not intellectual or policy clashes, but literal threats of arrest or other kinds of measures. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=319.84s)]
*  So these are all different kinds of acts of intimidation and expansion. And I think Americans [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=327.44s)]
*  need to be cognizant. Again, federalism, separation of power, limits on executives are all foundational [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=333.76s)]
*  to our country, and they are being tested in every single one of these cases. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=341.76s)]
*  I'm Kevin. I want to squeeze in a real quick question to you, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=346.24s)]
*  because a moment ago, as Julian was answering a previous question, you mouthed to me, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  immunity. Talk about it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=354.96s)]
*  This is what I've been thinking about since yesterday. Look, we can talk about what the, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=356.56s)]
*  and it's good to talk about what the laws were meant to prevent or how to slow down. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  He has immunity. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=363.76s)]
*  So from the Supreme Court's decision. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=364.88s)]
*  You know, he does. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  For official act. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  And using troops in some way that is possibly against the law or he's not supposed to, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=368.4s)]
*  or is out of decorum. Who cares? He has immunity. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=374.16s)]
*  Well, that's it. Julian and Kevin are sticking with. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i52rXujAQnE&t=377.84000000000003s)]
