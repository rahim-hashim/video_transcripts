# President Trump is launching new attacks on the judicial system after judges blocked his agenda
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg)
*  President Trump is launching new attacks on the judicial system and going after judges who have issued dozens of orders blocking his agenda [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=0.0s)]
*  If you look at the founders the president had certain powers and you have your three groups and they all had [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=8.92s)]
*  supposed to be equal pretty equal powers [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=15.48s)]
*  But you can't have a judge in Boston [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  running foreign policy and places all over the country because [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=21.8s)]
*  He's got a liberal bent or he's a radical left person [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=26.36s)]
*  That's what the executive branch is for [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  The president also lashed out at an unlikely target [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=34.2s)]
*  conservative legal activist [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=38.44s)]
*  Leonardo, leo the former chair of the Federalist Society was a trump confidant who helped shape his first term judicial picks [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=39.96s)]
*  Trump wrote on truth social Friday [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=48.0s)]
*  They were under the thumb of a real sleazebag [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=50.24s)]
*  Named leonard leo a bad person. I am so disappointed in the Federalist Society because of the bad advice [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=53.48s)]
*  They gave me on numerous judicial nominations back with us is James sample. Thanks for sticking around [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  So what's going on here with this about face? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=67.48s)]
*  It is a remarkable thing to see Donald Trump go after Leonard Leo [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=70.8s)]
*  You know if you think about the Trump administration [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  Going forward if you think about the legacy in advance the most enduring legacy of Donald Trump and this and his two [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  administrations is going to be a [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=86.04s)]
*  product of Leonard Leo and Mitch McConnell which is to say it is going to be the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=88.2s)]
*  Supreme Court of the United States and the rightward turn that it has already taken and the lower federal courts that have already moved [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=92.68s)]
*  Significantly and will surely continue to move significantly [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=99.44s)]
*  You know they had a little bit of a falling out post 2020 to start with but Leonard Leo has long been the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=102.44s)]
*  Establishment figure in Washington DC when it comes to judicial nominations and judicial politics the notion that Trump is [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  Distancing himself from the Federalist Society is a populist play for sure it is an anti-establishment [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=117.4s)]
*  Anti-elitist play, but it is also a play that distances him from one of the most effective [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  Allies an ally that frankly many on the left [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=132.44s)]
*  Resent because he's been so successful Leonard Leo has been a force it may not be a name known to the average American [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=135.72s)]
*  He's been a force of nature in reshaping the judiciary. He's a powerful powerful player [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  I suspect that this is Donald Trump playing the mean card before he eventually brings him back into the fold [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  Well Trump has been calling the Federalist Society picks whom Trump then nominated for the bench [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=156.16s)]
*  things like [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  Radical liberal judges and what you know they're all Marxists things like that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=164.44s)]
*  It seems like what Trump wants is just judges who will agree with him loyal to him loyal to him and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=169.2s)]
*  How effect I mean how possible is it for him to put those judges in place? He still has the opportunity [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=176.88s)]
*  Obviously to appoint new to our to nominate new judges would Congress go along with that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=183.8s)]
*  I suspect this Congress this Senate for now probably will go along with that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=189.16s)]
*  You know [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=193.32s)]
*  He's also cut the ABA out of the process just this week the way I think about this in terms [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  You know Donald Trump is on an extraordinary losing streak in the courts right now [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=198.36s)]
*  The courts are the thing that is up is holding up democracy in a good way [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  But if you think about this, I don't know if anyone at the table is a baseball fan the Chicago White Sox lost [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=207.52s)]
*  121 games last year ask yourself this question does anybody here think it was because the umpires went [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=213.16s)]
*  Rogue it was because they were a really really bad baseball team Donald Trump keeps losing in court [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=219.12s)]
*  Why because he's really bad at the law and isn't even particularly [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=225.36s)]
*  Interested in complying with the law and is firing all of the lawyers who advise him about what the law absolutely [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=230.08s)]
*  Stephen Miller can talk about a judicial coup the reality is if you exceed your authority time and again [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=236.6s)]
*  This is an individual the volume of executive orders and the scope of those executive orders [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=242.8s)]
*  He's not just trying to get around Congress and circumvent the the bicameralism and presentment process [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=248.2s)]
*  He's trying to amend the Constitution. He's trying to change the 14th Amendment's birthright citizenship provision via [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=254.28s)]
*  Executive order so if you overreach and you overreach and you overreach and you start losing in the courts a lot [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=260.84s)]
*  The courts start to look like the enemy [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=266.44s)]
*  It might be a better idea to look in the mirror you brought up Stephen Miller [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=269.32s)]
*  And I just want to play you this song by really quickly from Stephen Miller on CNN on Friday. Take a listen [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=272.76s)]

*  Democracy cannot function in fact democracy does not exist at all if each action the president takes foreign policy [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  Diplomatic military national security has to be individually approved by 700 district court judges [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=293.2s)]
*  That's democracy [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=299.76s)]
*  So if there's 15 communist crazy judges on the court [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  That each of them as a team working together can block and freeze each and every executive action [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=304.86s)]
*  Your your reaction to those comments. They're threatening right? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=310.9s)]
*  It's almost it's very ominous as to what this administration wants to do to the judiciary [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=313.82s)]
*  They want a purity test. They certainly don't mind when judges affirm their positions [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=319.74s)]
*  They just don't like the ones that disagree with them. It's purely results oriented. Amen. You phrased that extraordinarily [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=324.54s)]
*  Well, you know Steve Benin has a piece on MSNBC calm [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=330.94s)]
*  From just this week reflecting that argument reflecting on that argument [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=334.53999999999996s)]
*  He says the argument reflects a childlike logic Trump won a Democratic election [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=338.53999999999996s)]
*  Everyone here can concede that so today the president's will is to defy democracy [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=344.34s)]
*  Yes, the president does represent a significant [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=350.34s)]
*  Democratic process a significant democratic victory. Absolutely [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=354.5s)]
*  The judges in the United States of America are not not only are they not elected which is by design at the federal level [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=358.9s)]
*  They are responsible to stand up to for a different constituency [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=365.7s)]
*  Even if it's an unpopular constituency at times which is to say standing up for the Constitution [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=369.48s)]
*  Standing up for the rule of law that is actually the system that we set up [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=375.78s)]
*  You [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv6BfY3Mmxg&t=387.94s)]
