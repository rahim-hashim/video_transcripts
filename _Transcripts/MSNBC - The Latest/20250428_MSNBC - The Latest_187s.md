# ‘Just the beginning’: Trump tariffs force online retailers to raise prices
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8)
*  If you shop on popular online sites known for their low prices, get ready. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=0.0s)]
*  Your next order could be costing you more, with President Trump's tariffs forcing retail [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=5.42s)]
*  giants like Amazon, Shien and Tmoo to hike up some of their prices. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=9.58s)]
*  Joining us now is NBC's Christine Romans. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=14.02s)]
*  Christine, so how high should we expect things to go? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=16.42s)]
*  Well, let's remember, Shien and Tmoo, these are two brands that made a name for themselves [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=20.18s)]
*  by being able to ship directly Chinese goods to U.S. households dirt, dirt cheap, really [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=25.3s)]
*  cheap. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=32.02s)]
*  And so now you're seeing Shien raising prices and Tmoo putting the import tax right into [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=33.02s)]
*  your cart. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=38.34s)]
*  So for example, we have this example of a men's three-pack of athletic shorts, something [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=39.620000000000005s)]
*  like $26, but then the $35 import tax is added, so it's $56 for the same pair of shorts. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=45.08s)]
*  Now, a couple of things happening here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=52.74s)]
*  You've got that big tariff against China, 145 percent tariff on those goods. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=54.14s)]
*  But you also have this administration closed a loophole that allowed these low-dollar goods [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=59.7s)]
*  to be shipped directly to U.S. households. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=66.78s)]
*  So now that loophole has been closed, so these things cost a lot more. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=69.5s)]
*  But I've been telling you, I've been looking at some of these things. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=72.06s)]
*  Even with the extra surcharges and the taxes and the higher prices, they're still cheaper [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=75.66s)]
*  than most of the domestic-made alternatives as well. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=80.7s)]
*  So it's super interesting just how cheap these things were from Tmoo and Shien. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  Even with adding in these higher costs for consumers, they're still cheaper than their [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=90.58s)]
*  domestic equivalent. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=94.9s)]
*  But there you can see the Shien price increases there and the Tmoo price increases. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=95.9s)]
*  And some of the third-party sellers on Amazon, we've been watching them, they've been raising [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=100.84s)]
*  because the goods that they're buying are now going to cost more, Jose. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=107.1s)]
*  And Christine, this being the Chinese regime that is in charge of and responsible for anything [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=111.17999999999999s)]
*  and everything that comes out of China, they have a lot more, I guess, flexibility on how [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=117.3s)]
*  they deal with this. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=122.8s)]
*  Yeah, and both of these companies have been very, very adamant that they are not Chinese [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=124.3s)]
*  companies. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=130.82s)]
*  One is based in Singapore, one ships from Hong Kong. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=131.82s)]
*  Both of these statements are almost identical that they put out, and they are blaming recent [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=134.1s)]
*  changes in global trade rules and tariffs. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=138.34s)]
*  So watch this space. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=141.9s)]
*  This is just the beginning, though, because you're going to see other prices begin to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=143.45999999999998s)]
*  rise in the days and weeks ahead. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=146.26s)]
*  And we should be also watching for shortages, potentially, of toys and footwear and things [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=148.1s)]
*  that we can see in the container traffic that some of the containers of these things just [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=153.34s)]
*  aren't being shipped anymore. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=158.34s)]
*  Christine Romans, I thank you very much, and it's good that you're keeping an eye on all [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=160.06s)]
*  of this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=163.74s)]
*  It's probably changing by the minute. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=164.74s)]
*  Appreciate it, my friend. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXvUmleuU8&t=165.74s)]
