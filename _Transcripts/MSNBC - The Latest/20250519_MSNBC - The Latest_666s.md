# Biden prostate cancer diagnosis draws bipartisan well-wishing
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8)
*  More breaking news. Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with what's called an aggressive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=0.0s)]
*  form of prostate cancer. Sources tell NBC News and his family, he and his family are meeting with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=5.12s)]
*  doctors and considering multiple treatment options, including hormone treatment for the cancer. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=10.8s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor and Peter Baker, Chief White [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=16.48s)]
*  House correspondent for The New York Times. It's been a couple of hours since this news broke. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=20.16s)]
*  Yamiche, I'll start with you in terms of what you're hearing. We continue to hear an outpouring [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  of sympathy and support from all walks of or all political corners of Washington, D.C. But what [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=28.24s)]
*  more can you tell us about the reaction that's pouring in this hour? Well, this is, of course, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=34.56s)]
*  devastating news. And as you said, we've been hearing from a number of elected officials [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  who know Joe Biden well, given the fact that he's had decades and decades in politics. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=43.36s)]
*  I should first start with President Trump, who said that he and First Lady Melania Trump are [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  sending their well wishes. I read part of his statement. He said, I'm saddened he and the First [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=53.44s)]
*  Lady are saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=57.84s)]
*  and best wishes to Joe and the family. We wish Joe a fast and successful recovery. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=62.24s)]
*  We're also just in the last few seconds here, hearing from former President Barack Obama. Of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=67.84s)]
*  course, Joe Biden was his vice president. He wrote, Michelle, of course, referring to former [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=73.12s)]
*  First Lady Michelle Obama, Michelle and I are thinking of the entire Biden family. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=78.56s)]
*  No one has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all of its forms than [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=82.72s)]
*  Joe. And I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=87.12s)]
*  We pray for fast and full recovery. And I want to pause there to say, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  and he's talking about all that he's done, former President Biden, to talk about cancer [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=95.28s)]
*  and to fight cancer. It's because, of course, he dealt with tragedy in his own life. Not only [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=99.84s)]
*  did he lose, sadly, his first wife and his daughter in a car accident, but then later in life, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=103.76s)]
*  he lost his oldest son, Bo Biden, just at the age of 46 to brain cancer. So he has been someone [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=109.04s)]
*  who's been vocal about cancer and needing to try to find a cure for it. I also want to read to you [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=114.64s)]
*  a statement that's coming from the UK prime minister, because, of course, we're getting [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=120.16s)]
*  global reactions tonight. The UK prime minister writing, in part, too many men are struck by this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=122.8s)]
*  disease. We must continue to raise awareness of the danger it poses. Wishing Joe all the best for [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=127.92s)]
*  his treatment. We've also heard from others like the current secretary of state, Marco Rubio, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=133.12s)]
*  who, of course, is a Republican, as well as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=137.28s)]
*  both of them also saying that they are wishing former President Biden a speedy recovery. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=140.56s)]
*  It really is showing you that despite the politics and the real contention between Democrats and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=144.88s)]
*  Republicans, tonight what you're hearing on both sides of the political aisle are people that are [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=149.52s)]
*  really, in some ways, reaching out to Joe Biden and saying that they wish him the best. So, of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=154.08s)]
*  course, President Trump, he's had a contentious relationship with former President Biden. We're [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=158.96s)]
*  going to see if his tone changes at all. We also know that this news comes, of course, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=162.88s)]
*  a couple of other challenges for President Biden, including a new book that's coming out [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  that's going to challenge his cognitive abilities when he was serving in the last few years in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=172.0s)]
*  office. So a lot that Joe Biden is dealing with tonight, but people closely tell me tonight that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=175.84s)]
*  he is ready for this fight and that he is going to be looking for treatments across the board. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  All right, Yamiche Alcindor, thank you for that. Let me ask you, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  Peter, really quickly on some of the issues that we've been hearing about with the timing of this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  Somebody who has covered the White House pretty extensively, there's been questions about how [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=196.72s)]
*  frequently the president gets tested medically, whether or not this could have been something that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=199.76s)]
*  could have been detected on his way out or maybe perhaps during his final couple of months of his [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  presidency. Have you had a chance to ask any officials or any ex-officials that you've been [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  speaking to about whether or not you know when the president was last checked before this announcement [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  on Friday or this test on Friday? Sorry, Peter, I think you're... [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=220.16s)]
*  Sorry, I was muted. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=227.28s)]
*  No worries, go ahead. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=228.8s)]
*  Yeah, there are questions being asked about that. The family and their representatives [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=230.88s)]
*  insist that he was only diagnosed on Friday, but we do know that in recent weeks he has been to the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=234.72s)]
*  hospital there in Philadelphia. We don't have any history, a timeline yet of how far back any tests [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  might have gone that might have detected this earlier, but they do insist that they did not [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=248.32s)]
*  actually have a diagnosis until Friday. There'll be presumably more information about the timeline. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=252.16s)]
*  How far back this goes, this has never been mentioned in his previous medical reports when [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=257.92s)]
*  he was president. The doctor who examined him didn't mention, for instance, a high PSA or [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=262.48s)]
*  any kind of indications that this would be coming on, but he's 82 years old, obviously, and it's... [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=268.08s)]
*  This is the kind of risk factor as you age that comes with that. He's overcome health issues in [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  the past. He had annuaries as a young man in the 1980s, and the family is insisting that he will [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=282.88s)]
*  overcome this as well. Peter, so as you have noted, Biden is no stranger to tragedy, to health crises, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=288.08s)]
*  including many members of his family and himself dealing with cancer diagnoses in the past. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  It has been an important part of his agenda, the cancer moonshot. How do you think he is personally [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  absorbing this news, this diagnosis, given the role it has played in his family's life in the past? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Joe Biden's identity, both personal and political, has been one of overcoming hardship. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=318.0s)]
*  Yamiche mentioned the tragedy way back in 1970 when he first got elected to the Senate and the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=324.0s)]
*  auto accident that killed his wife and young daughter. Time and time again, he has [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=328.8s)]
*  confronted setbacks and tragedies in his own life, the aneurysms we talked about being two failed [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=334.32s)]
*  presidential campaigns before the one that was finally successful, the death of his son, Bo. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=341.68s)]
*  His identity is overcoming those. He talks about this in one of his memoirs, getting [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  over-stuttering as a young man. His father taught him, get back up. Every time you're knocked down, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=354.16s)]
*  get back up. And that has been central to his attitude toward life. It may have, in fact, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=358.72s)]
*  been one of the contributing factors in his decision to run again, even when other people [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=364.72s)]
*  thought maybe it would be a graceful time for him to retire after one term. He resisted that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=368.32000000000005s)]
*  because he wants to believe that he can always come back from any adversity. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=373.92s)]
*  So I think he's looking at this tonight without knowing, obviously, I haven't spoken to him. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  But I think you can imagine, given his history, he's looking at this adversity tonight as one more [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=380.72s)]
*  test in the lifetime of them. Peter, we were speaking with Andrea Mitchell in the last hour, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=384.96s)]
*  and she was describing a bit about what the former president and his family have been going through [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=390.79999999999995s)]
*  in the last several weeks and months. Obviously, a really challenging time for him, and even in [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  just the last few days, the news cycle at times incredibly harsh. And she was sort of reflecting [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=402.88s)]
*  on what it would mean for the family to take some time together this weekend to support him. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=408.96s)]
*  What kinds of conversations do you think are happening among the family members in the inner [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=414.96s)]
*  circle right now as they move to support him through this incredibly difficult moment? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=419.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it does come at a fraught moment, obviously, for former President Biden. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=426.88s)]
*  No moment is good for this kind of a diagnosis, obviously. But the last few days, as you really [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=430.88s)]
*  point out, the news cycle has been geared up toward renewed questions about his decision to run [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=435.12s)]
*  for a second term, given the issues of his age, given the signs of decline, physical and otherwise. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=442.08s)]
*  And that's being revived by this book that will come out on Tuesday by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=448.56s)]
*  It will be revised by the release of that audio tape of his interview with the special counsel, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=453.84s)]
*  Robert Herr, where his voice sounds hard to distinguish. He seems confused at moments. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  And so this will remind people—this could have a couple different ways of looking at it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=464.64s)]
*  Obviously, it will remind people that having a president of a certain age [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=470.0s)]
*  entails these kinds of risks. Had he been president right now and come down with this diagnosis, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=474.32s)]
*  it would be a national crisis and not just a personal crisis for his family. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=478.32s)]
*  On the other hand, I think it will remind people of things that they like about President Biden. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=483.04s)]
*  He is somebody who, even though his approval ratings were low at the end, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=487.6s)]
*  has the respect of a lot of people in the United States, even those who don't support him, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=491.04s)]
*  respect his half century of public service, the devotion he has given to his country, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=494.88s)]
*  his essential, innate decency and his obvious love of family. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=501.6s)]
*  So I think that in a time of personal crisis like this, it kind of brings back home [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=507.04s)]
*  a lot of these memories for people who have seen him on their TV screens for most of their lives. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=513.36s)]
*  It's important to note, Peter, that he was actually, even since leaving office, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=521.12s)]
*  pretty active still. I mean, he was just in New York, did an interview on The View. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=524.16s)]
*  He was somebody who had not kind of gone off into the sunset and still weighed in on a lot [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=527.92s)]
*  of the conversations that are taking place in this country. And that speaks volumes for the role [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=532.4s)]
*  that he still occupies within Democratic politics and certainly the leadership of [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  the Democratic Party. How might that—how might this diagnosis affect that standing [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=541.6s)]
*  and affect his role in that leadership? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=546.96s)]
*  Well, it's an interesting thing. It's a good question, because a lot of Democrats, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=548.96s)]
*  frankly, have been pretty upset at President Biden for a while. They blame him for insisting [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=553.2s)]
*  on running when it probably wasn't the best idea and that they think that his decision to stay in [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=558.56s)]
*  so late, only getting out 107 days before the election, left the party in a damaged position. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=565.12s)]
*  So a lot of Democrats have been pretty bitter toward him lately. So this may [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=571.68s)]
*  this may encourage some of them to say, yeah, well, we were right about questions about his [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdwVXcc0FV8&t=577.6s)]
