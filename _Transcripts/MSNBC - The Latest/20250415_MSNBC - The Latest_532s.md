# 'They can't hide the ball': Judge cracks the whip on Trump lawyers in deportation case
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM)
*  Exactly one month ago, the Trump administration abducted and imprisoned a Maryland man named [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=0.0s)]
*  Kilmar Abrego-Garcia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=5.96s)]
*  They flew him and hundreds of other men to a prison in El Salvador. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=7.8s)]
*  The government has since called imprisoning Mr. Abrego-Garcia, at least, a mistake. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=11.16s)]
*  Five days ago, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous 9-0 decision, ordered the Trump administration [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=16.52s)]
*  that they needed to bring him back. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=21.88s)]
*  They needed to, quote, facilitate Mr. Abrego-Garcia's return to the U.S. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=23.92s)]
*  Well, they haven't done so yet. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  And today in court, a federal judge in Maryland just excoriated Trump administration lawyers [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=30.72s)]
*  over the administration's refusal to comply with that order, the administration's refusal [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=36.4s)]
*  to go get Mr. Abrego-Garcia, or at least prove that they're trying to. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=41.56s)]
*  The judge, quote, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Just so everyone knows where my current thinking is, Mr. Abrego-Garcia has already won his [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  injunctive relief. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=53.16s)]
*  It was affirmed not only by the Fourth Circuit, but by the Supreme Court. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=54.6s)]
*  We're here today to talk about the scope of the remedy, which means that while expeditiousness [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=58.04s)]
*  is of the utmost importance, because it is a fact now of this record that every day Mr. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia is detained in the prison in El Salvador, that is a day of further irreparable [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=69.12s)]
*  harm. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=74.64s)]
*  At the same time, if not this court, then who to engage in process? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=75.64s)]
*  It's process that is in the roots of our Constitution. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=80.72s)]
*  So we have to give process to both sides, but we're going to move. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=83.88s)]
*  There will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=86.56s)]
*  We will talk about the contours of this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=89.44s)]
*  But that's where I am right now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=92.0s)]
*  At one point, the Trump administration lawyer argued about the meaning of the word facilitate, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=93.92s)]
*  calling it a term of art within immigration law. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=99.72s)]
*  The judge said in response, quote, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=102.69999999999999s)]
*  I'm not even sure what you mean. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=104.8s)]
*  But as a factual matter, I do need evidence in this regard, because to date what the record [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=106.56s)]
*  shows is that nothing has been done. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=111.12s)]
*  I've asked for daily reports daily by individuals with personal knowledge, and I've gotten [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=113.72s)]
*  very little information of any value. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=118.36s)]
*  Trump administration lawyer, your honor, I think what we have submitted reflects that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=121.28s)]
*  there have been significant steps. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=124.8s)]
*  In particular, we cited to this issue was raised at the highest possible level. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=126.83999999999999s)]
*  We cited to this issue was raised at the highest possible levels yesterday. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  It was raised in the Oval Office between two heads of state, between the President of the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=135.28s)]
*  United States and the President of El Salvador. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  The issue was specifically discussed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=141.62s)]
*  The judge, a reporter, asked a question. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=143.94s)]
*  The defendants have never responded to the question, what steps have you taken? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=146.82s)]
*  The plaintiff is asking, why don't the defendants just ask? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=150.9s)]
*  You will release him? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=153.54s)]
*  We've got no, I've got no answer on that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=154.54s)]
*  And in response to this notion that what happened in the Oval Office is satisfactory, that's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=157.70000000000002s)]
*  not before the court. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=161.86s)]
*  I mean, you include a transcript. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=163.02s)]
*  I don't know what this transcript is supposed to be assisting me in. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=164.5s)]
*  But the bottom line is, it was a very simple directive. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=168.70000000000002s)]
*  My question that the court, the high court, squarely affirmed, I can ask, what have you [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=171.58s)]
*  done? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=175.66s)]
*  I've gotten nothing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=176.66s)]
*  I've gotten no real response, nor have I gotten any legitimate legal justification [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=177.66s)]
*  for not answering the question. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=181.06s)]
*  That's why we need to move to the next step. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=182.94s)]
*  Because in fairness, if you're not going to answer the questions that the plaintiff's [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=185.22s)]
*  put within the scope of my order, then you will justify why. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=188.18s)]
*  You will cite privilege, you'll follow the rules, I will make a determination. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=191.86s)]
*  That is what we do in this house. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=196.14s)]
*  That is the most fair I can be. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=198.3s)]
*  She said, and I don't consider what happened yesterday, meaning in the Oval Office, as [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=201.54s)]
*  really evidence before this court. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=205.54s)]
*  Lawyers for Mr. Obrego-Garcia then asked the judge to hold the Trump administration in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=209.73999999999998s)]
*  contempt of court over their failure to comply with the court's orders. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=213.38s)]
*  The judge did not rule out finding them in contempt. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=218.01999999999998s)]
*  She said first she wants to make the Trump administration submit evidence and sit for [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=220.5s)]
*  depositions and quickly. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=223.85999999999999s)]
*  Trump administration's lawyer voiced his concerns about scheduling those depositions [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  He said, quote, Your Honor, I don't know right now their availability. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=231.02s)]
*  I assume that can be arranged in a seven day period, but I can't say that conclusively. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=234.54000000000002s)]
*  Upon the judge said this, well, cancel vacation, cancel other appointments. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=239.74s)]
*  I'm usually pretty good about things like that in my courtroom, but not this time. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=244.66000000000003s)]
*  So I expect all hands on deck. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=248.06s)]
*  It won't be a convenience issue. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=250.38000000000002s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=252.22000000000003s)]
*  I will be flexible if you need to accommodate depositions, you know, whether it's in the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=253.22000000000003s)]
*  courthouse because you have the court available to call balls and strikes as the depositions [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=256.86s)]
*  go on. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=260.66s)]
*  I'm going to be available if you need to do it at odd hours or weekends. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=261.66s)]
*  I'm also available. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=264.54s)]
*  Trump administration lawyer, we will move expeditiously, Your Honor. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  Judge. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=270.66s)]
*  OK, I appreciate that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=271.66s)]
*  After today's hearing that Maryland judge put in writing her order requiring the Trump [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  administration to turn over evidence of its efforts to facilitate Mr. Obrego-Garcia's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=278.58000000000004s)]
*  return home. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=284.14s)]
*  The judge spelled out an expedited schedule. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  She is instructing Obrego-Garcia's lawyers to submit their requests for evidence by tomorrow [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=287.41999999999996s)]
*  evening. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=291.58s)]
*  Those requests can pertain to, quote, the current physical location and custodial status [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=293.24s)]
*  of Obrego-Garcia. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  What steps, if any, defendants have taken to facilitate his immediate return to the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=299.47999999999996s)]
*  U.S. and what additional steps the Trump administration will take and when to facilitate his return. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=303.34s)]
*  The Trump administration missed reply to those requests no later than 5 p.m. on Monday. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=310.02s)]
*  Mr. Obrego-Garcia's lawyers may also depose at least four members of the Trump administration [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=315.62s)]
*  on this matter by next Wednesday. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=320.9s)]
*  Joining us now is Rena Gandhi. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  She's a partner at Maria Soria Immigration Law Firm. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=325.29999999999995s)]
*  She's one of the attorneys representing Mr. Obrego-Garcia in this matter. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=327.85999999999996s)]
*  Ms. Gandhi, I really appreciate you being here tonight. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=330.94s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=333.21999999999997s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  So we got this transcript right before the show started tonight, and we have been sort [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=336.98s)]
*  of going through it and pulling from it as we can. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=342.5s)]
*  Let me ask you, if I missed any important details or mischaracterized anything of what [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=345.58000000000004s)]
*  happened at today's hearing? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  No, I think that is a very good summary. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=351.38s)]
*  Those are the highlights that I certainly took away. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=354.78000000000003s)]
*  No, I think that was accurate. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=358.02000000000004s)]
*  What do you expect to happen next over the course of this next week in terms of what [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=360.90000000000003s)]
*  is now a court-ordered but not yet manifest order to have your client come home? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=365.3s)]
*  Well, I do believe that we will be able to get some answers from these very people who [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=375.3s)]
*  wrote these affidavits, providing us not very much before. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=382.82s)]
*  I think when confronted with very specific questions where they can't just file a report [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=387.06s)]
*  saying we're not required to say anything, we'll hopefully return results. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=392.62s)]
*  They can't hide the ball here anymore. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=400.62s)]
*  And this hearing today really helped us move forward, move towards bringing Mr. Arrego [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=404.14000000000004s)]
*  Garcia back home. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=409.82000000000005s)]
*  Are we now in a situation—and I'm not a lawyer, I'm just observing these things [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=412.82000000000005s)]
*  as a lay observer here—but with the Trump administration and the president himself asserting [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=416.54s)]
*  that it is not within the power of the U.S. government to bring your client home, that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=422.54s)]
*  it's up to El Salvador, because they operate the prison where the U.S. is paying to hold him? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=426.3s)]
*  Is that assertion from the president and from the Trump administration essentially wholly [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpkP7iPDXM&t=432.78s)]
