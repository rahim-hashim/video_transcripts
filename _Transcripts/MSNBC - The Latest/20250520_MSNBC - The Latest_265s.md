# ‘Ignorant and unacceptable’: Symone Sanders Townsend on Noem’s habeas corpus snafu
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA)
*  Kristi Noem, the nation's Homeland Security Secretary, she had trouble answering really [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=0.0s)]
*  basic questions about a fundamental right guaranteed in our Constitution. Take a listen. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  What is habeas corpus? Well habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=12.8s)]
*  to be able to remove people from this country and suspend their right to... [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=19.68s)]
*  Let me stop you ma'am. Habeas corpus, excuse me, that's incorrect. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=23.52s)]
*  Do you know what section of the Constitution the suspension clause of habeas corpus is in? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=27.28s)]
*  I do not. No. Do you know which article it is in? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  No, I do not sir. Meritocracy. Government or the holding of power by people selected on the basis [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=35.68s)]
*  of their ability. Meritocracy is a society governed by merit. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  Habeas corpus, you have the body. It is the government taking someone and imprisoning them [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=50.72s)]
*  without due process and that's what it prevents. That's what it's there for. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=57.04s)]
*  Yes, it allows people to challenge their detention. It allows to challenge their detention [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=60.8s)]
*  to make sure that the government is justified in taking people and the fact that the Homeland [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Security Secretary had no clue what it was as she's snatching bodies. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=72.0s)]
*  Almost thought it was the opposite. Thought it was the... [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=78.4s)]
*  This is the... Habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=81.11999999999999s)]
*  That sounded like a rehearsed answer. You know, when you go into the hearings, obviously, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=88.16s)]
*  you've all... There's prep that the principals do. So someone either told her that or that's what [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  she truly believes. Either way, it is ignorant and unacceptable. It feeds the beast behind the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=97.28s)]
*  resolute desk. That's what that line is. The constitutional right that the president has. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=103.52s)]
*  Where, Kristi Noem, in the constitution does the president have more power than the people? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=110.08s)]
*  Come on. Why are you in the job? Merit. It's a meritocracy. Remember? To qualify, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  people get the job. You did clarify that moment, Damian. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  She's a meritocracy. That's why I read it at the top. Apparently, the qualification to be the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=126.4s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary under this Trump administration is to be able to put on the outfits [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=130.08s)]
*  and the outfits, they're very cute, by the way. They're very cute, yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=135.36s)]
*  She has an outfit for everything. It's just like me when I go skiing, honey. Outfit for everything, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=137.76000000000002s)]
*  not getting on the slope. Okay, and to be able to look nice when you sit in front of Congress, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=141.52s)]
*  but zero substance. Earlier today, Tom Homan referred to the conduct of Representative [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=146.56s)]
*  LaMonica McIver as unprofessional. You know what was unprofessional? Kristi Noem, anytime she goes [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=151.84s)]
*  before Congress. I thought it was interesting, the question, and it could have gotten lost. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=155.84s)]
*  The Senator, Andy Kim, asked about the suspension clause. It focuses on the power of Congress. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=160.08s)]
*  Shall not be suspended unless we're in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=166.72s)]
*  require it. That is the argument that Stephen Miller and Donald Trump have been laying this entire [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=173.68s)]
*  time. They've convinced a certain subset of the American electorate that there is in fact [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  an invasion underway. It's the same way they're using Alien Enemies Act to make the... This is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=184.72s)]
*  the argument they're saying. They're saying we are under threat. That's it. Do they get to have it [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=190.8s)]
*  both ways? Well, yeah, well, because they do. And I love the way you did that because you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=194.0s)]
*  crystallized what this whole thing has been energized by. This idea that anything and anyone [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=199.76s)]
*  that stands in opposition to their actions, that is the rebellion. Looking past the actual rebellion [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=206.24s)]
*  on January 6th, because you pardon all those folks who actually rebelled. You've got a woman [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=213.76s)]
*  who's now a member of Congress who's standing in for judges and the law right now because [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=221.12s)]
*  she didn't rebel. She did her job. And that is in opposition to what Trump and his administration [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=228.08s)]
*  is about. That's why they're coming after her as rebellion. You know what? There you go. Michael [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=234.96s)]
*  still said it all, folks. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiewa1TpHA&t=243.36s)]
