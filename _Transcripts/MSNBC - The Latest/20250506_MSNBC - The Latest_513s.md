# 'Incredibly tone-deaf': Why Trump's doll comments are out of touch with working Americans
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8)
*  Two grown daughters, I have three small granddaughters. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=0.0s)]
*  And look, keeping dolls affordable, keeping our kids' toys affordable, that really is [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=3.6s)]
*  part of the American dream. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=11.28s)]
*  I think the American people are going to see the consequences of this. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=12.64s)]
*  I think they'll demand a different approach. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=16.0s)]
*  And I think that approach is free trade with free nations. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=19.36s)]
*  Let's use the leverage, the threat of tariffs, to negotiate down trade barriers with free [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=22.52s)]
*  nations, even while we stand firm with China and others. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=28.36s)]
*  And joining us now, former Democratic congressman from New York and senior adviser at VOTE Fest, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=31.72s)]
*  Max Rose, MSNBC political analyst and former press secretary, to former House Speaker John [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=35.72s)]
*  Boehner, Brendan Buck, and still with us, Matthew Dowd. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=40.24s)]
*  Brendan, I know that we're kind of jaded at this point, but it is still surprising to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=43.44s)]
*  see a former vice president continue to criticize his former boss. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=50.2s)]
*  Yeah, obviously there's no love lost there anymore. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=57.080000000000005s)]
*  Mike Pence has been freed up to speak what is honestly should not be surprising politics, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean, or policy views. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=66.68s)]
*  What Mike Pence is talking about was what defined conservatism and the Republican Party [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=69.72s)]
*  for literally decades. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=74.4s)]
*  Look, it's one of the reasons I'm a Republican. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=75.4s)]
*  I believe in free trade. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=78.44s)]
*  Donald Trump's right that other nations have put up trade barriers higher than we do. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=80.28s)]
*  But as a result, we have benefited more than anyone. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  Our commitment to free trade has made us the envy of the world. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=88.4s)]
*  We have the best economy the world has ever known. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=91.48s)]
*  And so Mike Pence is talking about tried and true principles for economic growth. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=94.68s)]
*  That shouldn't be surprising. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=99.92s)]
*  But Donald Trump has so changed what we stand for as a party, it makes him a lonely voice, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=101.68s)]
*  but it really shouldn't be. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=107.38000000000001s)]
*  And I think we're going to learn pretty quickly why this is a bad idea. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=108.38000000000001s)]
*  And Donald Trump's going to pay, I think, a pretty big political price for it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  I agree with Mike Pence on that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=114.36s)]
*  Let me play Scott Bessent at the Economic Club back in March. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=115.8s)]
*  Access to cheap goods is not the asset, is not the essence of the American dream. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=122.44s)]
*  The American dream is rooted in the concept that any citizen can achieve prosperity, upward [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=128.76s)]
*  mobility and economic security. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=134.8s)]
*  I feel like if you change the cadence, put a little bit more energy into that speech, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=137.96s)]
*  you could have heard AOC say this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=143.52s)]
*  Matthew, what's going on with the Republicans? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm sure Brendan completely understands. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=149.24s)]
*  They are untethered to their traditional economic policy that they, you know, Reagan, Bush, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  all the Eisenhower, whomever you name, was tethered to in the course of this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I, you know, the Dow thing, in combination with so many other things, to me, I mean, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=166.24s)]
*  I'll take a little different, slightly different stance, though I agree with Mike Pence on [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=171.52s)]
*  this, is so tone deaf, is so completely, utterly tone deaf with what working Americans are [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=175.12s)]
*  experiencing in their lives today. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=181.68s)]
*  They're not walking around thinking, oh, I can't afford 30 dolls. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=183.72s)]
*  Maybe they buy one doll for their kid's birthday or Christmas in the course of this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=187.88s)]
*  And having had a daughter, I know what that is, having bought her an American Girl doll [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  years ago in the course of this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=195.56s)]
*  They're worried about paying their electricity bills and affording air conditioning. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=197.72s)]
*  They're worried about, you know, having towels in their house. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=201.88s)]
*  They're worried about the price of groceries in this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=206.9s)]
*  And so, yeah, gifts and all of that are well important. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=210.52s)]
*  But the idea of saying, well, they can only, you know, they're not going to be able to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  pay 30 dolls, which I don't know, maybe Donald Trump and the others live in households that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=216.0s)]
*  I'm unaware of where people are running around buying 30 dolls. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=221.44s)]
*  I think it's incredibly tone deaf at a time when Americans, especially working class Americans, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=225.6s)]
*  are experiencing such incredible hardship. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=231.4s)]
*  Let me read a little bit from The New Yorker because I think this encapsulates the just [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  the weirdness of Donald Trump saying this. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=240.16s)]
*  Trump made his fortune selling luxury apartments that explicitly cater to the notion that you [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=242.44s)]
*  can never have enough of anything, especially gold plating. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=246.72s)]
*  His crypto policies seem to be designed to further enrich himself and his family. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=250.64s)]
*  And his energy policies are a recipe for increasing carbon emissions. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=255.4s)]
*  Making personal sacrifices short term or otherwise is foreign to Trump's nature. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=259.64s)]
*  And yet for political reasons, he has been driven to ask Americans to accept some limits [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=265.36s)]
*  on their shopaholic tendencies. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=271.36s)]
*  You know, Max, you live in Staten Island. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  A lot of Trump voters there. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=275.56s)]
*  Lonely thing being a Democrat in that red of an area. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=277.76s)]
*  Did you see a lot of that aspirational quality to Donald Trump was really appealing in 2016? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you see this as being something that eats into the aspirations? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  Look, this is economic chaos and destruction, and that's never a good politics. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=293.32s)]
*  I don't care if you're Donald Trump or a Democrat. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=298.8s)]
*  But I'll tell you what shouldn't happen in light of Mike Pence's comments. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=302.2s)]
*  And we're all elated to hear he's pro doll. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=306.88s)]
*  The Democrats can't be the party of Mike Pence, just like we made a horrific mistake [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=309.64s)]
*  campaigning with the Cheney family. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  This is not an opportunity for them to become unabashed free traders or to say we are the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=318.04s)]
*  Republicans of the Bush Cheney era. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=322.8s)]
*  The principal issue with what Donald Trump and his MAGA extremists are doing right now is [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=325.72s)]
*  it is just incompetence writ large and it's destroying the economy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  So that's a really interesting point. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=335.8s)]
*  Right. This idea that we do have too much junk in this country. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=337.56s)]
*  Should Democrats run away from it or should they embrace the idea that maybe we do want to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=343.32s)]
*  have higher quality goods, more ability to to live our lives with less junk and more, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=348.2s)]
*  I don't know, more comfort. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=357.24s)]
*  We already had that debate as a country. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=358.91999999999996s)]
*  That's why we don't support child labor. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=360.4s)]
*  And that's why we have a minimum wage. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=363.4s)]
*  We already believe that there should be standards across the board and just having access [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=365.24s)]
*  to cheap goods is not the only thing that we are pursuing. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=370.84s)]
*  That's not what Donald Trump is doing right now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=374.96s)]
*  Without any notice whatsoever, he issued across the board skyrocketing tariffs that are [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=377.32s)]
*  destroying businesses throughout the United States of America. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  And he did it just because he wanted to issue some really cool tweets and excite his [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=387.12s)]
*  MAGA base. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=391.96s)]
*  So what is the argument for Democrats then? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=392.32s)]
*  How do they what is their economic lane here as they go after Donald Trump? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=393.8s)]
*  Is it just that he's unleashing chaos or is there something more? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=399.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, that's not a bad place to start. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=402.08s)]
*  But the Democrats should be and always should be in the place of enlarging and strengthening [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  the middle class. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=411.56s)]
*  And I'm sorry, when it comes down to it, tariffs is not how you're going to accomplish [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=412.96s)]
*  that. You're going to accomplish that by investing here at home. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=417.71999999999997s)]
*  You're going to accomplish that by raising the minimum wage. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  You're going to accomplish that by lowering health care costs that used to be old school [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=422.68s)]
*  Democratic policies. How about doubling the number of union members in the United States [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=426.88s)]
*  of America? I'll tell you how you're not going to do it, though, by becoming Mike Pence [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=430.2s)]
*  and saying, hey, we just want free trade across the board. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=434.8s)]
*  The guy also hates unions and wants the minimum wage eliminated. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=437.40000000000003s)]
*  We should not be celebrating Mike Pence. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=441.0s)]
*  Brandon, what do you think of that? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=443.04s)]
*  Well, Max is really reading on my parade because I thought one of the silver linings of [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=445.4s)]
*  this were Democrats were going to become free traders with us. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=448.84000000000003s)]
*  I guess. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=453.56s)]
*  My name is NBC. I'm the only Democrat here besides maybe the host. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=456.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=459.64s)]
*  Yeah, no, look, I mean, I understand that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  Look, what I would say is we I don't even think that cheap goods are part of the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=465.0s)]
*  American dream. I don't even agree that that is. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BDyrwP5H8&t=469.76s)]
