# Trump admin being sued by whistleblower attorney for revoking security clearance
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo)
*  The Trump administration is facing a new lawsuit this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=0.0s)]
*  Longtime national security lawyer Mark Zaid, who represented a whistleblower during President [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=4.0s)]
*  Trump's first impeachment trial, is suing the administration for revoking his security [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=8.56s)]
*  clearance. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=13.76s)]
*  Zaid's clearance was removed, along with other prominent officials, as part of a March executive [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=14.76s)]
*  order. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=19.68s)]
*  And Mark Zaid is joining us now, along with his personal attorney, Margaret Donovan. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=20.68s)]
*  Thank you both for being here. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Mark, for those of us who may not understand how security clearances work for lawyers, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=26.32s)]
*  how much has this impacted you and the work you do? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=31.28s)]
*  Fairly significantly. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=35.88s)]
*  I mean, a lot of my clients are covert spies for the United States government, folks who [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=36.88s)]
*  work at the CIA and elsewhere within the intelligence community, and I cannot represent them for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=42.2s)]
*  the most part now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=48.16s)]
*  I work a lot on anomalous health incident cases, what people know as Havana syndrome. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=49.92s)]
*  I don't like the term, but that'll explain it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=55.48s)]
*  And I use my security clearance to represent many of those people, especially for whistleblowers. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=58.4s)]
*  So it is a key facet in what's going on. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=64.4s)]
*  I don't even look at it as harming me as much as it harms federal employees and workers [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=68.96s)]
*  who I represent. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=74.08s)]
*  So Margaret, what is the argument you're making on behalf of Mark in this case? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=75.64s)]
*  And have you heard anything from the Trump administration so far? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=79.68s)]
*  Sure, Anna. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=82.92s)]
*  So the security clearance adjudication process, that's been developed over the past several [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=84.72s)]
*  decades in response to other presidents' executive orders, Supreme Court case law, and other [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=89.32s)]
*  case law. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=94.32s)]
*  And so the Trump administration has basically ignored all of that and just summarily revoked [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=95.48s)]
*  Mr. Zaid's clearance. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=99.24s)]
*  And so our lawsuit is basically asking a court to declare the March 22nd memorandum unconstitutional, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=100.8s)]
*  to declare it unconstitutional as to Mr. Zaid, and to rescind the revocation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=106.66s)]
*  And to answer your question, no, we haven't heard anything back from the Trump administration [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  yet. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=114.36s)]
*  And Mark, as you've discussed, you're not the only one who's had your security clearance [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=115.36s)]
*  revoked. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  The president also did the same for his predecessor, former President Biden, as well as Hillary [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  Clinton, just to name a couple. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=123.76s)]
*  But what is the danger in this being used as a political punishment? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=126.12s)]
*  Well, that's a real austere list. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=130.32s)]
*  And I am honored, I suppose, you know, to be along presidents and vice presidents and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=133.78s)]
*  attorney generals, et cetera. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=138.32s)]
*  I'm not one of them, right? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=140.36s)]
*  I'm not political. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=142.04s)]
*  I have never been an elected official in the U.S. government. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  I've never been an appointed official. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=147.12s)]
*  I'm a registered independent for my entire life, whereas everyone else there is political. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=148.88s)]
*  So what this action has been is strictly a political, vindictive action against those [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=155.48s)]
*  who are perceived or actually serving as adversaries against this administration. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  I've been holding administrations accountable since the Clinton administration over 30 years. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=168.56s)]
*  I do nothing differently from one administration, Republican or Democrat, to the next. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=174.28s)]
*  The difference is this administration can't take that, apparently. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=180.04s)]
*  So you believe you have been targeted because of being a perceived adversary. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=184.72s)]
*  Well, President Trump was asked about that by our Kristen Welker about dissent and criticism. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=189.6s)]
*  Listen to his response. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=197.84s)]
*  Do you see dissent as an essential part of democracy? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=199.4s)]
*  It's a part of democracy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=205.4s)]
*  It is. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=206.4s)]
*  You're always going to have dissent. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=207.4s)]
*  Is it an important part of democracy? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=208.4s)]
*  You're always going to have dissent. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=209.4s)]
*  You're always going to have dissent. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=210.4s)]
*  There's nothing you're going to do about that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=211.4s)]
*  Do you think people should have the right to criticize you without fear of reprisal? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=219.88000000000002s)]
*  That I do. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=220.88000000000002s)]
*  Mark your reaction to that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, Trump the Butcher is not speaking the truth. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=224.84s)]
*  And I say Trump the Butcher because Dick the Butcher was a character in Shakespeare's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=228.0s)]
*  Henry VI who said, let's kill all the lawyers, because the lawyers get in the way of authoritarianism. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=232.16s)]
*  And that's exactly what's going on here. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=239.32s)]
*  He talks about essential. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=242.04s)]
*  It's not essential. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=244.8s)]
*  Dissents fine as long as it's not against him and his administration. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=245.8s)]
*  So he already says when he talks about, for example, ending the Ukraine-Russian war, he [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=251.08s)]
*  just said it in jest. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=259.48s)]
*  So you can't believe anything he says. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=260.76s)]
*  Actions speak louder than words. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=263.68s)]
*  And if dissent was allowed, I would still have my security clearance, as I have had [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=266.16s)]
*  for 25 years. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=271.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=272.0s)]
*  And so with this suit, what is the end goal here, Margaret? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=273.0s)]
*  You know, Anna, the end goal is that we preserve our adversarial system of government and the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=277.2s)]
*  legal system generally. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  So as Mark said, this not only targets Mark, this targets federal employees who would have [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  turned to Mark. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=287.36s)]
*  It's also having the effect of chilling other lawyers from representing government employees. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=288.64s)]
*  And that's something that we simply can't tolerate. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=293.32s)]
*  And we hope the court will agree. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=295.08s)]
*  Mark, are you concerned that should you win, the Trump administration will just ignore [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=296.08s)]
*  the ruling? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=301.28s)]
*  I think that I've said that on this network that, you know, I think we are on the verge [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  of a true constitutional crisis when the Trump administration refuses a court order. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=307.76s)]
*  We've already seen indications of that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=315.36s)]
*  We'll see what happens once a Supreme Court ruling is ignored. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=317.32s)]
*  But I do think that is a real concern, just as we saw in President Jackson, Andrew Jackson, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=321.16s)]
*  way back in the 1830s administration. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=327.6s)]
*  And there's a reason why President Trump has a portrait of Andrew Jackson hanging in [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=330.88s)]
*  the Oval Office. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=335.28s)]
*  Mark Zaid, thank you so much for sharing your perspective, for joining us to talk more about [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=336.68s)]
*  your lawsuit. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=343.04s)]
*  Margaret Donovan, thank you for being with us as well. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjfV1E1Izqo&t=344.04s)]
