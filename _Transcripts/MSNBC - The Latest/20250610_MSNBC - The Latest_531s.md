# ‘People are freaked out’: Oversight Cmte. Dem on DOGE’s access to data
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4)
*  The federal judge has temporarily blocked Doge's access to data from the Office of Personnel Management. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=0.0s)]
*  In her ruling, New York Judge Denise Coates said that the plaintiffs, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=6.16s)]
*  led by the American Federation of Government Employees, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=9.68s)]
*  proved that Doge disclosed records, quote, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=12.72s)]
*  to individuals who had no legal right of access to those records. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=15.68s)]
*  In doing so, the defendants violated the Privacy Act [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=20.32s)]
*  and departed from cybersecurity standards that they are obligated to follow. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=23.76s)]
*  This was a breach of law and of trust. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=28.72s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Melanie Stansberry of New Mexico. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=31.76s)]
*  She is a member of the Oversight Committee and the Doge Subcommittee. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  Congressman, just very quickly off the top, what's your reaction to this decision by the court? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=38.32s)]
*  Well, I'll just say the courts are doing their jobs right now, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=44.32s)]
*  and thank God for the courts, because obviously we've never seen such lawlessness, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=46.96s)]
*  at least in my lifetime. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=51.92s)]
*  You know, I think it's very obvious, and when I'm traveling in my district, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=54.16s)]
*  it's the number one thing that everybody brings up to me, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=57.36s)]
*  regardless of their ideological background or political affiliation. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=60.16s)]
*  People are freaked out that these people are stealing their data. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=64.08s)]
*  And I think many of us were very shocked about the Friday decision [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=67.52s)]
*  by the Supreme Court in the Social Security case. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=71.2s)]
*  So I'm glad to hear that this district court judge ruled in this case [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=74.32s)]
*  on behalf of the American people. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=78.48s)]
*  But the reality is that this dude stole our data, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=79.92s)]
*  and we don't know what he's doing with it, but clearly it's illegal. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=83.2s)]
*  He's... This man stole the data. We don't know what he's doing with it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=86.64s)]
*  We do know that there were servers that were installed on the White House grounds early on, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=90.48s)]
*  that Give Us Five Things You Did This Week email was originating from Doge individuals. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=95.92s)]
*  And now we've learned that Musk's Doge team ignored White House experts, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=101.6s)]
*  warning the Starlink is a security risk. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  Sources told the Washington Post that those managing the systems [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=108.96s)]
*  weren't able to monitor such connections to stop sensitive information [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=111.92s)]
*  from leaving the complex or hackers breaking in. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=115.6s)]
*  This is notable because Starlink has been installed on the White House campus. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=118.08s)]
*  They said it was to protect, to boost some of the dead areas in the White House. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you've been to the White House. I've worked in the White House. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=128.88s)]
*  It's my recollection that many of the dead areas, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=131.68s)]
*  with the dead spots where you don't get good cell service... [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  Or created by security. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  ... are a variation to many of the skiffs that are on the White House complex. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=141.6s)]
*  Maybe it's just me. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=141.84s)]
*  One of the things you have to understand, you've worked in the White House. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  I used to work at the Office of Management and Budget. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=146.96s)]
*  And there are still legacy systems inside the White House. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=149.36s)]
*  There is still hard wire from the Pentagon to the White House. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  And there's a reason why that hard wire is there. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=155.84s)]
*  It's so that nobody can intercept it, right? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=158.16s)]
*  And so the idea that we would be transmitting sensitive, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=160.72s)]
*  highly secured American data, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=164.4s)]
*  dealing with national security over satellite transmissions, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=167.12s)]
*  is a national security risk. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=170.96s)]
*  And also, that's all privately controlled by his technology. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=172.48s)]
*  So what's to say that even Musk himself is not downloading that data, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=175.76s)]
*  more or less the opportunity for our foreign adversaries to intercept it? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=179.92s)]
*  So when we talk about data, I think that can feel really abstract. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  So let's take a look at some of what we're talking about. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  We talk about data that could be accessed through the Social Security Administration. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  Talking about driver's licenses, banking credit cards, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=193.12s)]
*  birth and marriage certificates, pension information, home and work addresses, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=196.16s)]
*  school records, immigration and naturalization records, family court records. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=200.16s)]
*  You can see it all there. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=203.6s)]
*  I mean, talk to me about the ways that could potentially be weaponized [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=204.96s)]
*  against the American people. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think one of the things that people are most freaked out about right now [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  is the reports that are coming out of the White House [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=212.8s)]
*  that they've been contracting with private AI companies like Palantir, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=214.96s)]
*  which is reportedly building a master database or integration system [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  to take American data from all of these different systems. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  And when you couple that with language that was in the big abomination of the bill [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=229.04s)]
*  that basically would tell states and local governments, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  you can't stop a private company from downloading data for AI systems. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  We're talking about not only the largest data breach ever in American history, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=241.6s)]
*  we're talking about the potential private AI companies [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=245.84s)]
*  to access your private and personal data off government systems. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=248.88s)]
*  And potentially, if this reconciliation language passes, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  like data that private companies have even in states and local governments [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=256.24s)]
*  or private businesses that secure that data, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=261.68s)]
*  we don't know how that could be used. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=264.64s)]
*  We know that Palantir, for example, develops biometric tracking systems [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  that's used by the military. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=270.8s)]
*  All of these things pose significant concerns and risks, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=272.88s)]
*  especially given what we're seeing today on the ground in LA. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=276.4s)]
*  It's the data, it's the data, it's the data. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=280.0s)]
*  It's always the data. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=282.0s)]
*  Can I say people think that the government already warehouses their data though, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=282.72s)]
*  and they don't. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=286.56s)]
*  There's not one place that the government has everyone's data. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=287.68s)]
*  A lot of that comes out of conspiracy conversation [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  from going back to Nixon, right, and all of that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  And we understand that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  But I think at this point, it's real. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  It's much more real. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=303.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=304.8s)]
*  Because with the physical manifestation of it in Doge, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=305.04s)]
*  I thought it was a little bit ironic and a whole hell of a lot funny [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=308.8s)]
*  that the Wall Street Journal is reporting that Doge staffers [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=313.6s)]
*  feared getting fired or getting Doged, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=317.92s)]
*  noting Doge workers embedded throughout the federal bureaucracy [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  still fear a blowback. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=325.04s)]
*  Text groups lit up as the clash escalated last Thursday. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  That was the whole bro breakup between Trump and Musk [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=330.24s)]
*  with some Doge affiliate staff texting one another [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  about whether they would be fired. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=337.76s)]
*  Nothing sweeter could happen than they're being fired. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=342.24s)]
*  But that tells you a lot about how cynical and— [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=346.88s)]
*  there's a word I want that I probably can't use, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=355.36s)]
*  so I'm not going to use it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  Messed up this is that they understand enough to know [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=359.84s)]
*  when the tables turn, and they could be fired. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=364.64s)]
*  Given what they've done over the last five months [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=368.4s)]
*  to federal workers across the system. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=370.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's very obvious. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  Last week, I took to the House floor, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=377.76s)]
*  and I read the tweet breakup into the Congressional record. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=379.2s)]
*  You know, it was fun. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=383.52s)]
*  It was funny. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=384.24s)]
*  But the main point was we wanted it to be on record. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=384.8s)]
*  And since then, Elon Musk has already started deleting tweets [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  that he was tweeting during his breakup. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=391.28s)]
*  And the reality is that we know they've been breaking the law. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=394.0s)]
*  There's over 200 court cases against them. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=397.12s)]
*  But we also—there's things that we don't know. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=400.24s)]
*  What did Elon Musk actually do to support Donald Trump's election [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=403.92s)]
*  besides donating $300 million? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  Was there a use of data to be able to do that? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=410.8s)]
*  Peel it back. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=413.6s)]
*  I mean, we don't know what these Dogers are doing inside the government, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=415.68s)]
*  and we don't know how Donald Trump got there. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=419.2s)]
*  And so I think we're all eager for the law and the courts [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=422.24s)]
*  to reveal what actually has been going on. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=426.0s)]
*  Before we let you go, I want to make sure that we do talk about the images [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=428.0s)]
*  that we're watching on our screen. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=431.12s)]
*  And one of the ways I think it ties the conversation [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=432.72s)]
*  that we're having about Elon Musk and Donald Trump is— [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=434.64s)]
*  Donald Trump is not acting in isolation. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=436.48s)]
*  And I think as it relates to the use of national guards, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=438.96s)]
*  it's interesting to think about the role of Pete Hegsath [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=442.16s)]
*  and what we learned during Pete Hegsath's confirmation hearings, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=444.88s)]
*  specifically that he has promoted— [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=448.0s)]
*  rather, that he railed against military lawyers, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=452.0s)]
*  promoted what he saw as unduly restrictive rules of engagement [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=453.92s)]
*  aimed at protecting civilians in war zones, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=457.36s)]
*  fired the top judge, advocate, general lawyers, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=460.32s)]
*  who give advice on legal constraints. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=462.88s)]
*  What concerns do you have with a secretary of defense, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=465.6s)]
*  with that POV who is now acting at the behest of a president [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=469.44s)]
*  who believes he has statutory authority he doesn't have? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=472.72s)]
*  Well, what concerns don't I have about Pete Hegsath? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=475.6s)]
*  I mean, this is the most unqualified DOD secretary [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=478.88s)]
*  this country has ever seen, period, hands down. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=481.84s)]
*  And, you know, my partner is a Marine veteran. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=484.56s)]
*  And so to see the deployment of Marines from Camp Pendleton, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=487.28s)]
*  I find it to be a gross and disgusting abuse of power. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  There is no legal basis for it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=497.28s)]
*  It is an abuse of presidential power. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=499.35999999999996s)]
*  And to deploy troops that are preparing for national security missions [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=502.4s)]
*  to be deployed against American citizens is disgusting. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTslj_l5sD4&t=507.44s)]
