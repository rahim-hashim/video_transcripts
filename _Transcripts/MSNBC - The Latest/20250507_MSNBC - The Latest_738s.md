# Trump stumbles in culture war with museum: DuVernay on how to read Trump’s EOs
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ)
*  Political conservatives have long complained about Hollywood and American pop culture. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Go back to the 90s, you had Republicans arguing that sitcoms like Murphy Brown were undercutting [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=4.96s)]
*  traditional family values or the role of fathers because of a fictional portrayal of a single [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=10.88s)]
*  parent as a choice. These days, we have other complaining that's been rebooted for Disney or [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=16.64s)]
*  even M&M's. Conservatives saying that there's an alleged kind of wokeness that liberal agendas are [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=22.96s)]
*  being woven into what sometimes seem like random topics, even candy. Now you have mega conservatives [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=28.16s)]
*  who want to actually use federal power to control culture more and sometimes even history itself. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=36.64s)]
*  Now, Republicans now have a party that's organized itself around a leader who came from inside [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=44.0s)]
*  entertainment. Trump was best known as a reality TV host, eager for any movie cameos and TV show [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=50.24s)]
*  cameos like you see right there. This unbridled second term Trump is going after culture, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=56.32s)]
*  trying to reshape the leadership of the Kennedy Center. That itself has drawn protests from [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=63.28s)]
*  artists and past honorees, trying to defund PBS by alleging that it has bias. That was in a new [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=69.28s)]
*  order this week, which follows a tax on funding for the arts at the National Endowment. And then [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=75.68s)]
*  there's America's iconic Smithsonian. That's the Washington building there, a huge tourist attraction. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=81.92s)]
*  It's a nonpartisan bastion of American learning. It's now been targeted in a Trump order that claims [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=87.84s)]
*  to combat materials that the Trump administration deems to be improper ideology. Now, this is not [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  just one more thing about scoring political points. I'm going to show you the evidence of why this [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=103.68s)]
*  actually is important, because it looks like a wider effort to corrupt and shape history itself [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=108.48s)]
*  and what's in Americans minds. Again, by the government, the Trump order talks about its view [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=115.76s)]
*  of truth and sanity for American history. And then it gets specific. So let me show you what they say. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  Then you can use your mind to make up your mind. They critique a Smithsonian exhibit about race [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=130.16s)]
*  in American sculpture as, quote, divisive because it portrays American values as inherently [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=135.92s)]
*  harmful, critiquing the exhibit for stating, quote, the U.S. has used race to establish and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=142.32s)]
*  maintain systems of power and disenfranchisement. Okay. It's a historical fact that U.S. systems [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=149.04s)]
*  from slavery to Jim Crow to voter suppression have maintained racial systems of power and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=159.68s)]
*  disenfranchisement. That's what happened. That's the history. We're talking about museums where you [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=165.76s)]
*  have historical artifacts. And that's the example that Trump folks came up with. That's what they [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  want to rebut. It's very telling. The Smithsonian work, of course, it goes on. They're curating [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=176.24s)]
*  exhibits for what are sometimes millions of visitors a year. And they're honoring cultural [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=183.84s)]
*  icons with the great Americans medal. Tomorrow, director and filmmaker and writer Ava DuVernay [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=188.8s)]
*  will be honored there as well. It is unacceptable that they use their power and keep us voiceless. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=195.36s)]
*  We are in search of warriors. So difficult. Talked about mass incarceration because it has been [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=203.84s)]
*  heavily monetized. Warriors who serve the good and the light of the universe. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=209.52s)]
*  That's some of her work. And when you look at this clash over history at the Smithsonian, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  we reach for a wise political observer and writer, George Orwell, who famously warned, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=220.0s)]
*  who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  I'll leave that up for a second because what he meant was by controlling our understanding [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=234.96s)]
*  of history, you can control politics of the future. And of course, if you have power today, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=239.6s)]
*  you might control that past. We've all heard the term Orwellian and what's happening at the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=245.12s)]
*  Smithsonian because I took a look at the administration's arguments, as we always do [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  to see if they have merit, to see what examples they had. But their example was that accurate [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  history about racial oppression itself, they say, should be removed. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=261.84s)]
*  Yes. I actually take great solace in actually reading these executive orders because their [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=267.84s)]
*  level of absurdity actually calms me. It reminds me that we're being gaslit. It reminds me about [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=275.84s)]
*  the chaos that is being stirred through the very language to say that there's a restoration of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=286.23999999999995s)]
*  truth and sanity. And then when you actually read that order, it's laughable. And to do that helps [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=291.44s)]
*  me kind of cut through the emotion of it because I'm an artist, I'm an emotional person, to really [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=298.24s)]
*  kind of pierce through that and look for what's real within it. And what's real in these documents [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=305.6s)]
*  is history. It comes to life in the executive orders because within the executive orders, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=311.12s)]
*  we are reminded of that same language in the past and how that turned out. And so by actually [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=315.36s)]
*  reading it myself, not just getting a synopsis or a summary on the news, I felt fortified in the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=322.72s)]
*  fact that what we're hearing is nonsense and really trying to create some steps forward for [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=329.36s)]
*  myself as an artist and the people around me. I like that. I like what you're kind of reminding [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=334.32s)]
*  us, which is it can be upsetting or befuddling, but sometimes just actually taking it in and saying, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=338.72s)]
*  that's how thin the argument is and there's still a world out here of people who care about facts, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=345.36s)]
*  history and the arts. Which brings us to you being honored tomorrow, which is one of our hooks [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=350.0s)]
*  for getting you back tonight. What does that mean to you? What's tomorrow about for you? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=354.64s)]
*  I think it's grown in importance to me since I heard about it and obviously deeply honored. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=358.48s)]
*  But as the institution has been under fire, I feel like they could have probably made a much [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  easier choice, another choice that might not have raised eyebrows. Certainly I've been vocal [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  about my feelings about the administration and they've held strong to their selection of me for [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=379.12s)]
*  this honor. So I commend them. I thank Dr. Lonnie Bunch and all the good people at the Smithsonian [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  overall and the National Museum of American History. And so yes, I'm excited to be there. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  I certainly know that the folks that run these institutions who care deeply about justice and [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=398.72s)]
*  dignity are under fire. And so these are allies who need to know that artists stand in solidarity [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=402.56s)]
*  with them. So I'll be proud to be there tomorrow night. Yeah, tomorrow. Speak on the influence and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=409.04s)]
*  the power of culture, because it's something we've taken an interest in here on the beat. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=416.16s)]
*  And I don't know what it means when people meet up on it, but at a certain point you say, oh, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  if this film or this song has all these fans and people love it, and then it has all these [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=427.44s)]
*  opponents and enemies who hate it. They hate it so much they don't want it to exist. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=433.76s)]
*  To me, that sometimes reinforces that culture is powerful. And when we look at the many American [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=438.08000000000004s)]
*  traditions, but which includes a lot of homemade black art that seems to matter, or even I should [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=442.72s)]
*  say numerically, might punch above its weight, the weight of jazz or blues above its numerical [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=450.24s)]
*  representation, right? What do you see there at a time like this? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, jazz and blues and African American art over indexes from its origins to its [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=462.24s)]
*  echoing and reverberations to the culture. But overall, the impact of art on the culture is [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=467.12s)]
*  priceless. It's seismic. And that is why it's under fire. If you can shut up the artists, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=473.12s)]
*  if you can make us look away from history, then you do. As the quote that you stated before, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=480.72s)]
*  you do control minds, you control the moment. And so what is important is for artists to [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  continue to create. All art is homemade and handmade. It's heart made. And it comes from [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=493.6s)]
*  someone who expresses their point of view about the human condition. And whether that's political, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  cultural, whether it's about your lineage, whether it's about what's happening in the White House, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=507.28s)]
*  it's coming from a deep place of human expression. It must be. It's different than news. It's [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=511.28s)]
*  different than anything that is objective because art is deeply emotional. It's from- [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=519.6s)]
*  It's better than news. I'll tell you that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=525.76s)]
*  I'm not going there, Ari, but we can battle if you want. But it all has its place. And I think, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=528.88s)]
*  for me, as a student of history, I know there's so many examples of moments where art has really [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=536.0s)]
*  lifted the national mood when it's actually propelled us forward. And we're back to that [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=543.2s)]
*  place. And it's important that we continue to do our work. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  I have a question for you about political projection. And then we saved a little time [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  to talk Met Gala so we can end on a high note. But it's always interesting with projection [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=556.72s)]
*  because we try to be fair here. We talked to a lot of folks. I've had Trump folks on the show, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=561.6s)]
*  and I'll have them back on the show. But the political projection I see is a part of the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=566.72s)]
*  MAGA right saying, you guys are obsessed with race. You're obsessed with identity. You're fixated. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=572.64s)]
*  And then you go and you look at these orders and you look at the targeting and look at what's [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=579.76s)]
*  going on. And you go, I'm sorry. Who's obsessed? There's more than one way to do diversity [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  recruitment. America's had a multi-decade debate about recruitment for action programs. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=588.4000000000001s)]
*  You can look at the Fortune 100 and say, hmm, it's still 90% male CEOs, give or take. Does that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=593.9200000000001s)]
*  seem right? Or are we getting something wrong? We can debate it. But the whole obsessive thing, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=600.88s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about that in the headline from the Atlantic on the threats to African [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=605.36s)]
*  American history museum, which talks about how black resistance has always existed, the exhibit [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=609.2s)]
*  reminding people that existence is possible now, which is the exact sort of thing that's [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=615.2s)]
*  led authoritarian regimes to scrub examples of political resistance. What do you think of that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=619.36s)]
*  projection issue? Well, that's the wonderful piece by Clint Smith in the Atlantic. If you [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=624.4s)]
*  haven't read it, folks should. You know, the idea that what I'm often called online by the trolls [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=629.52s)]
*  and the, I imagine young men in their mother's basements sitting in their briefs is a race baiter. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=639.84s)]
*  But when you look at the executive orders and you look at almost every time Trump or the blonde [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=647.6s)]
*  woman who is at the podium doing something in the press room, she thinks, speaks, they are talking [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=652.72s)]
*  about race. This administration is obsessed with race. That whole side of things is obsessed with [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  race. This is part of the gaslighting, whether it's immigration, whether it's black folks, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=664.24s)]
*  it's brown folks, it's Muslims, it's people in the Middle East. It's this idea that, you know, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGVDKxP95HQ&t=670.4s)]
