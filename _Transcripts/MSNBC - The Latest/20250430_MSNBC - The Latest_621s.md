# USPS law enforcement assisting Trump's 'mass deportation' effort: WaPo
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q)
*  The Trump administration's mass deportation campaign reportedly has a new weapon, the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Postal Service. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=5.08s)]
*  The Washington Post is reporting that a little-known investigative arm of it has joined the federal [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=6.72s)]
*  task force to use data from mail and packages as part of a massive immigration crackdown. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=12.48s)]
*  That's according to two sources familiar and records obtained by the paper. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=19.0s)]
*  I want to bring in NBC News senior White House correspondent Kelly O'Donnell. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=22.92s)]
*  Also here with me is the Washington Post's Jacob Bogage, who is behind that reporting, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=27.16s)]
*  and Washington Post national reporter and MSNBC contributor Carol Lenig, author of Co-Author. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=31.76s)]
*  Just to be fair to your friendly co-author, a very stable genius and I alone can fix it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=38.36s)]
*  Thanks to all of you for being here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=44.44s)]
*  Jacob, even if you're not in any government system, there is still a chance that at some [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  point you use the mail. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=51.0s)]
*  What type of information could that give the government? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=53.32s)]
*  Well first of all, don't forget Carol's book Zero Fail on the Secret Service. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=57.52s)]
*  Excellent read. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=61.36s)]
*  Yes it is. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=62.36s)]
*  What kind of information could that give the Secret Service from, not the Secret Service, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=63.8s)]
*  immigration officials from your mail? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=67.56s)]
*  A lot of information. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=70.0s)]
*  Your name, your address, think about other people that live in your home, so something [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=72.12s)]
*  about your family structure. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=77.48s)]
*  There's mail tracking information or package tracking information, so if you order something [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=80.08s)]
*  via e-commerce, how that package or that envelope is getting to you, in some cases your credit [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=84.36s)]
*  card information, your IP address. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=90.72s)]
*  There's just an incredible depth and richness to this data that is different than what we've [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  reported on about data from your taxes or social security, because this is where the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=100.72s)]
*  government reaches you six days a week to give you your mail, the most kind of mundane [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=106.08s)]
*  government activity. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=111.84s)]
*  And so from there Jacob, how would they use that information to track down an undocumented [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=113.48s)]
*  person? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=119.48s)]
*  What we've been reporting on across federal agencies is homeland security investigators [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=121.48s)]
*  difficulty literally locating people, millions upon millions of people. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=128.32s)]
*  We reported at the IRS they were looking for seven million people to help the IRS locate [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=133.96s)]
*  them because they don't have accurate addresses for them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=139.72s)]
*  With the Postal Service you do have that accurate address and you can verify it day over day [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=145.0s)]
*  over day based on items that are being delivered. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=150.24s)]
*  So Carol, I think it's fair to say throughout these first 100 days plus of the Trump administration [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=154.8s)]
*  There have been headlines almost daily about the climate of fear that undocumented people [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=160.16s)]
*  are living in. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=165.39999999999998s)]
*  My colleagues at NBC for example just wrote about a married couple who self-deported. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=166.44s)]
*  They were so afraid that the undocumented partner who's been here 20 years from Mexico [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=172.0s)]
*  would get shipped to El Salvador. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=177.04s)]
*  Is this escalation that Jacob reports on a surprise at all or has fear and fear tactics [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=180.0s)]
*  always been a part of Donald Trump's game plan whether it was business or politics? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  Fear is always and has been in his first presidency and more dramatically now fear is a cornerstone [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  of Donald Trump's immigration policy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  Fear is part of what he's trying to instill in the federal workforce as well. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  I want to give a kudos to Jacob and Hannah Naitenson who broke this exclusive and keep [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  breaking exclusives on what is going on inside the federal government and also remark upon [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=216.96s)]
*  what's so startling about this, right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=223.44s)]
*  Two ironies for you, Chris. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=226.72s)]
*  One, in their story they describe a document in which a postal service individual is remarking [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=229.2s)]
*  on how we need to play nicely in the sandbox with the administration. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=237.04s)]
*  In other words, it implied that the postal service didn't want to basically turn over [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=242.64s)]
*  all of its sensitive data, much of it governed by the Privacy Act, but probably felt some [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=247.27999999999997s)]
*  pressure to do what the Department of Homeland Security and ultimately Stephen Miller and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  the President of the United States want accomplished which is more routes for how to arrest immigrants [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  illegal and not. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=266.08s)]
*  Second most important context and irony for me is that the Postal Service's Inspection Service, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=267.76s)]
*  this police force if you will, little known, was involved in the investigation of Donald Trump's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=274.4s)]
*  election interference case for which the special counsel indicted Donald Trump in 2023. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=281.84s)]
*  This Postal Inspection Service was critical to providing the evidence of how Donald Trump's [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  campaign had fomented and plotted and created a fake elector scheme to try to block the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=294.96s)]
*  certification of Congress. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=302.96s)]
*  And here in a new presidency they are essentially, from what we can tell, being pressured to help [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  in the immigration battle and policy that Donald Trump has now. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  So Kelly, the President, as you know in that extensive interview with ABC, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=315.44s)]
*  said his biggest accomplishment in his first 100 days has been [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  what he's been able to do at the border. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=324.08s)]
*  He stood by everyone being deported, is a bad guy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=325.92s)]
*  He says they're being careful. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  Does the administration think you can be careful without due process? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=333.84s)]
*  Well, Chris, one of the things that's notable about how the President's responding to these [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=340.24s)]
*  questions is he has a kind of a vigorous defense of his policy which we know is broadly popular [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  in terms of having a secure border. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=351.76s)]
*  The question about the tactics used, the legal authorities used, that's another area, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=353.92s)]
*  and Americans who are polled have some concerns about how that's been done. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=359.12s)]
*  The President had talked a lot about the worst offenders, people with criminal records being [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=363.76s)]
*  removed from the country. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=369.12s)]
*  We've seen it has gone much beyond that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=370.08s)]
*  The President today in the Cabinet meeting emphasized one of the things [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=372.72s)]
*  that you don't hear from him much, and that is he is saying it's the business [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  of the lawyers deferring to Attorney General Bondi and the Department of Justice, sort of [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=380.96s)]
*  giving himself some distance from some of these questions. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=386.08s)]
*  When he spoke with ABC's Terry Moran, he had a vigorous exchange about various aspects of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=388.96s)]
*  his policies on immigration and the question of due process, should due process be afforded to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=396.08s)]
*  all those who are in the United States, not just citizens but anyone in the United States. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  Here's part of the conversation he had in that interview. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=407.28s)]
*  In our country, even bad guys get due process, right? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=411.68s)]
*  If people come into our country illegally, there's a different standard. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  These are illegal. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=419.28s)]
*  They came in illegally. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=420.64s)]
*  But they get due process. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=421.76s)]
*  Well, they get a process where we have to get them out. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=423.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=427.44s)]
*  Let's talk about the Venezuelans. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=427.67999999999995s)]
*  They get whatever my lawyers say. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=428.79999999999995s)]
*  So he again is deferring to lawyers, but the Supreme Court over time has asserted that anyone [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=432.56s)]
*  in the United States is afforded certain constitutional protections. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=438.64s)]
*  Only where the Constitution gives specific rights to U.S. citizens is there a distinction. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  And so due process is something that should be afforded. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  Now, some of this, the administration argues that immigration courts have [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=452.0s)]
*  different legal standards and so forth. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=456.88s)]
*  But this is one of the thorniest areas for the administration. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=458.8s)]
*  The president was also asked if he's done anything in the Secretary of State to reach out to El [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=462.08s)]
*  Salvador on the case of Abrego Garcia. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=467.44s)]
*  They have not disclosed any action they've taken to facilitate, that's the word the Supreme Court [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=470.4s)]
*  used, putting that obligation on the administration to return Abrego Garcia for further processing [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=476.24s)]
*  or adjudication of his case. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=483.52s)]
*  He's the man from El Salvador but living in Maryland who's been the subject of so much attention. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=485.36s)]
*  So, Carol, what's the end goal here? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=491.92s)]
*  The pressure that the Department of Homeland Security feels is from the White House to meet [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=498.08s)]
*  a number, which are Washington Post reporters again, exclusively reported, one million. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=505.04s)]
*  One million immigrants are how many people Donald Trump and Stephen Miller want removed from the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=511.44s)]
*  country to basically sort of show the public they are delivering on the agenda. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=517.76s)]
*  It is very popular of securing our borders, especially our southern border. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=524.72s)]
*  But the problem is, Chris, that the rush to meet that political goal, that PR high, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=530.0s)]
*  is pressing the Department of Homeland Security to find people that they then deport and put on [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=538.0s)]
*  planes who may or may not be, as the president said in that ABC interview, illegal immigrants. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=544.08s)]
*  I mean, we now know about people that have been accidentally deported. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=550.8s)]
*  And the reason that Kilmar Abrego Garcia has gotten so much attention in the press [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  is because he was accidentally departed and put in an El Salvadoran prison, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=561.3599999999999s)]
*  and yet he is not being brought back. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=567.68s)]
*  So, the fear is that people are going to be deported not only without due process, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=570.56s)]
*  which is a fundamental right, but in the rush to meet this campaign, essentially goal, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHX5lx2ws1Q&t=575.84s)]
