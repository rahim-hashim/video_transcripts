# 'Some friction' between Trump and Netanyahu over disagreements on Middle East conflicts
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU)
*  And Yamiche is still with us, also joining us to discuss more on all this is Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=0.0s)]
*  bureau chief for USA Today, Susan Page, and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=4.24s)]
*  Joel Rubin. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=8.88s)]
*  Yamiche, the president chose three Middle Eastern countries for his first major foreign [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=9.88s)]
*  trip. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=15.24s)]
*  Why these countries, and what is the goal? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, it's a very interesting question. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  I want to remind people that he's going to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=21.36s)]
*  I say those three countries because it's important to kind of underscore exactly where he's going [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=29.0s)]
*  because, from my understanding and talking with White House officials and based on my [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  reporting, he's really looking to make deals and all kinds of deals, business deals, nuclear [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=36.88s)]
*  deals, oil deals. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=41.88s)]
*  The president is trying to go there and interface with these Middle Eastern leaders to essentially [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=43.84s)]
*  come back and be able to say, look, the United States is getting something out of this trip. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=48.6s)]
*  It's also interesting because he did also go to the Middle East for his first trip during [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  his first term overseas, his first major foreign trip. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=56.6s)]
*  This was seen a little bit as a snub back then to European allies. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=59.24s)]
*  Often presidents might go to France or to England. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=63.0s)]
*  But to see the president do this again, it really shows that in his mind he believes [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=66.08s)]
*  that he can make these sort of deals that Americans believe he can make in the Middle [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=69.64s)]
*  East. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=74.12s)]
*  So it will be very interesting to see how he rolls that all out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=75.12s)]
*  The other big news, and we heard the president touch on this as well, is we're awaiting Hamas's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=76.88s)]
*  release of Israeli-American hostage, Edan Alexander. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=80.64s)]
*  Here's what we heard from the president on this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm very happy to announce that Edan Alexander, an American citizen who until recently most [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=86.84s)]
*  thought was no longer living, thought was dead, is going to be released in about two [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=97.92s)]
*  hours actually. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=104.92s)]
*  And he's going to be released before the eyes of Steve Witkoff, who has done a fantastic [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=107.36s)]
*  job. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=114.92s)]
*  Yamiche, what do we know about what went into this, to getting Edan Alexander freed? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=115.92s)]
*  Well, this of course is a big moment because Edan Alexander, as you noted, is the last [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=123.48s)]
*  living U.S. hostage, the last living American hostage in Gaza, U.S. citizen in Gaza. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=129.8s)]
*  I also want to say that he's expected to be released in just the next few hours here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=136.32000000000002s)]
*  The president maybe in about 45 minutes ago said it would be in about two hours. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=140.28s)]
*  The president also said this was a step taken in good faith to put an end to this very brutal [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=144.36s)]
*  war. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=149.12s)]
*  And a Hamas official said that this release is part of efforts to achieve a ceasefire. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=150.12s)]
*  I also talked to Steve Witkoff over the weekend, and he told me, of course, he being the special [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  U.S. envoy, he's actually now in Israel to secure this release. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  He told me that this is really, he believes, a big gesture, that this is a testament, he [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  said, to President Trump's ability to negotiate, but that the family also that is ecstatic [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  to have Edan coming home. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=172.27999999999997s)]
*  But they were all, of course, couching this with the idea that everything will really [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=173.72s)]
*  be OK once he's back in the hands of U.S. officials and his family. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=177.2s)]
*  So still watching to see exactly when that release happens. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  But this is a really big moment, Ana. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=185.16s)]
*  Lana News coming from the White House this morning. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  Amish Alcindor, thank you for bringing us the latest on all fronts. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=189.88s)]
*  And Joel, there is still a lot we don't know about how this hostage release came to be. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=193.04s)]
*  President Trump is saying it's a step taken in good faith towards the United States. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=198.0s)]
*  How significant is it if the U.S. made this deal unilaterally with Hamas? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Ana, of course, first and foremost, getting Edan out is a victory for him, for [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=207.16s)]
*  his family. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=213.8s)]
*  It's a wonderful moment to see a humanitarian success. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  There still are 58 more hostages, both deceased and alive, that need to come out and that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  needs to be top priority. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=226.8s)]
*  This negotiation, it's a fascinating dynamic that we're watching right now. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=228.68s)]
*  But unfortunately, there's no clarity about how this fits into ending this war, getting [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=233.4s)]
*  the hostages out and getting relief into Gaza. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=239.36s)]
*  It seems almost like a one-off. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=242.8s)]
*  Hamas may be doing what others are doing in the region, providing some type of positive [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=244.88000000000002s)]
*  gift or action to try to take advantage of the fact that President Trump is going to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=252.28s)]
*  be in the region. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=257.56s)]
*  So I don't really know if this is going to lead to any further negotiations. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=258.56s)]
*  And also, without Israel in the room as part of this, it doesn't feel like a sustainable [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=261.56s)]
*  program that we're witnessing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=267.04s)]
*  So it's a wonderful moment, but a lot of open questions about how sustainable this [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=269.08s)]
*  is going to actually be. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=274.12s)]
*  Susan, NBC News reports there's been unexpected friction between President Trump and Prime [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=275.47999999999996s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu over Iran, over Israel's latest Gaza offensive, over the unilateral [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=280.2s)]
*  U.S. de-escalation with the Houthis. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=286.36s)]
*  The two leaders spoke by phone today regarding Gaza, but when President Trump heads to the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=288.68s)]
*  Middle East, he won't meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=293.2s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's notable that Israel is not on his itinerary as he goes to the three [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  Gulf states and a sign that, to the surprise of some, as you say, there is some friction [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=301.64s)]
*  between the President and Netanyahu. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=307.64s)]
*  They have been such close allies for so long, but I think there is frustration in the Trump [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=309.62s)]
*  administration at the difficulty of getting movement on the situation in Gaza in any significant [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=315.6s)]
*  way, Ana. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdy8OV8LlqU&t=322.40000000000003s)]
