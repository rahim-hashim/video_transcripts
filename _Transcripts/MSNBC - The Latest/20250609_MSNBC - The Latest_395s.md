Video Description: Members of the California National Guard arrived in Los Angeles Sunday morning in response to Friday and Saturday's protest against federal immigration raids.  President Donald Trump moved to deploy the 2,000 members over the opposition of California Gov. Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, who called the move inflammatory and unnecessary.  Julian Castro, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and now an MSNBC political analyst, along with Don Calloway, host of The Caucus Room Podcast and CEO of Pine Street Strategies, and republican strategist and MSNBC political analyst Susan Del Percio discuss these latest developments, and more.

# Trump wants 'these images, but it's for all the wrong reasons': analyst
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ)
*  Julian, your gut reaction to all this. Trump was thanking the National Guard for a job [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  well done last night, before they were even there. Is he more focused on the optics than [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  the reality of this situation unfolding? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=11.42s)]
*  Well, of course he is. The other thing that's going on, of course, Alex, is that they're [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=14.08s)]
*  provoking this. As Gabe was saying, they want these images. But it's for all the wrong reasons. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=21.0s)]
*  It's because they're provoking what are peaceful demonstrators. And we've seen this before. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=28.52s)]
*  We saw this in Lafayette Square on June 1st, 2020. Folks remember the tear gas being fired, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=34.58s)]
*  Trump going to that church and holding a Bible up. This is what he likes to do. It's part [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=40.86s)]
*  of his authoritarian impulse. We saw it when he was campaigning in 2015 and 2016, when [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  he promised to pay the legal bills of folks who would rough up protesters at his rallies. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=51.04s)]
*  That's Donald Trump. So there's a lot of mistruths, a lot of lies coming out of this [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=57.28s)]
*  administration. And one of the demonstrators are the problem. ICE is the problem right now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=62.04s)]
*  Well, Susan, let's point to the mayor and governor who did not ask for the National [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=67.52s)]
*  Guard. So Trump went over their heads using a rule that's meant for when there is rebellion [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=73.8s)]
*  or danger of rebellion against the U.S. government. Does it seem like a proportional response [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=78.08s)]
*  to what we've been seeing? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=85.04s)]
*  It is not, Alex, because the governor and or the—well, the governor would be the one [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  to call in the National Guard. They don't want them there. They know their city. And [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=92.56s)]
*  it is—it is what—I rarely agree with Governor Newsom, but Donald Trump is sending those [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=97.04s)]
*  folks there to make a spectacle. This is the visual that Donald Trump wants. And it is—you [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  know, it goes against the wish of a governor from a president who claims he's into states' [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=110.0s)]
*  But more importantly, it creates a tinderbox situation potentially. And that's what we [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=115.56s)]
*  should be more concerned about, just something sparking potential violence. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=120.84s)]
*  And here's why this is not new for Los Angeles, Dawn, because L.A. Mayor Karen Bass says, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=126.88s)]
*  in fact, that mass civil unrest, just like the 1992 Rodney King riots, which I well remember [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=132.4s)]
*  living there, is what happens when there is a large-scale presence of troops. So what [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=138.22s)]
*  is the risk of scaling up the federal response to this level? How do you see it? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  The risk is that it will absolutely incite and be an incendiary measure for not only [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  protesters but for just average people who want to protect citizens. I think this is [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=155.12s)]
*  a seminal and extraordinarily important moment in American civil rights history. We've all [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=159.16000000000003s)]
*  acknowledged that this has been done, the National Guard deployed, not only against [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  the wishes, but without the request of the sitting governor. The last time that the National [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=169.11999999999998s)]
*  Guard was deployed to the state in military fashion, without the request of the governor, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=173.44s)]
*  was in 1965, when LBJ sent the National Guard to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to forcibly integrate [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=177.76s)]
*  Vivian Malone into the University of Alabama. The last time this extraordinary measure was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=184.92s)]
*  used was to enforce civil rights. President Trump is using it to trample upon civil rights. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=190.32s)]
*  It is a stark juxtaposition and we should never forget the scope of history and where [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=195.88s)]
*  this fits precisely in it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=199.72s)]
*  Julian, our colleague Jacob Soboroff spoke exclusively with the Border Czar Tom Homan [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  about what he says are necessary arrests of protesters. Take a listen. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=206.72s)]
*  Anybody has a right to protest, they've got the first amendment rights. But when you appeal [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=212.88s)]
*  to a federal law enforcement officer, that's a crime. When you put hands on them, of course, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=216.88s)]
*  that's a crime. When you prevent them from doing their job, that's a crime. So, you know, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=222.16s)]
*  I've said since January 20th, you can protest all you want. When you cross that line, we're [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=226.52s)]
*  going to be seeing a prosecution. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=231.08s)]
*  Okay, let's remind our viewers that this administration pardoned more than 1,500 people convicted [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=233.08s)]
*  in the January 6th attack who were trying to impede the peaceful transfer of power, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=238.72s)]
*  including many who attacked police officers. Is it credible when this administration says [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=244.28s)]
*  the focus of moves like this we're seeing in Southern California is to protect law enforcement? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=249.6s)]
*  No, it's not. I mean, they've shown this administration, and Donald Trump especially, has shown that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=254.32s)]
*  they really don't care about protecting law enforcement. He showed that by pardoning all [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=262.04s)]
*  those January 6th rioters who violated many laws and, of course, beat up and hurt law [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=266.0s)]
*  enforcement. On top of that, Alex, they have no credibility in general with regard to these [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=277.12s)]
*  enforcement actions. Video after video has shown that these agents are the ones provoking [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=281.12s)]
*  protesters and also making up, you know, aggression by these protesters that later video shows [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=286.76s)]
*  people were not aggressive. They've done that over and over. They've lost all credibility. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=295.36s)]
*  Can I ask you, Don and Susan, to react to the same question relative to, you know, comparing [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=300.8s)]
*  to what we've seen from this administration regarding January 6th and the pardoning of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  1,500 protesters there. Don, you first, then Susan. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  No, there's no credibility here, and I think that the administration is just hoping that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=311.36s)]
*  they're not called out. That's why it's extraordinarily important that we remind folks that there [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=315.52s)]
*  actually was an insurrection, and this was not that. This is a direct response to Stephen [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=320.0s)]
*  Miller's heinous deportation order of 3,000 people per day. There are not 3,000 violent [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  criminals to be grabbed every day. What you're going to have to do is go into and grab normal [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=330.48s)]
*  everyday folks who are working hard to contribute to this country, and there's no logical parallel [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  between what we're seeing ICE do here versus what we saw on January 6th, none whatsoever. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=340.56s)]
*  Final word to you, Susan. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=345.36s)]
*  And it's no surprise that Donald Trump wants ICE to be more aggressive in doing that. There [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=348.12s)]
*  was a junior in high school in New York City arrested for checking in, which he is legally [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=353.4s)]
*  required to do, and at the courthouse he was arrested and sent to Pennsylvania. Those are [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=360.35999999999996s)]
*  the stories that start getting out there that will have a backlash against Trump because [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  he always takes it a step too far. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emD0H3wbJDQ&t=372.44s)]
