# 'What we're seeing is authoritarianism': Zohran Mamdani slams Trump's protest crackdown
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA)
*  All right, we are back with our continuing coverage of breaking news from California, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=0.0s)]
*  massive protests blocking downtown L.A.'s Highway 101. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=4.84s)]
*  L.A. police have now declared an unlawful assembly. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=8.16s)]
*  They have begun to disperse those that had gathered there and shut that highway down. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=10.96s)]
*  Let's continue this conversation now with New York State Assemblymember and New York [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=16.56s)]
*  City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=20.28s)]
*  Zohran, it's great to have you back on the show. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=22.6s)]
*  We wanted to talk to you about what's happening here in New York City, but there is a through [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=26.6s)]
*  line between the protests that we saw yesterday and what is happening right now in Los Angeles, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=29.08s)]
*  two major cities in America, the two largest cities, two cities that rely heavily on immigrant [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=33.6s)]
*  populations, diverse immigrant populations, undocumented immigrant populations. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=39.16s)]
*  How are you reacting to what you're seeing play out in these cities and this dramatic [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=44.08s)]
*  escalation by the administration to deploy the National Guard and whether it could happen [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  right here in our city? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=52.94s)]
*  ZOHRA RAMANI, New York City Mayoral Candidate for Mayoral Candidate for Mayoral Candidate [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=53.94s)]
*  for Mayoral Candidate for Mayoral Candidate for Mayoral Candidate for Mayoral Candidate [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=54.94s)]
*  for Mayoral Candidate for Mayoral Candidate for Mayoral Candidate for Mayoral Candidate [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=55.94s)]
*  for Mayoral Candidate for Mayoral Candidate for Mayoral Candidate for Mayoral Candidate [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=56.94s)]
*  right now is authoritarianism. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=58.099999999999994s)]
*  And what our city and every city needs is a leader who will look it in the eyes and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=60.82s)]
*  not see a reflection of themselves, because this isn't just an attack on immigrants who [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=64.96s)]
*  are being picked up by masked men and unmarked cars. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=70.34s)]
*  This is an attack on the very essence of our cities and our states and our country. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=73.52s)]
*  And we are seeing too many so-called leaders across this country who are sitting idly [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=77.78s)]
*  by as this takes place. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=82.82s)]
*  When we know that Donald Trump never rewards concessions, he can only be defeated if you're [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=85.16s)]
*  willing to fight him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=89.89999999999999s)]
*  And that's the kind of fight we have to bring in this country in this moment, a fight that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  means in New York City standing up for our sanctuary city policies, putting funding towards [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  legal representation of New Yorkers who are in detention proceedings, knowing that, when [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=99.6s)]
*  we do so, we increase the likelihood they will be home with their family by 11-fold. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  And knowing that this isn't intellectual, this is something that is the difference between [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=107.44s)]
*  student like Dylan being hundreds of miles away in an ICE detention facility or back [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=113.0s)]
*  home with his mother and his two siblings, someone like Mahmoud Khalil, who today marks [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=117.6s)]
*  three months since he was arrested for no crime at all in his apartment building lobby [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=121.88s)]
*  and couldn't even witness the birth of his first child. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=126.56s)]
*  I want to get a bit more of if your mayor and our president were to bring the National [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=129.88s)]
*  Guard here, what you think you would actually be able to do? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=137.68s)]
*  A lot of New Yorkers are aware of the fact that Mayor Eric Adams has not been shy about [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  cozying up to Donald Trump. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=145.92s)]
*  A lot of immigrants in this city are also very nervous. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=148.04s)]
*  They're also wondering if they should continue to show up to appointments or to school or [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  to doctor's appointments at this point. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  So I think they'd be looking to you and wondering what you would do as they look at these images [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=157.0s)]
*  if this were to come to New York City. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  What do you imagine would be the decisions you would be making tonight and the message [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=164.32s)]
*  you'd be sharing with New Yorkers about how you'd keep them safe? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=168.9s)]
*  The message first and foremost is to recognize that immigrant New Yorkers are New Yorkers. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=172.06s)]
*  And I say that as an immigrant myself. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=176.18s)]
*  I came to this city and this country at the age of seven. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=177.74s)]
*  It's the city that I fell in love with, the city where I got married, the city where I [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=180.82000000000002s)]
*  got my citizenship. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=183.78s)]
*  And yet I know that just blocks away from where I got that citizenship, where I was [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  sworn in, is today Federal Plaza, where immigrants are terrified to go for their regular check-ins. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=188.66000000000003s)]
*  And we know that the federal government has an immense amount of power to be able to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=194.68s)]
*  inflict this kind of terror upon people across this country. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=199.38s)]
*  And yet what we've seen from our current mayor is to build upon that power and allow the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=202.4s)]
*  NYPD to often serve as accomplices to it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=207.08s)]
*  There was a moment when a number of undocumented New Yorkers were being arrested at Federal [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=210.52s)]
*  Plaza and the NYPD, the strategic response group, was dispatched to then arrest New Yorkers [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  who were observing that, including a pastor. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=219.62s)]
*  This is the kind of practice I would bring to an end, because we need to make clear that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=221.96s)]
*  sanctuary city policies, it's not only the law of this city, it's also something that's [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=225.68s)]
*  kept New Yorkers safe. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=229.44s)]
*  And had we had those same policies in Maryland, Kilmar would never have actually been taken [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=231.0s)]
*  to El Salvador. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=235.02s)]
*  These are the kinds of policies that keep families together. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=236.14000000000001s)]
*  As the next mayor, I will not only build upon them, I will ensure 100 percent compliance [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  with them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=241.88s)]
*  So we've seen protesters in California try to organize peacefully. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=242.88s)]
*  Apparently some of our reporters have described some of the activity as unruly but generally [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=248.44s)]
*  peaceful. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=252.56s)]
*  What advice would you have to New Yorkers who also want to register their dissent, who [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=254.28s)]
*  want to register their dissent peacefully, and don't want to play into this narrative [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=260.2s)]
*  that Donald Trump seems eager to spin, that these are riots, that these are people who [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=267.24s)]
*  don't respect the law, who are interfering with federal operations? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=272.98s)]
*  I would encourage New Yorkers to use their First Amendment rights to peacefully protest [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=277.32s)]
*  if they are in opposition to what we all must oppose, which is an authoritarian administration [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  looking to detain, disappear, and push out so many of the very people that we love and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=286.64s)]
*  make this city and this country our home. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=292.64s)]
*  And I would say that because also too often Democrats are worried about what Donald Trump [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=295.36s)]
*  will say about something. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=299.6s)]
*  And so we retreat and allow there to be a void. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  When in fact mayors of our cities, the mayor of New York City, is considered to have the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=303.84s)]
*  second largest bully pulpit in America, that's a bully pulpit that should be used to define [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=307.44s)]
*  the truth of what is happening and to push back on these horrific kind of narratives [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=312.2s)]
*  that are then used as the justification to disappear people hundreds of miles away. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  Let me ask you really quickly, should ICE be abolished? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=320.64s)]
*  I mean, you and I are old enough to remember when that was actually a policy proposal by [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  people in this country. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=328.67999999999995s)]
*  We've seen the Biden administration previously increase funding for ICE. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=329.88s)]
*  It was a missed opportunity that people say maybe we wouldn't be in this situation if [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=334.68s)]
*  ICE didn't have this kind of funding. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=337.64s)]
*  But from this vantage point now, what you're seeing in Los Angeles, should ICE be abolished? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=339.6s)]
*  I believe it should. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=344.36s)]
*  And it's been a privilege to have been represented by Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez as a fellow [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=345.36s)]
*  representative of Astoria. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=350.12s)]
*  And she is one of the leaders of that call and has continued to make that call. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  And I've been proud to receive her endorsement to become the next mayor of the city. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  New York City mayoral candidate Zoran Mamdani, thank you so much for joining us this evening. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=359.64s)]
*  Much more of our breaking news coverage is coming up at the top of the hour. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=364.24s)]
*  This is The Weekend Prime Time. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfcvaDtfrqA&t=367.92s)]
