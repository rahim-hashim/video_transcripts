# 'We should have a dialogue': Why Rep. Ro Khanna doesn't think Dems should write off Elon Musk
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA)
*  Congressman Ro Khanna joins us now. Congressman, you've gotten some pushback from some progressives [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=0.0s)]
*  about those comments, and you stated on your own substack yesterday that you did not say Democrats [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=5.2s)]
*  should invite Musk into a position of power in the party. Can you clarify what you did mean? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=10.4s)]
*  Well, I appreciate your very fair summary of what I said. Look, I have been one of the loudest [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  critics of what Elon Musk did. What he did with USA dismantling it was unconscionable, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=24.56s)]
*  led to deaths of kids in Africa. What he did in dismantling NIH, the Veterans Affairs [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=31.36s)]
*  Department, without constitutional authority was unconscionable. I voted just, yes, two days ago [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=40.08s)]
*  to subpoena him. He's texted me in the past that my career is over, given that I've stood up to him. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  What I've said is that now that he is turning his fire against this bill, which is going to take [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=53.36s)]
*  insurance away from 13 million people, now that he's speaking his mind about the blanket tariffs [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  that tech leaders have had concerns about but have bit their tongue, that he's speaking out about [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=64.8s)]
*  the problems of revocation of the clean energy tax credit—and I'm sure he's opposed to the blanket [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=70.0s)]
*  ban on international students, of which he was one—that we should have a dialogue and make sure [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=75.84s)]
*  that we're encouraging him to speak out against that awful agenda, as how other tech leaders [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=80.88s)]
*  follow. Well, but to be clear, he has spoken out against the so-called big, beautiful bill, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  not because his heart is breaking for the 13 million people who would stand to become uninsured. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=92.16s)]
*  He's speaking out against it, presumably—well, he says it's about the deficit, which maybe would [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=98.16s)]
*  imply even bigger cuts to the safety net, but it seems like his real motivation has to do with how [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=103.28s)]
*  it affects him personally. Does that play any role in amplifying his voice? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=108.56s)]
*  Well, I think the reason he's speaking out, at least on face value from his tweets, is most [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=113.92s)]
*  because of the deficit. We have a deficit, as you know well, because you're very well studied in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=121.04s)]
*  economics, of about 7 percent of GDP. This would explode the deficits to 8.6 percent of GDP. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=126.64s)]
*  Historically, over the last 50 years, we've never, on average, had deficits more than 4 percent of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=135.68s)]
*  GDP. President Biden's plans were to bring the deficit down to under 4 percent if he had been [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=140.8s)]
*  reelected. This is exploding it, and you've got Jamie Dimon and Ray Dalio warning that this is [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  going to cause havoc in the bond market, and I think Elon Musk sincerely believes it. And by the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=153.84s)]
*  way, it's deficit spending for no productive end, no infrastructure, no child care, simply to give [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=158.4s)]
*  tax breaks to the billionaires. Now, I chaired Bernie Sanders' campaign. I'm for Medicare for [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=163.92s)]
*  all. Obviously, I detest any of the Medicaid cuts, but if we can have a voice, a word for Donald [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump pointing out the economic chaos that Trump's agenda is causing, pointing out, finally, to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  business leaders that Democrats are far better at fiscal responsibility and economic management [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=181.44s)]
*  and economic growth because we don't put blanket tariffs or explode deficits, I think that's helpful. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=186.16s)]
*  So, let me play for you, if I can, Congressman, a sound bite that you said when you were—you've [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=190.96s)]
*  been on the fighting oligarchy tour. So, let me play for you something you said back in April [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=196.88000000000002s)]
*  with Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Take a listen. Bernie Sanders warned us. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  In 2016, he warned us about the unholy alliance of wealth and power, but the Democratic leadership [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=209.76s)]
*  rejected him. Then, in 2020, he warned us again about money in politics, but the establishment [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=222.88s)]
*  betrayed him. Now, for a third time, he's warning us about billionaires taking over our democracy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=233.84s)]
*  And guess what? Guess what? This time, this time, Democrats in America are finally listening. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=253.12s)]
*  So, a two-part for you, Congressman. One, do you still stand by that? And two, is this simply a [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  case of like the enemy of my enemy is my friend, that you're looking at Donald Trump as a threat, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=269.28s)]
*  and if Elon Musk is going to be in opposition to Donald Trump and his agenda, then you want to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=273.84s)]
*  welcome him into the fold of the Democratic—not party, but certainly the Democratic wing, if you [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=278.79999999999995s)]
*  will, of our politics. Yes, I stand by every word. I was very proud to co-chair Bernie [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  Sanders' campaign. I didn't realize when you speak at a rally, it sounds so loud on television. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=292.96s)]
*  Maybe I could have delivered it better, but other than that, I stand by the words. But my point [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=296.23999999999995s)]
*  on there was that Elon Musk spent $250 million on a super PAC to get Donald Trump elected. That's [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=302.23999999999995s)]
*  what Bernie Sanders calls the oligarchy. That's what I call the unholy alliance of wealth and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=309.76s)]
*  power. I've never taken a dollar from Elon Musk. I've known him 15 years. He blurred my first book, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=314.24s)]
*  but I've never taken any money from him. I have a bill with Summer Lee to ban super PACs. I'm not [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=319.04s)]
*  saying let's go ask Elon Musk to be funding Democratic campaigns. In fact, Donald Trump and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=324.72s)]
*  J.D. Vance are the ones who are threatening him. I mean, Donald Trump threatened him if you fund a [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  Democratic campaign that he's going to come after him. But what I'm just saying is engage in a [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=337.04s)]
*  dialogue where he's articulating positions that we agree with to amplify those. And by the way, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=343.36s)]
*  he turned that whole of Twitter as basically one machine against Kamala Harris. If he's putting out [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=349.68s)]
*  things criticizing Donald Trump and other tech leaders are putting it out, I think that's helpful. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  But I would not take any super PAC money from him or any money from him. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  Congressman, let's go back to one beautiful bill for a second. Can you talk a bit about the current [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  provisions in the bill that ban regulation of AI and specifically from local and state governments [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=374.24s)]
*  who may want to have some input in what kind of data centers are being put in their communities? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=381.12s)]
*  Do you think that that's a provision that survives as it goes through the Senate? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  It's one of the most dangerous provisions in this bill that hasn't gotten enough attention. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=391.28s)]
*  I did an interview with Verge where I said that we need to get rid of this 10-year [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=397.35999999999996s)]
*  moratorium, which would prevent states, or 50 states, from doing any legislation to protect kids [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=402.08s)]
*  from being addicted to social media because of addictive algorithms. It would protect a state [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=409.11999999999995s)]
*  from passing a law saying truck drivers need to have their jobs. You can't just have self-driving [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=414.4s)]
*  trucks. It would protect us from having algorithmic rent increases. Marjorie Taylor Greene was so [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=419.36s)]
*  flabbergasted by this. She said she wouldn't have voted for the bill if it was in there. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  Unfortunately, the Republicans now still have the legislation in there. They're saying that [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=432.32s)]
*  you're not going to get broadband funding if you don't accept a moratorium threatening [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  states with funding to expand broadband unless they accept this. And it's terrible. I've had my [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=443.36s)]
*  phone blow up with tech leaders upset at me that have spoken out about this, but this is a total [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=448.08s)]
*  handout. We can't have unregulated AI for 10 years. And one final point on this, if you don't [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=453.03999999999996s)]
*  have the states legislating, then you're not going to put pressure on the federal government to [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=458.64s)]
*  legislate. The way you get the federal government is you get a quilt of state regulations, and then [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=462.4s)]
*  it forces the federal government to act. And we still haven't passed social media legislation, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=467.2s)]
*  so the ability of Congress to regulate tech is pretty abysmal. Congressman, we've been watching [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=471.68s)]
*  footage of the protests in L.A. in your home state, obviously not your district, this evening, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=478.0s)]
*  and I'm just curious if you have any thoughts on how those are being handled thus far, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=484.56s)]
*  if you are hearing concerns from your own constituents about ICE activity or other [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=489.6s)]
*  kinds of immigration enforcement happening within your district. Well, people are afraid. I mean, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=495.84000000000003s)]
*  I have a lot of people who are immigrants in the district, but here's what—I had a town hall [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=504.0s)]
*  right before this hit, and one gentleman said, he's gone to some of these protests, and what would [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=509.28000000000003s)]
*  I tell him? Because he's engaged in peaceful protests, but he's afraid of being arrested. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=516.88s)]
*  And people like him are afraid of being arrested. There's a school teacher. I mean, you had a lot [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=522.48s)]
*  of people there who are simply there to protest. Now, whether you agree or disagree with what ICE [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=526.96s)]
*  is doing, certainly we can all agree that people in this country should have the right to have [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=533.2s)]
*  peaceful protests. And from the reports I have heard and from some of what my colleagues have [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=537.12s)]
*  shared, there are peaceful protesters who have been arrested or harassed, and that's not America. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is the last time I want to lecture from the Republican Party about free speech, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=550.4000000000001s)]
*  because they're not respecting the free speech of peaceful protesters. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvPqk8yAZA&t=555.9200000000001s)]
