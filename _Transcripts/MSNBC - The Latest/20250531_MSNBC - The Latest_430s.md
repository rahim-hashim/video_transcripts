# Trump ‘shooting himself in the foot’ over grudge with national security staff: Journalist
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0)
*  Ukraine is resisting U.S. and Russian pressure to commit to attending peace talks Monday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=0.0s)]
*  until Russia submits its plan to end the war. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=5.64s)]
*  U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal visited President Zelensky Friday in Kiev [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=8.76s)]
*  and warned of a new sanctions bill being prepared against Moscow. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=13.64s)]
*  President Trump, meanwhile, says he will know in a couple of weeks whether Russian President [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=18.52s)]
*  Vladimir Putin wants to end the war. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=22.16s)]
*  We're going to find out whether or not he's tapping us along or not. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=24.32s)]
*  And if he is, we'll respond a little bit differently, but it'll take about a week and a half, two [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=30.12s)]
*  weeks. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=34.6s)]
*  I have gotten to see things, and I was very surprised that rockets being shot into cities [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=35.6s)]
*  like Kiev during a negotiation that I felt was maybe very close to ending. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=44.16s)]
*  And I don't like being surprised. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=50.08s)]
*  So I'm very disappointed in that way. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=51.98s)]
*  Joining me now, Tom Nichols, staff writer with The Atlantic, professor emeritus of national [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=55.81999999999999s)]
*  security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College and instructor at the Harvard Extension School. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=60.059999999999995s)]
*  And his latest headline says, Trump's tirades aren't swaying Putin. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=64.5s)]
*  Tom, welcome. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=69.3s)]
*  You really think it's going to take him a week and a half or so to figure out if he [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=70.62s)]
*  believes that Putin really wants to end the war? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=74.46s)]
*  Because I'm curious your read on where Monday's negotiation stands. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=77.82s)]
*  And when you see Senators Graham and Blumenthal teaming up to visit Kiev, do you expect the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=82.24s)]
*  strongest action against Putin to come from Congress instead of the White House? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=88.28s)]
*  Well, first, it's important to remember that the president has this kind of verbal tick [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=93.17999999999999s)]
*  when he's stumped or trying to buy time. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=100.3s)]
*  And it's always two weeks. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=104.06s)]
*  It's two weeks or within a few. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=106.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a meaningless time schedule. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=108.34s)]
*  It's just something he says. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=114.9s)]
*  That's a way of saying, I don't want to talk about this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=116.78s)]
*  It's embarrassing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=119.84s)]
*  I'll figure it out in two weeks and hope that people pay attention to something else. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=120.84s)]
*  As to Graham and Blumenthal, bipartisan delegation showing up in Kiev, it would be great. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=126.42s)]
*  As Hemingway wrote, wouldn't it be pretty to think so? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=135.92s)]
*  But without the president, without his backing, sanctions and other measures against Moscow [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=140.64s)]
*  aren't going to go very far. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  It's great to see U.S. senators in Kiev showing support for the Ukrainians. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=148.72s)]
*  But I think I'd almost rather see Senator Graham at the White House telling President [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=155.2s)]
*  Trump, no, Putin doesn't want peace. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  No, you don't have to wait two weeks. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=163.92s)]
*  And yes, there are things you can do right now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=165.6s)]
*  We've exchanged your update on social media Tuesday when President Trump said if it wasn't [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=168.4s)]
*  for him, lots of really bad things would have happened to Russia, adding that Putin is, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=172.32s)]
*  quote, playing with fire. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=176.64s)]
*  That was followed by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev saying, quote, I only know [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  of one really bad thing, World War Three. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=183.12s)]
*  I hope Trump understands this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=186.04s)]
*  Is this a threat from Russia or is it a reminder to Trump? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=189.24s)]
*  As he often says, he wants to prevent World War Three. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=192.8s)]
*  Yeah, Dmitry Medvedev, the former president, he's kind of become Russia's chief. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=195.72s)]
*  Technically, he's the deputy chairman of the National Security Council there. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=202.4s)]
*  But what he is is he's Russia's chief internet troll. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=207.88000000000002s)]
*  And he says stuff like this all the time about, you know, nuking London and taking out Europe [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=212.08s)]
*  and, you know, just lots of crazy stuff. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=217.92s)]
*  So I'm not too worried about that part of it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=223.0s)]
*  The bigger problem is that the president just doesn't either understand or doesn't care [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=227.27999999999997s)]
*  that this war is not just some real estate transaction. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  He seems to still believe that if he just calls Putin and says, you do this, I do that, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=236.92s)]
*  you know, we both make money, everything's going to be fine. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  And again, the president's tweet or post is kind of like his two weeks tick. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  He says it's very common for him in many instances to say, if only I had been around, bad things [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  wouldn't have happened. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=261.76s)]
*  I mean, it's really a great position to say, oh, there's all kinds of bad things in the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=262.76s)]
*  world. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  And if not, if I hadn't been around, if I had been around, they wouldn't have happened. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  It's just a kind of a go to for him. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=271.0s)]
*  But I wouldn't be too concerned about Medvedev. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=272.96s)]
*  He says stuff like this all the time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=276.24s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  Former president then becoming Internet troll. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  So your colleague Thomas Wright wrote about Trump's recent move to slash the National [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=281.52s)]
*  Security Council, saying Trump had been gunning for the NSC since 2019 when two staffers filed [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=285.72s)]
*  a whistleblower complaint about his call with Zelensky and that got him impeached. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=291.68s)]
*  Is Trump still carrying a grudge despite finishing out his first term without significant penalty [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  and getting elected to a second? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=304.64s)]
*  OK, nobody carries a grudge like Donald Trump, for one thing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=307.64s)]
*  So not only is he carrying a grudge, but he carries grudges institutionally. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=312.44s)]
*  He is mad about being impeached and being defeated, even though he says he wasn't. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=318.28s)]
*  He was beaten in 2020. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=323.48s)]
*  And he not only blames the NSC, he blames Zelensky, he blames the whole nation of Ukraine, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=326.36s)]
*  he blames the Democratic Party, he blames everybody. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=330.34s)]
*  So, yeah, he's still carrying a grudge. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=334.32s)]
*  And this is really shooting himself in the foot because he needs the NSC. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=336.12s)]
*  The problem is that people like the president and the people around him don't like organizations [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=340.72s)]
*  like the NSC because they're full of experts. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=346.84s)]
*  They're full of people who work the problem. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=348.84s)]
*  And that doesn't go very well when he says, I want to do X, Y and Z. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=352.0s)]
*  And they say, well, there, you know, you can do whatever you want, Mr. President, but there [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=356.0s)]
*  are problems with that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=359.56s)]
*  Here are some costs. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=361.56s)]
*  Here are some things that you have to worry about. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=362.64s)]
*  This president doesn't want to hear any of that stuff. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=365.32s)]
*  And the NSC exists to tell him stuff like that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=367.88s)]
*  That's what it's there for. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=373.0s)]
*  It's the president's kind of personal foreign policy, interagency support staff and think [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=374.88s)]
*  tank all rolled into one, supposedly or normally headed by a national security adviser who [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=381.76s)]
*  gives him the best advice, handles all these contending institutions and opinions. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=388.42s)]
*  None of that is happening because what the president really wants is just tell me that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=393.42s)]
*  the things I want to do are good and don't give me any guff about any problems or costs. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=397.7s)]
*  OK, Tom Nichols, always good to talk to you, my friend. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=405.18s)]
*  Come see us soon. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=408.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=409.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2IPJ5ozE0&t=418.42s)]
