Video Description: Rep. Jamie Raskin talks with Jen Psaki about why he feels it is in the public interest for the files associated with notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein to be released, to end their use as a political football and to show once and for all whether members of the Trump administration have been using Epstein as propaganda or whether there is substantive material the public should know.

# 'Everything should be released': Raskin calls making Epstein files public
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE)
*  Joining me now is someone who is asking questions, and he continues to, Congressman Jamie Raskin, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrat of Maryland, and the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=5.12s)]
*  He and 15 other committee Democrats have demanded that Attorney General Pam Bondi release any [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=8.48s)]
*  mention of Donald Trump in the Justice Department's files on Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=12.64s)]
*  So this has been a strange week. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=18.12s)]
*  I don't know how else to define it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=20.2s)]
*  And you are a part of the story, which is also strange. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=22.64s)]
*  So let me just start by asking you, is it weird to, I guess, be on sort of the same [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=25.48s)]
*  side, at least in demanding information, as people like Alex Jones and others, who you [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  probably agree with absolutely nothing on? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=35.36s)]
*  Well, we called for the release of Epstein files in the Biden administration. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=37.68s)]
*  We've been consistent all along in saying these should be opened up to the public. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=42.84s)]
*  All of the charges against Epstein were dismissed after his death, of course. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=47.8s)]
*  His associate, Ms. Maxwell, was convicted on five charges, as well as another French [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=53.0s)]
*  associate was prosecuted and then, I believe, took his own life. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=59.6s)]
*  At this point, all the trials are over, and everything should be released to the public, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=65.04s)]
*  in the public interest, especially after Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, Dan Bongino, the FBI Director, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=70.88s)]
*  Dash Patel, and the attorney general herself all stated that this was information of interest [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=78.92s)]
*  to the public and everybody should be able to get a hold of it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=85.92s)]
*  So look, there's two possibilities here, Jen. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=89.76s)]
*  One is that all of these people, including Elon Musk, actually know that Donald Trump [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=92.48s)]
*  is implicated or other people high up in the government or the Republican Party are implicated [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=98.6s)]
*  and they're trying to cover it up at this point, or else all of it was just propaganda [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=104.04s)]
*  from the beginning. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=111.04s)]
*  But look what happens when you use propaganda. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=113.56s)]
*  You know, W.H. Auden said propaganda was the use of magic by those who no longer believe [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=115.64s)]
*  in it against those who still do. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=121.32s)]
*  And so you've got millions of people in MAGA who are saying, wait a second, you were feeding [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=123.88s)]
*  us on a steady diet of release these tapes for all of these months and all of these years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=127.76s)]
*  But you saying that there's really nothing there? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=133.56s)]
*  I mean, that would incline us towards the first theory that there's really a lot there. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  There are a lot of facts there that the public should know about. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=139.4s)]
*  But if it's completely empty, release it in that case. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=141.8s)]
*  And if there's stuff in there we need to know, then the public has a right to know, as the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=144.84s)]
*  Republicans have been saying all along. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=149.2s)]
*  So I guess I do find myself in the same camp as Dan Bongino and MAGA saying, let's release [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  everything as Trump promised during the campaign. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  He didn't promise to throw 14 million people off of their Medicaid, but he did promise [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=160.84s)]
*  to release the Epstein tapes. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=165.4s)]
*  Do you think, I'm sure you've thought about why they did this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=168.12s)]
*  Why do you think that Attorney General Pam Bondi is holding back? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=171.76s)]
*  I mean, they have all promised to do it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=175.84s)]
*  So even if it's blank pieces of paper, to your point, why? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=177.56s)]
*  If it's blank pieces of paper, I'm certain they would release it right away. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=180.84s)]
*  Of course, they would have to explain why they were engaged in a propaganda exercise [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=185.76s)]
*  and why they've been saying things, including Pam Bondi, like, you know, the client list [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  is on my desk. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  And many of these people have gestured at the existence of a client list. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  So this is a vast public perception now without regard to ideological lines. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=200.55999999999997s)]
*  People believe that that client list is out there. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=205.92s)]
*  And look, this guy was a real child sex offender and they ran a child sex ring. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=208.2s)]
*  So, you know, we know that MAGA took that ball and ran all the way down the field with [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=215.48s)]
*  it and they're alleging satanic child sex rings and so on. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=220.28s)]
*  That has done huge damage to America's political and civic culture. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=224.28s)]
*  Let's get the truth out there so we can all see. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=228.12s)]
*  I mean, you know, I've not had a single Democrat tell me they're afraid of what's in there. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=231.44s)]
*  Maybe there are Democrats who are, you know, confidentially afraid in talking to the Trump [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=235.96s)]
*  administration. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=240.44s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=241.44s)]
*  Maybe there are some Republicans doing that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=243.04s)]
*  And we do know, look, why would Trump not want to release it at this point when he's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=244.94s)]
*  been demanding an open, complete, comprehensive accounting and release? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=249.06s)]
*  Either one, he's implicated and they don't want to doctor the tapes or at least doctor [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=253.78s)]
*  them any further because there is that mysterious one minute missing of the tape in the prison. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=259.46s)]
*  But so either he's implicated or there are other high ranking Republicans he's covering [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=267.86s)]
*  up for or there are people on there that he wants to use this as leverage against, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=272.44s)]
*  which we know is also a big, you know, MO for Donald Trump. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=277.9s)]
*  He would like to have the coercive leverage of possessing this arsenal of information [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=281.98s)]
*  around them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=287.18s)]
*  It'd be much better for everybody to come clean and let's vindicate the public interest [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=288.18s)]
*  here. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=292.7s)]
*  I'm going to be asking Chairman Jordan to call for a hearing where we subpoena the attorney [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=293.7s)]
*  Dan Bongino and Cash Patel to come in and tell us everything that we know, because this [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=299.84s)]
*  thing is really spinning out of control at this point. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=305.08s)]
*  And there's one way to put it to rest, which is to come clean as President Trump promised [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=307.94s)]
*  he would during the campaign. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=312.28s)]
*  There are strange alignments here as we've just started the show talking about. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=314.38s)]
*  Do you think Chairman Jordan is going to be open to doing that? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=318.05999999999995s)]
*  You do need them because they are in control, of course, of the House and the committee. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=320.84s)]
*  Do you think he will? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=324.46s)]
*  Well, I know that there are Republicans on the Judiciary Committee who are on the side [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=326.84s)]
*  of Cash Patel and Dan Bongino who've been saying all along that this evidence or, you [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  know, the evidence that was collected around this in several different criminal investigations [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=336.6s)]
*  must be made fully public. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=342.28s)]
*  I mean, this is an administration which calls itself the most transparent in history. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=344.44s)]
*  Whatever you think about the merits of that claim, they should try to live up to it here [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=349.24s)]
*  when they were the ones who were putting this on the public agenda. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=352.90000000000003s)]
*  And now doubt and skepticism are spreading across the country about what is on these [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=356.18s)]
*  tapes. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=362.7s)]
*  And we want to see them unfiltered, undocked, uncensored. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=364.42s)]
*  Just turn them over to us. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=368.86s)]
*  And I think that's something that Chairman Jordan could agree to. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=370.9s)]
*  And I certainly know there are Republicans in the House who feel that way. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=373.78000000000003s)]
*  Let me ask you one more question on this, because you reference tapes and there's this [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=378.26s)]
*  minute that's missing. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=381.24s)]
*  Is the tape and the minute missing where you think Trump could be implicated or a list [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=383.04s)]
*  of Epstein's cl- where do you think he could be implicated or you just don't know? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=387.04s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=393.16s)]
*  We're saying release the whole thing, which was what was promised. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=394.16s)]
*  Of course, Elon Musk in his fit of pique against Donald Trump when they had their quarrel said [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=396.72s)]
*  the reason it's not being released is because Trump is in the files. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=402.2s)]
*  He seemed to speak with authority the same way Dan Bongino spoke with authority before [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=408.54s)]
*  this happened and Cash Patel and even Pam Bondi herself. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=412.82s)]
*  They all seem to know things or know different pieces of it and it should be released to [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=417.36s)]
*  the public. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=422.3s)]
*  It should not be a political football. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=423.3s)]
*  We should just release it the way that if there had been a trial, had Mr. Epstein not [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=425.46s)]
*  died, all of this would have been public information. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=430.58s)]
*  And so every day that it goes on with them not releasing it looks more and more like [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=433.88s)]
*  a cover up. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=438.7s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Reskin, thank you for reminding everybody that you've been pushing for this [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=439.7s)]
*  long ago. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=444.06s)]
*  I should have said that too and thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=445.06s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=448.3s)]
*  My pleasure, Jen. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTvBfkUJDE&t=450.82s)]
