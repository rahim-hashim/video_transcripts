# Trump ‘can only sound so tone deaf for so long’ before voters catch on: NYT Reporter
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s)
*  I want to bring in the journalist who's behind that reporting, Shira Ovidai. She is the author [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Tech Friend newsletter at the Washington Post. Also with us, host of the Bullwork podcast [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=4.88s)]
*  and MSNBC political analyst, Tim Miller. On set with me, New York Times reporter and MSNBC [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=10.4s)]
*  contributor, Jeremy Peters. Shira Boy, your story caught my attention because we've talked a lot [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=15.92s)]
*  about what impact this might have on accessible fashion. But this is a real world example. You say [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=22.16s)]
*  that the math just doesn't work anymore for this brand's top selling sweater. Tell us about that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=29.44s)]
*  and what it means for shoppers. Yeah, I mean, I just picked one product out of the many millions [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=35.52s)]
*  that are likely to be affected by two twin policies out of the Trump administration. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=42.64s)]
*  One is this trade war and escalating tariffs with China that you've already talked about. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=48.24s)]
*  And the second was a change announced or implemented on Friday to eliminate a way that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=53.36s)]
*  lots of companies, including Quince, this internet retailer, have used to bring products to American's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=59.68s)]
*  door and basically bypass the traditional customs process and skip a lot of tariffs that products [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=66.16s)]
*  have owed. So Quince, I mean, look, everybody loves a deal. Let's start with that, right? We all want [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=73.36s)]
*  to think that we especially on cashmere, as Jeremy well knows, Quince even has on its page [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=79.28s)]
*  a breakdown of how their low costs compare to competitors like J. Crew or Everlane or Naked [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=85.52s)]
*  Cashmere. And I mean, that's appealing when you look and say, oh, our sweaters, 50 bucks, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=91.52s)]
*  and the other one is 275. What could this mean to a business like this that really is promoting the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=98.56s)]
*  fact that we're giving you a really good deal? Look, Americans love cheap stuff, right? And the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=106.8s)]
*  reality is all the companies that you just showed on the screen, right, they're all subject to the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  same tariffs that Quince is subject to. The difference is that Quince and retailers like it [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  built a business model on essentially skipping tariffs and bringing you products directly from [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=126.96s)]
*  Chinese factories in this new method that kind of sprung up just in the last six or seven years [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=133.2s)]
*  as a way to get around escalating tariffs on Chinese goods during the first Trump [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=138.72s)]
*  administration and then the Biden administration. And all of that basically collapsed in the last [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=143.76s)]
*  few months. And so what the natural result of all this is prices are going to go up for products [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  that Americans buy or companies are going to take a lot less in profits, including American companies [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=155.83999999999997s)]
*  or some combination of the two. Yeah, it's hard to see how you absorb 60 percent, Jeremy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=161.52s)]
*  This is a brand that basically says to people, we know you like the luxury brands. Maybe that's not [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  in your budget, so we can help you with this. But what does it say about the moment we're in? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=173.52s)]
*  Right. Well, it's a really good example of how our economy has really been [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=179.28s)]
*  flipped around and inefficient for a long time. Cashmere sweaters probably shouldn't cost $50, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=185.68s)]
*  but on the other hand, Taylor Swift tickets shouldn't cost $3,000. So you have to really [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  think about how the much work it's going to take to change the way this economy works, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=198.96s)]
*  to change consumer behavior, to retrain people into realizing, OK, maybe that $50 cashmere [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  sweater is not something that I need, nor is it something that I expect. Let me make an argument [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=212.24s)]
*  from a woman's perspective, if I might. First of all, maybe you're buying something that's cheaper [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=217.52s)]
*  but looks nice, knowing that this is something that is going to come and go. Maybe a cashmere [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=228.0s)]
*  sweater, crew neck, doesn't apply there. Or this is not a sweater I'm going to wear [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=234.4s)]
*  20 times this winter. This is something that I'm going to put on when I want to feel nice. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=240.4s)]
*  I'm going out somewhere nice. I'm going out to dinner. I've got my black cashmere sweater. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=244.8s)]
*  And that serves a purpose besides just being cheap, right? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=249.44s)]
*  I think the question is whether or not people are going to be able to get used to not having goods [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=252.96s)]
*  like that, a cashmere sweater, a flat-screen TV, what have you, that is so cheap, probably cheaper [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=258.56s)]
*  than it should be. And that's where this starts to really catch up to Republicans and Trump, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  because once people start to really resent having to pay more for certain things, they either take [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=272.4s)]
*  it out on the party in power, which is Republicans at the moment, or like the principle that's kind [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=278.96s)]
*  of underlying a lot of these tariffs, they change their behavior. And that's a much riskier, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=284.56s)]
*  long-term bet for this administration to be making. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=291.36s)]
*  And change is a hard thing, right? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  So, Tim, the veteran GOP strategist, Karl Rove, had a very specific descriptor for the president [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=296.0s)]
*  talking about how he's saying things like, children's toys, you can have fewer. Take a listen. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=302.56s)]
*  I thought it was really problematic when he said, well, you know what? Those little girls at [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=310.0s)]
*  Christmas, they don't need $30. They can do it too. And if they have to pay a couple more bucks [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=316.88s)]
*  for them, you know, okay, well, it sounds like Mr. Scrooge. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=320.8s)]
*  Well, I don't know how many girls get $30, $40 at Christmas, but Trump has been tripling down on [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  these doll comments. He is not backing off. And I wonder, as somebody who worked in a campaign, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=333.04s)]
*  how many ads that's going to go into, Tim, in the midterms? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=338.72s)]
*  Yeah, Karl Rove, welcome aboard here to the Trump critic ship. There's room for everybody. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=344.08s)]
*  I totally agree with you. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=351.2s)]
*  Scrooge, Grinch. Yeah, pick your descriptor. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=352.08s)]
*  Mr. Scrooge. The whole thing is kind of ridiculous, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=354.88s)]
*  Chris. I do think it will show up in ads. But Trump isn't even like offering a rationale [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  for why people should want to have fewer dolls or fewer sweaters or fewer pencils. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=365.28s)]
*  You know, like there's a kind of a leftist argument against overconsumption. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=369.92s)]
*  Maybe fewer cars, fewer homes, which might apply to some other people. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=376.0s)]
*  Sure. But he's not even really telling people why that they should sacrifice. Like they're [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=381.2s)]
*  sacrificing in service of nothing. Like his obsession with tariffs, I guess. Like he's not [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=385.84s)]
*  even making a coherent argument. Not to mention the absurdity of Donald Trump, like the king of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=389.84s)]
*  consumption, being the man to tell everybody else to calm down, you deserve less. So no, it's bad [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=393.92s)]
*  politics. I think that a lot of even the Republicans, as evidence for Karl Rove and [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=398.72s)]
*  Trey Gowdy were saying there, are hoping that he gets off of it. But there doesn't seem to be any [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=403.44000000000005s)]
*  evidence that he's going to be getting off of it anytime soon. So we've seen what's happened with [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=408.32000000000005s)]
*  the market, Jeremy, and already the Wall Street Journal is reporting that companies, including [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  big companies, are slowing or pausing hiring until they wait to see how all of this shakes out. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  But in spite of the president and his team, frankly, suggesting, oh, they're talking to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=422.8s)]
*  so many people, we have deals, we have deals that are very, very close, still no deals announced, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=427.12s)]
*  is what he said over the weekend closer to the truth. It's not going to be a traditional trade [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=434.08s)]
*  deal. It's just going to be Donald Trump saying, okay, this is where I'm settling on tariffs [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=439.76s)]
*  against you, country A, country B, country C. Right. Well, there's nothing traditional about [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=443.52s)]
*  this administration and there's nothing particularly traditional about what they consider to be the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=448.56s)]
*  truth. Right. So he is going to change policy and then tell us that this was the plan all along. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=453.44s)]
*  And if it doesn't go well, he's going to try to blame someone else for his policies failure. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=460.24s)]
*  And, you know, a certain number of voters will go along with that. The point that you raised [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=467.04s)]
*  about, you know, the $30 at Christmas, I mean, Tim should remember this really well. And this [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=474.56s)]
*  is an example of just how the traditional laws of political gravity don't apply to this guy. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=481.12s)]
*  Mitt Romney, remember, in 2012 was pilloried for saying that his wife had two Cadillacs. Right. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=488.08s)]
*  I don't know if this is ancient history by now, but you just remember how the Republican [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=495.04s)]
*  presidential candidate used to be held to such a high standard that Trump is just not. And when [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=498.96s)]
*  he talks, says he's ridiculous, out of touch things. Or you don't know how much a gallon of [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=505.2s)]
*  milk costs. Or you don't know how much a carton of eggs cost. Right. Or whatever he said yesterday [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=510.24s)]
*  about pencils, how, you know, you don't need 300 pencils. Maybe you only need three. These types [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=515.92s)]
*  of statements, I think they can only sound so tone deaf for so long before they start to matter [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=521.84s)]
*  to enough voters. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fE5t7_P0s&t=528.16s)]
