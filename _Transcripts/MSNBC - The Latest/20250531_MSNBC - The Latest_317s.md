# ‘No one knows what the end goal is’: Economics reporter reveals insider info on Trump’s tariffs
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c)
*  Major backlash today from European officials in response to President Trump's new promise [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=0.0s)]
*  to double tariffs on foreign steel to 50 percent, adding to the trade drama as talks with China [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=4.88s)]
*  hit a snag, causing frustration within the Trump administration. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=11.4s)]
*  Top economic adviser Kevin Hassett had this to say. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=15.36s)]
*  The word stalled, that stalled would mean that they are stopped, but I think we're absolutely [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=19.64s)]
*  frustrated that they're moving slower than we would like. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=23.68s)]
*  And I'm sure that that's what he was meaning to characterize. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=26.28s)]
*  He said they're a bit stalled. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=29.16s)]
*  A bit stalled, that's what I'm saying. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=30.76s)]
*  To be active. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=31.76s)]
*  A bit stalled, yes. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=32.76s)]
*  So you agree with that? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=33.76s)]
*  So it's not exactly stalled. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=34.76s)]
*  It's just moving slower than we would like. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=35.76s)]
*  Joining me now is Courtney Brown, economics reporter at Axios, covering the global economy [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=38.72s)]
*  and financial trends. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=42.36s)]
*  Welcome back to the show, Courtney. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=44.24s)]
*  So what's your immediate reaction to Trump's new steel tariffs? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=45.58s)]
*  And does it put the U.S. at a disadvantage in negotiations with other trading partners [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  like the EU? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=54.04s)]
*  I think the reaction on Wall Street is definitely, oh, no. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=57.4s)]
*  I think there was this idea that we were on an escalator going down, meaning deescalating [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=62.72s)]
*  on the trade front, and that was good news to Wall Street, to economists. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=70.32s)]
*  They were happy to see the tensions were deescalating. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=76.46s)]
*  In the past week or so, it seems like we're back going up on that escalator and tensions [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  are intensifying. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=87.44s)]
*  And this latest threat of doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum, I think there's concerns [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=90.0s)]
*  that where is the ceiling? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=96.48s)]
*  Where does the administration stop? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=99.44s)]
*  Does it go to 100 from here? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=101.16s)]
*  And what does the end goal look like? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  And do these tariffs come off? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=107.56s)]
*  If a trade deal is not, I think these are the big questions right now that everyone [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=109.68s)]
*  is grappling with. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=114.92s)]
*  And the president has repeatedly promised his tariffs will not hurt the American people. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=116.84s)]
*  Instead, he has said they're going to create more jobs. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  Take a listen to this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  We're going to bring it from 25 percent to 50 percent, the tariffs on steel, into the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=126.64000000000001s)]
*  America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=132.84s)]
*  There will be no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever, and every U.S. steel worker will [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=141.96s)]
*  soon receive a well-deserved $5,000 bonus. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=147.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=152.04s)]
*  Will U.S. workers really be spared from any negative impact, get that $5,000 bonus? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=153.76s)]
*  What about businesses overall? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  We have to think about which sector of the economy that we are talking about here. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=164.4s)]
*  Is this threat to raise tariffs to 50 percent? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  Is that going to create jobs in a very small sector? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=173.88000000000002s)]
*  Perhaps. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  What about the aggregate, I think, is the big question. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  Our economy has been a service sector economy for decades. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=185.2s)]
*  We are not the manufacturing economy that President Trump seems to want to create. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=191.48s)]
*  If President Trump wants to reorient the American economy to be more affiliated with manufacturing, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=198.88s)]
*  we're talking about a wholesale change in the foundation of the U.S. economy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=207.92s)]
*  There's going to be pain to make that change come to fruition. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=213.84s)]
*  I think how far does he want to go to revive the U.S. manufacturing sector? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=219.64s)]
*  It's going to be painful for workers in other sectors that are not so affiliated with manufacturing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  Can you give me a ballpark of the goals that President Trump is trying to accomplish, how long that would take? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=238.56s)]
*  No, I can't give you a ballpark. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  Trust me, Alex, I feel your frustration because I love numbers. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=250.04s)]
*  But when I talk to my sources, they are so hesitant to give me any numbers because no one knows what the end goal is. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=254.72s)]
*  We aren't sure whether the new baseline for tariffs is 10 percent. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  Is that the new normal going forward? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  Is it 25 percent? Is it 50 percent? Does it change based on the quarter? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  I think there's a lot of uncertainty. I know you probably hear this a lot. I hear it a lot. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=276.16s)]
*  There's so much uncertainty on Wall Street right now with respect to what does the economy look like next month, let alone next year. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  Courtney Brown, we'll have you back. Lots of questions coming your way, that's for sure. Thank you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dj97RzNf_c&t=291.48s)]
