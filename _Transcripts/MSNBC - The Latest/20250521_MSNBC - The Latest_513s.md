# 'What is our policy?': House Democrat set to grill Secretary Rubio on Middle East
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s)
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio was on Capitol Hill yesterday for a hearing on the State [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=0.0s)]
*  Department's budget request. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=4.68s)]
*  Some of his former colleagues used that setting to criticize the Trump administration's foreign [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=6.8s)]
*  policy and Rubio's central role in it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  One of them, Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who accused Rubio of abandoning [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=16.68s)]
*  his principles, which led to this exchange. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  Like the McCarthy era witch hunts of the 1950s, your campaign of fear and repression [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=27.08s)]
*  is eating away at foundational values of our democracy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=32.379999999999995s)]
*  Back then it took one voice, Attorney Joseph Welch, to cut through the hysteria with a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=36.08s)]
*  simple question that marked the beginning of the end of that shameful era. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  He asked Senator McCarthy, have you no sense of decency? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  And I would ask you the same, Secretary Rubio, but you have shown, through your words and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=48.56s)]
*  your actions, what the answer is. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=53.76s)]
*  And I have to tell you directly and personally that I regret voting for you for Secretary [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=56.64s)]
*  of State. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=61.08s)]
*  Well, first of all, your regret for voting for me confirms I'm doing a good job. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=62.08s)]
*  In the case of El Salvador, absolutely, absolutely, we deported gang members, gang members, including [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=65.28s)]
*  the one you had a margarita with. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=71.2s)]
*  And that guy is a human trafficker, and that guy is a gang banger, and the evidence is [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  going to be clear in the days to come you're going to see who you want to do it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=78.16s)]
*  Senator, please, Secretary Rubio has the floor. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=81.0s)]
*  Chairman, he can't make unsubstantiated comments like that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=83.64s)]
*  Secretary Rubio has the floor. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=87.2s)]
*  You had your time. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=88.52s)]
*  Secretary Rubio should take that testimony to the federal court in the United States [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=89.52s)]
*  because he hasn't done it under oath. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=92.16s)]
*  We should note, of course, that the margaritas mentioned there were a set up by the El Salvadoran [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=94.84s)]
*  government. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=98.8s)]
*  Neither man had a sip. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=100.28s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=101.72s)]
*  He's a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which will hold its own hearing [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=104.88s)]
*  with Secretary Rubio at the top of the hour. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=109.12s)]
*  Secretary with the Senate yesterday, the House today. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=110.72s)]
*  Congressman, good to see you this morning. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=112.84s)]
*  So let's start right there with your reaction to that exchange and what you what you plan [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  to say to the secretary about his administration's foreign policy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=122.48s)]
*  No, thanks. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=126.36s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=127.36s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=128.36s)]
*  First, let me say condolences to Jerry Connolly's family. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=129.36s)]
*  Jerry was one of the nicest, funniest people up here in Congress. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=132.24s)]
*  It was an honor to serve with him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  It just continues to see that seem that cancer takes the best among us. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=138.48s)]
*  You know, turning to the Rubio stuff, I mean, I don't know. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=144.0s)]
*  I assume he's doing a terrible job as the National Archivist. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=147.28s)]
*  But you know, on as far as what's going on at the State Department and a foreign policy, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=151.68s)]
*  right, my questions today are going to focus on the Middle East. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=156.12s)]
*  It seems that there is all sorts of mixed messages coming out of the Vance camp, the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=159.48s)]
*  Witkoff camp, the Trump camp, the Marco Rubio camp. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=164.76s)]
*  And so I'm going to try to figure out what what is our policy right now in the Middle [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=169.92s)]
*  East, Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=173.2s)]
*  What's going on in Gaza? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=176.28s)]
*  The situation are we are we renegotiating with Iran as far as letting them keep uranium? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=178.48s)]
*  That's the JCPOA by a different name. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  And so, look, I think what you saw yesterday is frustration because they served with Marco, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  the secretary has a long record up here and they're seeing a difference between the positions [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=194.32s)]
*  he took as a senator and the positions he took is taking as secretary. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  That that being said, look, when you take a job for somebody else and the president, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=203.0s)]
*  you have to take their positions. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=207.56s)]
*  But I think that's frustrating for the senators. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=209.0s)]
*  Congressman, you just laid out the swirl of storylines and crises happening in the Middle [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  East. Let's turn briefly to Ukraine, which I'm sure will also come up with the Secretary [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=216.44s)]
*  of State today. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  President Trump this week signaling that the U.S. may really pull back from the ceasefire [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=220.88s)]
*  talks, saying he's going to leave it to Ukraine and Russia to handle on their own, which many [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  have interpreted as a win for Moscow because you remove U.S. pressure, potential sanctions [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=231.08s)]
*  to get the deal done now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=237.32s)]
*  It allows Putin to continue the war indefinitely. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=239.2s)]
*  Yeah, very different than I'm going to end the war on day one, which is what we were [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  saying all over the country during the campaign. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=247.24s)]
*  Just goes to show you, right, what we say in campaign has no is not in reality. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=249.28s)]
*  I mean, listen, I think the administration is taking a step back because they can't get [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=254.8s)]
*  the win they want. Putin won't listen to the president. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think you've seen some of that frustration coming out of the White House in some of the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  reporting. And so, again, this is another foreign policy that we've gone back and forth [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=268.08s)]
*  on. Right. It started off very icy with Ukraine and seems they had a good meeting at the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=272.04s)]
*  Vatican. And now we're taking a step back because we're not getting the result that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=277.2s)]
*  we want. And so, yeah, it's unclear to me what our foreign policy is at the moment. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=282.4s)]
*  It changes by the week. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=288.4s)]
*  And these are the questions that I think Secretary Rubio is going to get in foreign affairs [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=290.56s)]
*  today. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=294.56s)]
*  Congressman, it's Lauren Leder. I did want to just turn back to Israel for a second. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=295.96s)]
*  And it was it's been obviously notable that the president didn't meet with Netanyahu on [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=299.2s)]
*  his Middle East trip. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  What's your sense of what the latest is with any ongoing discussions of the last hostages? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, Witkoff secured the release of, you know, one American, one American Israeli [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=310.68s)]
*  citizen, but it's far from the 50 plus that are still held in captivity. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=317.68s)]
*  Do you plan to ask the secretary about the ongoing hostages and how the administration [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=322.20000000000005s)]
*  is going to handle it? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  I do. And that was a wonderfully framed question. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=328.36s)]
*  And exactly what I want to hear from the secretary again, there's a lot of rhetoric of, you [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=332.12s)]
*  know, we're going to end this as soon as we get in the administration. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=336.96s)]
*  And it seems we're not any closer to that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  Obviously, we got to get the hostages out. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=341.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm happy to see that they're getting food in, you know, getting that into Gaza. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=343.56s)]
*  I think that's important. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=349.52s)]
*  I think you can defeat Hamas and, you know, feed children that Hamas is starving. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=351.56s)]
*  And so I think you can do both of those things. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=357.68s)]
*  But obviously, we want to see an end to the situation in Gaza, but not without the hostages [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=359.6s)]
*  getting out, not without the eradication of Hamas. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=364.12s)]
*  And of course, we're in this conundrum where, you know, Jordan and Egypt, you know, they [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=366.64s)]
*  don't want to they don't want to go in there and have a peacekeeping force or accept people [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=371.16s)]
*  from this area. You don't want to see the Qataris and the Saudis and the Emiratis. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  They don't want to do it. They don't want to put a peacekeeping force. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=379.0s)]
*  But no one wants Israel to do it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  And this is the conundrum. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=382.8s)]
*  The world doesn't want to step up and help, but they don't want Israel to do it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=383.8s)]
*  But so Israel has no choice but to do it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=387.12s)]
*  But, you know, obviously, we want to get the hostages out as fast as possible. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=390.6s)]
*  Congressman, lastly, I want to turn to news out of your home state. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=394.88s)]
*  There's going to be a governor's race there in Florida. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=398.16s)]
*  Some speculation that you might be interested. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  Please feel free to weigh in on that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=402.84000000000003s)]
*  But also some talk we're just getting now about former congressman, your former colleague, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=403.88s)]
*  Matt Gates, suggesting that he on the Republican side might jump in as well. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=414.0s)]
*  Well, obviously, I don't know anything about that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=415.0s)]
*  Matt now has a show on own. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=417.92s)]
*  President Trump has endorsed Byron Donald's. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=420.56s)]
*  I think, you know, based on what I'm seeing up here in Congress, doing anything against [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=423.52s)]
*  what President Trump wants seems to be virtually impossible in the Republican Party. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=427.68s)]
*  And so I can't imagine a primary where you have other Republicans running against [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=433.16s)]
*  Donald Trump's choice. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQjjhMp16s&t=438.04s)]
