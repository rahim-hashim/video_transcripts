# Hayes: We are more powerful than ‘one petty, addled man’—and Trump knows it
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk)
*  Good evening from New York, I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=0.0s)]
*  The Trump administration is trying to put Harvard University, the nation's oldest college, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=2.24s)]
*  out of business. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=7.68s)]
*  Today, we learned the White House is set to pull all the remaining federal funding that [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=8.68s)]
*  flows through the school, that's about $100 million, according to estimates. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=13.52s)]
*  That is in addition to the billions of dollars in research funding, including extremely crucial [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  biomedical research, the administration has already frozen at the university. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=23.32s)]
*  And of course, last week, the White House halted Harvard's ability to enroll international [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=28.28s)]
*  students, which the New York Times reports could impact about 25% of the student body. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=32.56s)]
*  Here's the thing, people all over the world desperately want to come to the U.S. to study [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=39.04s)]
*  because this country has for decades now offered the gold standard in terms of higher education [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=43.44s)]
*  globally. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  It's one area of just genuine American exceptionalism. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  And so international students are a huge boon to American universities and to the American [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=53.56s)]
*  students at those universities and all the economic activity around it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=58.36s)]
*  One study showed that about a million international students at American colleges and universities [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  contributed more than $43 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2023 and 2024 academic [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=67.12s)]
*  year. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=73.48s)]
*  You know, all those complaints you hear from Donald Trump and lots of people about our [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=74.48s)]
*  trade deficit with China, right? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  We buy everything from us. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  They buy nothing from us. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=81.64s)]
*  Well, one place that we have an enormous trade surplus with the rest of the world is in higher [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  ed. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=90.16s)]
*  But no one in the Trump administration actually cares about that or any of this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=91.16s)]
*  This is all just punishment against the university after it rejected the White House's demand [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=95.16s)]
*  to install third party auditors, kind of ideological like party apparatchik minders, to quote those [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=101.16s)]
*  programs and departments that most fuel anti-Semitic harassment or reflect ideological capture. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=109.16s)]
*  Think about that phrase. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=116.16s)]
*  Now, to be clear, anti-Semitism is a real and pernicious problem in America. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=118.16s)]
*  But by now it is painfully obvious that it is just a convenient rhetorical weapon for [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=123.16s)]
*  Trump and his allies to gain full control of universities. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=128.16s)]
*  I mean, think about that phrase, ideological capture. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=130.16s)]
*  That can mean anything. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=133.16s)]
*  We want to control what your ideology is. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=134.16s)]
*  They want to rewrite the school's curriculum in a way that is favorable and deferential [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=137.16s)]
*  to Trump and his worldview. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=142.16s)]
*  Donald Trump wants the most powerful and legendary institution in higher education in this country, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=144.16s)]
*  arguably in the world, to bend the knee to his whims and become a kind of controlled [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=150.16s)]
*  asset of MAGA. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=156.16s)]
*  That is the goal here. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=157.16s)]
*  And yes, let's be clear. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=160.16s)]
*  It's pretty hard to root for an elite institution like Harvard, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=162.16s)]
*  With a $53 billion endowment? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=167.16s)]
*  But this attack on the university isn't really about Harvard at all, qua Harvard, and it [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=169.16s)]
*  isn't happening in a vacuum. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=175.16s)]
*  It is the latest escalation in the administration's ongoing day-by-day battle, and this is going [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=177.16s)]
*  to sound hyperbolic, but I really believe it, to destroy all independent sources of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=183.16s)]
*  knowledge and fact-finding in our free and open society. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=188.16s)]
*  As writer Adam Serba put it in his latest piece of The Atlantic, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=194.16s)]
*  By destroying knowledge, Trumpists seek to make the country more amenable to their political [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=197.16s)]
*  domination and to prevent meaningful democratic checks on their behavior. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=201.16s)]
*  Their victory, though, would do much more than that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=205.16s)]
*  It would annihilate some of the most effective systems for aggregating, accumulating, and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=208.16s)]
*  applying human knowledge that have ever existed. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=212.16s)]
*  Without those systems, America could find itself plunged into a new dark age. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=216.16s)]
*  To that end, we are seeing the administration run this playbook towards, again, any independent [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=221.16s)]
*  source of authority. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=225.16s)]
*  The White House has already pulled $400 million in federal grants for Columbia University, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=227.16s)]
*  for example. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=231.16s)]
*  It might try to claw back even more money this week after announcing trumped-up charges [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=232.16s)]
*  of civil rights violations against the school stemming from campus protests about Israel's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=236.16s)]
*  war on Gaza. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=240.16s)]
*  In a new piece from The New Yorker, Jelani Cobb, the dean of Columbia's journalism school, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=242.16s)]
*  quotes one expert who taught at both Columbia and Harvard as saying, quote, I've studied [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=246.16s)]
*  McCarthyism's impact on higher education for 50 years. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=250.16s)]
*  What's happening now is worse. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=254.16s)]
*  Cobb adds, quote, the biggest mistake that some universities have made in responding [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  to the White House has been to presume it is operating in good faith. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  It is not. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  But it's not just attacks on higher education. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  Everywhere you look, Trump and his administration is targeting independent sources of authority [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  that could challenge Trump's actions, that could lead to a pluralistic society with contested [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=276.16s)]
*  views, right? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=282.16s)]
*  In addition to day-by-day eviscerating the U.S.'s best in the world biomedical research, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=284.16s)]
*  the administration is also undermining existing hard-won knowledge about public health. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=290.16s)]
*  Today, without citing new evidence or studies, which is key, Health and Human Services Secretary [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=296.16s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. apparently overrode his own vaccine advisory committee of experts, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=303.16s)]
*  right, and announced the government would no longer recommend annual COVID boosters [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=308.16s)]
*  for pregnant women and healthy children. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=313.16s)]
*  I couldn't be more pleased to announce that as of today, the COVID vaccine for healthy [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=316.16s)]
*  children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=321.16s)]
*  schedule. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=328.16s)]
*  Last year, the Biden administration urged healthy children to get yet another COVID [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=330.16s)]
*  shot, despite the lack of any political data, to support the repeat booster strategy in [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=334.16s)]
*  children. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=340.16s)]
*  That ends today. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=341.16s)]
*  It's common sense, and it's good science. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=342.16s)]
*  There's no evidence healthy kids need it today. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=345.16s)]
*  That's just not true. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=349.16s)]
*  There is quite a bit of evidence, including evidence published by the FDA last year. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=350.16s)]
*  But they aren't finished with their attacks on public health. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=355.16s)]
*  In a podcast appearance released today, R.F.K. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=358.16s)]
*  Jr. threatened to block government scientists from publishing their research in top medical [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=360.16s)]
*  journals like the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=366.16s)]
*  I mean, again, think about this sort of in context holistically. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=370.16s)]
*  In addition to the moves against public health and schools and higher education, we're also [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=373.16s)]
*  seeing this escalation day by day of Trump's attacks on us, news media, probably best exemplified [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=379.16s)]
*  by the president's $20 billion lawsuit against CBS News over an interview 60 Minutes held [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=385.16s)]
*  with then-candidate Kamala Harris. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=390.16s)]
*  First Amendment experts call the lawsuit meritless, but Paramount, which owns CBS, is already [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=392.16s)]
*  in settlement negotiation. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=398.16s)]
*  In response, President and CEO of CBS News, Wendy McMahon, resigned, as did the executive [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=399.16s)]
*  producer of 60 Minutes, Bill Owens. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=404.16s)]
*  Earlier this month, journalist Scott Pelley, who has been at 60 Minutes for more than two [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=406.16s)]
*  decades, delivered this warning at a recent commencement address for graduating students [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=410.16s)]
*  at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=415.16s)]
*  Why attack universities? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=418.16s)]
*  Why attack journalism? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=423.16s)]
*  Because ignorance works for power. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=428.16s)]
*  First, make the truth seekers live in fear. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=434.16s)]
*  Sue the journalists and their companies for nothing. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=438.16s)]
*  Then, send masked agents to abduct a college student who wrote an editorial in her college paper [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=444.16s)]
*  defending Palestinian rights and send her to a prison in Louisiana charged with nothing. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=453.16s)]
*  Then move to destroy the law firms that stand up for the rights of others. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=463.16s)]
*  With that done, power can rewrite history. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=475.16s)]
*  As you can see there, Pelley, to his great credit, is not cowed. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=480.16s)]
*  And it's true that many aren't. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=483.16s)]
*  Not every outlet is capitulating to Trump. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=485.16s)]
*  In fact, today, National Public Radio announced it is suing Trump over his attempts to essentially [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=487.16s)]
*  annihilate the organization, gut funding for the independent outlet through an executive order. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=492.16s)]
*  And we're seeing this type of resistance everywhere, sometimes in sort of unexpected areas. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=498.16s)]
*  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, I think he's a pretty conservative guy, as far as I can know. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=503.16s)]
*  He's a guy who was initially elevated to the job of Federal Reserve Chair by a guy named Donald Trump [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=508.16s)]
*  in his first term, is fighting the president's pressure campaign to remove him from his position, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=513.1600000000001s)]
*  calling on the next generation to preserve our democratic institutions again in another weekend commencement speech [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=519.16s)]
*  at Princeton University. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=524.16s)]
*  Here's the single most important thing for everyone to understand about this ongoing existential battle, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=527.16s)]
*  preserve our American birthright of a free and open society. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=533.16s)]
*  All these institutions and the people that power them and the vast sources of independent knowledge production [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-cCxwxI8Fk&t=537.16s)]
