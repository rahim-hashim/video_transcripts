# ‘Disgusting’: ‘No Kings’ organizers slam Trump’s threat of heavy force against protestors
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE)
*  with two dueling visions of America that will come into focus later today. Military artillery [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=0.0s)]
*  will roll through the streets of Washington, D.C. You see it on your screens now, to celebrate [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  the U.S. Army's 250th birthday, which also just happens to be President Trump's 79th birthday. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=10.56s)]
*  And across the country, more than 2,000 no-kings protests will take place in cities from coast [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=18.0s)]
*  to coast. The flagship rally starts later this morning in Philadelphia. It comes on [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=23.72s)]
*  the hills of a week where citizens across the country have already mobilized in opposition [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=29.16s)]
*  to President Trump's immigration raids. The coalition of no-kings organizers have a simple [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=34.24s)]
*  message. Quote, the flag doesn't belong to President Trump. It belongs to us. On June [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=40.88s)]
*  14th, we're showing up everywhere he isn't to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Joining [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=46.6s)]
*  us now, Leah Greenberg, co-founder of the group Indivisible that's helping organize [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=53.84s)]
*  no-kings protests, and Beverly Harvey, founder and group leader of Indivisible Kansas City [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=57.84s)]
*  and an organizer of the no-kings rally in Kansas City, Missouri. Beverly, I want to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  start with you because, you know, you're in a red state. I'm curious how hard or easy [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=68.12s)]
*  was it to get people to say they're going to stand up in this no-kings protest today? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=74.10000000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you what. We started this back in February. We had a big presentation right [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=79.92s)]
*  across the street at the community church. We had so many people show up, they had to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=85.28s)]
*  lock the door. So even though we're in a red state, there's a lot of people, whether they're [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  red, blue, whatever, that are showing up. Leah, Lee Shorten here. President Trump has [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=93.64s)]
*  called the protesters who are turning out to the no-kings and to other rallies around [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=100.88s)]
*  the country as paid protesters, troublemakers, part of a foreign invasion. Who are the men [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=106.24s)]
*  and women that you are seeing at these protests? I'll tell you what. They're every day. Oh, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=112.36s)]
*  sorry. Sorry. Those claims are just transparently ridiculous. The folks that we work with, they [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  are regular people all over this country who understand that politics and democracy, it's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=126.8s)]
*  too important to leave up to the politicians. They are nurses. They are teachers. They are [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=131.48s)]
*  IT technicians. And they know they had to do something because they are watching our [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  democracy under threat. They are watching our neighbors under attack. And they're standing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=138.96s)]
*  up and they're saying we're not going to stand for it. Hey, Beverly, I was just in your city [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  the other day on my book tour in Kansas City, great city. And as has been established, you [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=148.72s)]
*  are the founder of Indivisible Kansas City and doing the protest today. Listen to what [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=155.8s)]
*  President Trump had to say about what could happen to folks who show up here in Washington [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=161.44s)]
*  to protest the parade. And I'll talk to you about it on the other side. We're going to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  be celebrating big on Saturday. We're going to have a lot of, and if there's any protest [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  that wants to come out, they will be met with very big force. By the way, for those people [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=178.68s)]
*  that want to protest, they're going to be met with very big force. And I haven't even [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=182.84s)]
*  heard about a protest, but you know, this is people that hate our country, but they [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=186.56s)]
*  will be met with very heavy force. Now, of course, of course the president is talking [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=192.28s)]
*  about the military parade here in Washington today, but you are a protester and you're [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=197.6s)]
*  going to be among the thousands of people protesting around the country. What does it [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  mean to you or say to you that the president of the United States is saying that if you [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=208.42s)]
*  protest you will be met with quote heavy force? That is so disgusting to hear a president [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=212.92s)]
*  of the United States send out the military against its own people. This has never happened [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=220.92s)]
*  in the United States. It should never have happened in the United States. We've got 40, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  50, 60, 70, 80 year olds that are coming out to protest. You're going to send the military, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=233.83999999999997s)]
*  what, on grandma and grandpa? Really? I mean, it just doesn't, it makes no sense whatsoever. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  And I'll tell you, I'm a veteran and there's going to be a ton of veterans here and we [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=246.44s)]
*  are disgusted that the chief for the military is sending the military on us. Beverly, you [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  said you're a veteran. Tell us which branch of the military and where did you serve? I [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=260.16s)]
*  was in the U.S. Army back during the Vietnam era. I was a behavioral science specialist [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=266.4s)]
*  that counseled Vietnam vets when they came back. So I have served my country proudly [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=272.32s)]
*  and it is disgusting that Trump wants to put the military on the city streets against, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=278.48s)]
*  you know, protesters. We have a right, we have a constitutional right to protest. Well, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=286.68s)]
*  and I've heard that protesters are concerned about surveillance, frankly, as the Trump [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  administration overall is doing, ramping up for more surveillance on Americans, whether [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=298.86s)]
*  they're protesters or not. Leah, is that something that protesters are concerned about, that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=304.94s)]
*  they are being tracked if they participate in these protests? We've heard some of those [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  concerns and what I would say overall is that we're all really clear that we're in a climate [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=315.26s)]
*  of escalating retaliation and oppression. This is part of a broader agenda to crack [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=319.7s)]
*  down on any source of power who might stand in American society, who might stand against [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=324.41999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump. They believe that they can bully us all into submission. Today is about showing [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  them that they cannot do that, that we collectively are far more powerful than them, that real [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=334.73999999999995s)]
*  power is not staged in military theatrics in D.C. It rises up everywhere else in the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=340.14s)]
*  country. Beverly, one of the things that President Trump and other right-wing folks like to say [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=345.41999999999996s)]
*  when these protests crop up is that the folks doing them, quote, hate the country, right? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=351.97999999999996s)]
*  That they just, it doesn't make any sense that these folks would do this for anything [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=357.58s)]
*  but hating the country. You are a veteran. You have talked about it quite a bit. You're [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=361.56s)]
*  talking to all of these folks. Dispel the president and anyone else who thinks that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  you guys hate this country. Dispel them of that notion. Well, I'll tell you what, like [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=370.62s)]
*  I said, I served my country. We have a ton of veterans that are actually in our group [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=375.65999999999997s)]
*  and are in other groups. There's probably five or six other protests that are going [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=381.06s)]
*  to go on today. We love our country, and that's why we're protesting, because we want to save [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=384.9s)]
*  it from someone who wants to be a king. We're not going to have a king in this country or [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=390.06s)]
*  a monarch or a dictator. It's not going to happen. And we're going to stay out here and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=394.5s)]
*  protest and protest and protest until he's gone. Just recently, we had neo-Nazis here [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=399.78s)]
*  in Kansas City marching, and the governor didn't do anything about that, but yet he [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=407.56s)]
*  wants to send military troops on just regular American citizens. But he didn't do anything [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=412.44s)]
*  with the neo-Nazis that are here. So tell me, who really is for democracy? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=417.76s)]
*  And to Beverly's point, she's talking about, and this is from the Kansas City Star, the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=423.23999999999995s)]
*  headline, Missouri governor activates National Guard ahead of anti-Trump protests. It says [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=429.56s)]
*  Governor Kehoe activated the Missouri National Guard. The Republican governor singled out [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=435.24s)]
*  Kansas City, St. Louis, and Springfield and other affected communities in Missouri where [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=439.52s)]
*  events were occurring or could occur that create hazards for people and property beyond [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=444.28000000000003s)]
*  resources of local officials. Leah, I want to bring up NBC News decision desk poll that [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=450.64s)]
*  shows that 64% of those polled say they oppose using government funds for the military parade. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=458.96s)]
*  We see it there on the screen. So 64% of the American people don't want this to happen, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=466.76s)]
*  and yet it's happening. Talk about how Indivisible is going to sort of counter the president's [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=474.0s)]
*  notion that what he's doing is something that apparently he believes is the height of patriotism. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=482.12s)]
*  Well, you're absolutely right. People don't want this military parade. They don't want [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=488.08s)]
*  money that's being taken from veteran services to be used to throw Donald Trump a birthday party. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=493.32s)]
*  They do not want the National Guard in California. They are looking at all of this, and they are [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=498.2s)]
*  saying this is massive, shocking overreach by a guy who seems to think he's a king. The best way [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=502.28000000000003s)]
*  that we show that this is not supported, that Donald Trump's base is actually a lot more [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=509.24s)]
*  brittle than he thinks it is, is the mass widespread peaceful protest. And so that is really what today [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=514.36s)]
*  is all about. It's making sure that when people turn on their TV tomorrow and they hear the story [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=520.16s)]
*  of what's happening, what they see is Donald Trump throwing himself an empty, hollow birthday party, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=524.76s)]
*  and everyone else in the country, big tent of folks who are coming together collectively to say, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=530.16s)]
*  we don't do kings in America. This has to stop. Beverly, how have you seen the energy come back [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=535.32s)]
*  into the protest movement as the immigration crackdowns have started around the country? Has [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=543.12s)]
*  it charged the movement and brought people back in the fold after there was so much energy at the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=548.9200000000001s)]
*  beginning of Trump's first term, and then it waned off? And where do you see the movement right now? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=555.36s)]
*  Oh, it's increased tenfold. Like I said, when I started out, there was maybe one or two, maybe [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=560.32s)]
*  three different groups here in Kansas City. Now there's six, seven or eight different groups. So [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=568.72s)]
*  it's continuing to grow. You know, what they're doing, what ICE is doing, is awful. I mean, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=573.12s)]
*  they're taking American citizens and arresting them, taking them away from their families, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=579.32s)]
*  and nobody even knows where they are. I mean, this is unbelievable that this is happening in [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=584.8800000000001s)]
*  the United States. What is going on? Is there nobody, is there no Republicans that think this [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=589.6s)]
*  is just awful? I just don't understand that. Leah Greenberg and Beverly Harvey, thank you so much [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=595.76s)]
*  for being with us today. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=603.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7Dq1ebJJE&t=619.6s)]
