# 'Long time coming': ACLU lawyer on judge finding probable case to hold Trump admin in contempt
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE)
*  15 past the hour or more on our breaking coverage of a major legal standoff unfolding between [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=0.0s)]
*  the White House and the courts. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=4.68s)]
*  A federal judge now says he has found probable cause to hold the administration in criminal [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=5.88s)]
*  contempt over deportation flights it sent to El Salvador last month after the president [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  invoked the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  In his opinion, U.S. District Judge James Boesberg wrote, quote, the Constitution does [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders, especially by officials of a coordinate [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=22.36s)]
*  branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=29.88s)]
*  Joining us now is Lee Gelernt, lead attorney, arguing this case on behalf of the plaintiffs. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=32.48s)]
*  He is the deputy director of the Immigrants' Rights Project. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=37.44s)]
*  Lee, it's always a pleasure to see you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=41.36s)]
*  What do you make of the judges finding probable cause to hold the administration in criminal [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=42.76s)]
*  contempt? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=47.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is a long time coming. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=48.68s)]
*  I think a couple of points are worth noting. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=52.04s)]
*  has been very patient and given the government multiple, multiple opportunities to explain [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=55.92s)]
*  themselves. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=62.52s)]
*  And not only have they refused, but they're telling the judge he can't even look at information [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=63.52s)]
*  in chambers, even though he has top security clearance. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  So I think he finally reached a point where he felt like he needed to do something. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=71.72s)]
*  And I think what he's doing is essentially standing up for the courts, the role of the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=76.16s)]
*  in our democracy and saying we need to be a part of this and you can't defy my orders. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=81.16s)]
*  But I think the other part that's fundamental is he gave the government a choice. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=86.96s)]
*  He said either take the stand and explain yourself or bring these men back who were [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=90.96s)]
*  sent to a notorious Salvadoran prison, as you all have been talking about in the prior [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  segment with that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  And they were sent there without due process. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=101.92s)]
*  Let's be clear about that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  And that's where our overriding focus is. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=105.36s)]
*  Obviously, there are large issues about the role of the courts here. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=108.48s)]
*  But right now, we are laser focused on getting these men back who are sitting maybe perhaps [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=111.68s)]
*  for the rest of their lives in this brutal Salvadoran prison who were sent there again [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=116.48s)]
*  without any due process. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=121.28s)]
*  So we hope the government does the right thing and brings them back. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=123.04s)]
*  But it doesn't seem like that's going to happen. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=126.0s)]
*  They've already appealed within hours. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=127.68s)]
*  They appealed Judge Boasberg's order. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=129.68s)]
*  So, Lee, are you asking for ideally every single one of those hundreds of people that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=132.16s)]
*  were sent to El Salvador to be brought back to the United States for what? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=138.0s)]
*  So to have their due process hearings. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=144.0s)]
*  And I want to be clear about what the issues are. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=145.92s)]
*  First of all, we're saying that no one can be sent out of the country based on a wartime [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=149.04s)]
*  authority during peacetime. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=154.0s)]
*  This is a law that was meant only for military conflicts and has therefore only been used [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=155.28s)]
*  three times in our country's history, the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=160.0s)]
*  So no one can be sent out of the country, much less to the Salvadoran prison based on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=164.72s)]
*  this wartime authority. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=168.96s)]
*  But the second point we're saying is at a minimum, they have to have hearings and due [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=170.24s)]
*  process. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=174.4s)]
*  The evidence is now emerging that most, perhaps maybe almost all of them have no ties to this [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=175.44s)]
*  gang, but none of them had any ability to contest their inclusion under this wartime law. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=181.36s)]
*  So we are asking that they all be brought back and given due process and let the judicial [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=187.36s)]
*  process work its way through the courts. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  Lee, what level of responsibility or authority does the U.S. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=196.24s)]
*  government have with people who were already deported and who are already outside of the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=202.8s)]
*  United States? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  And in this case of the people that we're speaking about here, Lee, that are not American [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=211.52s)]
*  citizens when they were sent to another country? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=216.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'm glad you asked about that, because to begin with, the Supreme Court already [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  in this case has rejected the government's argument that they're not entitled to due [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=226.08s)]
*  process. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=230.08s)]
*  The Supreme Court squarely held that they're entitled to due process. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=230.8s)]
*  Now the government's arguing, well, they're in El Salvador, we can't do anything about it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=234.8s)]
*  Of course they can. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=238.8s)]
*  Everyone knows that they can bring them back if they want. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=239.84s)]
*  We're paying for that facility. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=242.8s)]
*  And these are Venezuelan men. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=245.04s)]
*  While Salvador has no connection to where they're holding them solely at the behest [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=246.4s)]
*  of the United States and we are paying for it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=251.2s)]
*  So I hope that if the court says they need to be brought back, the government will listen. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=253.84s)]
*  So there have been other instances in our history where people have been deported to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=258.8s)]
*  a country that is not a country of their birth. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=264.4s)]
*  And I'm thinking of what's happened, for example, with Venezuelans specifically when [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=267.12s)]
*  the Maduro regime has not accepted them at different times. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=272.16s)]
*  But this is not unusual. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  What is unusual is that they were placed in jails. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, just recently we were seeing cases in Panama when people were sent there who [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=280.8s)]
*  were not Panamanians by the US government. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=286.16s)]
*  And the Panamanians put them up in a hotel for a couple of days and then we haven't really [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  seen what happened to them. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=292.48s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  And so we are actually, the ACLU with our partners are suing over that as well because [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  they did not get screenings and were sent to Panama without any due process. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=300.24s)]
*  But here we have a situation where these individuals were sent to El Salvador again [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=304.56s)]
*  without any screening and we know that they're going to be potentially tortured. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=309.76s)]
*  So at a minimum, they have to be screened for torture. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=313.68s)]
*  And there's a very clear process if you're going to send someone to a third country. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  That process was not followed. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=321.04s)]
*  All due process was shed and they were sent there. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=323.04s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=326.24s)]
*  Sometimes people can be sent to a third country, but only after extensive process to make sure [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  they're not going to be in harm's way there and certainly not sent directly to a foreign prison. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  Are you sure that in the past there has been really that consistent and insistent process [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=337.84s)]
*  when they send people away? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=342.79999999999995s)]
*  I'm not so sure that that's the case. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=344.08s)]
*  Well, certainly not under the Trump administration. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=346.24s)]
*  And you're right, there have been instances like that, but they've been sort of isolated [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=348.4s)]
*  instances here. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=353.44s)]
*  There seems like a systematic attempt by the Trump administration to avoid all due process [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=354.16s)]
*  and send these individuals to where they may spend the rest of their lives. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=359.44s)]
*  And as you've pointed out, you know, many times in a brutal prison where torture is commonplace. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=362.88s)]
*  Well, Lee Glerd, I thank you very much. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=368.64s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=370.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zey718IBPRE&t=383.44s)]
