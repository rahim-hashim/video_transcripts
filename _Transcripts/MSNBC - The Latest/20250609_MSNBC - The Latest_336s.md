# 'Truce is back on track' in U.S.-China trade talks: Analyst
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag)
*  Joining me now is senior fellow at the Yale Law School's Paul Sy China Center Sam Sachs Sam. Welcome back to the show [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=0.0s)]
*  So Kevin has it there says this deals about to be closed. What does that mean? It seems impossible [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=6.58s)]
*  A trade deal would happen this quickly [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=12.92s)]
*  A truce is back on track [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Here's what happened the two sides met in Geneva less than a month ago [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  And then they quick whatever they agreed to and we can talk about whether that was substantive or not [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Quickly fell apart as the US unrolled new export controls on China's tech sector and China held up export controls on rare earths [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=29.44s)]
*  Now I think both sides desperately want a deal and they need it for economic reasons [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=38.2s)]
*  They need it for political reasons and the question is how deep will it go? Will this be a surface deal? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=43.52s)]
*  Will it just bring bring back stability or they really get at some of the challenging issues that have been vexing the relationship? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Okay, so Geneva being a few weeks ago, but the timeline leading up to this in-person meeting [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  Let's talk about that because just a few days prior to their phone call [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=61.56s)]
*  President Trump took to social media to voice his frustrations with President Xi saying he's extremely hard to make a deal with I mean [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=65.28s)]
*  Tomorrow's meeting do you see it as a de-escalation? What do you think will will have brought both sides to the table? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=74.04s)]
*  So I read Trump's post on truth social a bit differently to me it said I need a deal [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=81.56s)]
*  So please help me and also by Trump saying that she is a really hard deal maker [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=88.76s)]
*  He's trying to signal that if and when they do come to some kind of a deal [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=95.92s)]
*  It's because he only is the master deal maker that would be able to get she to come to the negotiating table [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=100.56s)]
*  So when I saw that post I said, aha, it's gonna happen [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=107.64s)]
*  So to your point one of the biggest points of contention has been the exchange of rare earth magnets of which China currently makes [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=112.28s)]
*  90% of the world's supply [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=120.44s)]
*  Will China be using this as a bargaining chip? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=122.32s)]
*  Beijing discovered that its controls on rare earths are a true choke point and I don't think the Trump [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=126.2s)]
*  Administration was it all prepared for the panic that would ensue when US automakers the defense industry [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  And more suddenly were caught in a lurch [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean we heard reports just a week ago that at a time when Trump is trying to reshore auto manufacturing [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  US automakers had been considering [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=152.12s)]
*  paradoxically moving their factory production to China just so that they could capture the rare earths they need and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=155.08s)]
*  Export them to the US as finally assembled goods [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=163.28s)]
*  So I think that this administration was completely caught off guard Beijing has real leverage with this choke point [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  Okay [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  There's another thing to consider here though because the US in recent weeks has cracked down on international students saying that it's going to begin [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=174.28s)]
*  revoking the visas of some Chinese students more than half of all international students enrolled here in US colleges and universities [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=181.88000000000002s)]
*  Came from India and China, so this has been another thorn in the relationship. Do you think it'll play into the negotiations? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=189.12s)]
*  It absolutely is being put forward as a negotiating tactic [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=196.8s)]
*  But this is yet another example where the Trump administration is shooting itself in the foot [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=200.78s)]
*  Not only the universities around the nation rely on the tuition payments of international students [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=206.52s)]
*  And a huge majority of those are coming from Chinese tuition they pay full tuition, right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  These are also the best and brightest from around the world look we want to outpace China in emerging technologies [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=217.92s)]
*  But our ability to attract top tier STEM students to our universities and research labs is the way to do that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=224.24s)]
*  So I think this is going to be part of a negotiating tactic. I would be very surprised if they stick to it [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=232.24s)]
*  So both President Trump and the officials close to him have hinted [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=239.2s)]
*  They are very close to ironing out a deal but with only a few weeks left in the 90-day tariff pause [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=243.76s)]
*  Do you think there's enough time for both sides to come out with a trade deal that everyone is happy with? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=249.72s)]
*  What we're likely to see at least initially is something that will kick allow us to kick the can down the road [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't think in 90 days [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=261.28s)]
*  They're going to resolve some of the really intractable issues like restructuring China's economy what happens with US export controls on China [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=263.36s)]
*  But what they're gonna do is probably carve out a path that will create some guardrails [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=271.88s)]
*  So the things don't fall off as they did before [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=277.2s)]
*  I could see a deal potentially down the road not necessarily in 90 days that involves large purchases from China of US [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=280.56s)]
*  Agricultural goods for example, but the thing to watch going forward and that's new is that now the Commerce Secretary [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=289.04s)]
*  Howard let Nick is part of the US negotiating team before it was just US [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=295.48s)]
*  TR Greer and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  Secretary Treasury Besant they added let Nick because that is a signal that export controls on the US side [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=302.88s)]
*  Will now be squarely on the negotiating table. This is something that Beijing has wanted for a very long time [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=309.64000000000004s)]
*  You [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2J5zDmLIag&t=330.6s)]
