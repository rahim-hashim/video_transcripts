# 'Her community is here': Father of college student facing deportation pleads for her release
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ)
*  A 19-year-old Georgia college student who was brought into this country as a four-year-old [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=0.0s)]
*  is facing deportation after she was pulled over for a traffic stop. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=5.2s)]
*  Police are now calling a mistake. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=9.92s)]
*  Jimena Arias-Cristobal was born in Mexico and has been living in the U.S. without authorization [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=11.72s)]
*  since she was a child. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=16.96s)]
*  She was arrested on May 5th by police in Dalton, Georgia, who accused her of making an improper [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=18.98s)]
*  turn and then finding out she was driving without a license. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=24.12s)]
*  Arias-Cristobal was then picked up by ICE officers and has been held in detention ever [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=27.88s)]
*  since. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=33.04s)]
*  Even though the Dalton Police Department dropped the traffic-related charges earlier this week, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=34.04s)]
*  said that it was a mistake that she wasn't the one who offended the law, DHS still says [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=40.12s)]
*  it's not going to back down. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=45.96s)]
*  Joining us now, Jimena's father, Jose Arias-Tovar, and their lawyer, Dustin Baxter. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=47.28s)]
*  Thank you for joining us, gentlemen. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=54.04s)]
*  Jose, I want to begin with you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=56.16s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  How's your daughter? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm doing pretty good, thank you, for this time. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm just waiting for my daughter. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=64.96s)]
*  She's in the Stuart Detention Center right now, and hopefully next week we can get her [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=67.52s)]
*  here at home. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=74.52s)]
*  Have you spoken to her? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=76.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=79.08s)]
*  This morning she called to my cell phone and she said it's okay. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=81.39999999999999s)]
*  She needs to wait until Tuesday, but she looks, she sounds good right now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=91.2s)]
*  That's good to hear. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=100.6s)]
*  Dustin, what's going to happen on Tuesday? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=101.6s)]
*  We have a bond hearing scheduled at immigration court. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=104.16s)]
*  We hope to get a judge to grant a bond because DHS has decided that they don't think that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=108.84s)]
*  she should be given a bond, which is why we have to now go before the judge for that bond [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=113.32s)]
*  hearing and request a bond so she can be released to her family. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  Part of the issue that I was curious about is, Jose, you were also in detention up until [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  a few days ago, again, pulled over for a traffic stop. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=124.64s)]
*  They found that you didn't have papers and they put you in detention. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=128.32s)]
*  How come you were able to be released on bond? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=132.12s)]
*  Well, my lawyer took my case and we proved that I'm not a dangerous person for the community. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=136.32000000000002s)]
*  My fault is driving with no driver license and we can prove that in the bond court. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=152.72s)]
*  They decided to give me a bond to get out and now I got a process and hopefully we can [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=162.4s)]
*  fix my immigration situation in the next few weeks. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=172.24s)]
*  So Dustin, does that give you hope that this is going to be the same process for Jimena? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=177.84s)]
*  Yes, that's correct. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=183.36s)]
*  The case is a little bit different, but it does give us hope. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=185.36s)]
*  We're also hopeful because she's been here for so long, she has no criminal record. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=192.32s)]
*  The only arrest that she had was a false arrest, which landed her unfortunately where she is now. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=196.48s)]
*  And she's not a flight risk. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=201.76s)]
*  She has the support of all of her community, she has the support of her family, and frankly, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=202.88s)]
*  if the judge were to release her on bond, she has nowhere to go but home. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=206.88s)]
*  It's not like she's this person of means who can then abscond and go hide in California [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=210.4s)]
*  and not be found by immigration. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=217.2s)]
*  So we have a lot of hope because Jose was granted bond, which is a great thing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=218.48s)]
*  We're glad to have Jose back with his family, that she will also be granted bond and be [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=222.32s)]
*  reunited with them as well. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=226.0s)]
*  Jose, tell us a little bit about her. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=228.4s)]
*  What's she like? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=230.4s)]
*  Well, she's a great daughter. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=231.92s)]
*  She's a great student and she's an athlete. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  She do like cross country and track. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=240.48s)]
*  So she got a big future in this country. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=245.6s)]
*  So I hope she can fix this situation and get a pretty good life here in the U.S. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=251.04s)]
*  You guys brought her here when she was four. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=263.36s)]
*  If DHS does deport her, where would she go? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=266.48s)]
*  Well, Mexico City. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  We are from Mexico City. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=274.64s)]
*  It's like Plan B, but we want to stay here in the U.S. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=277.2s)]
*  because she's never been in Mexico since she was four years old. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=284.32s)]
*  So her friends, her country, her community is here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=290.08s)]
*  It's the only thing she knows. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=298.32s)]
*  So I'm trying my best to keep her here in this community. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  What about her sisters who are American citizens? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  She's got two younger sisters who are American citizens, right? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=310.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=313.76s)]
*  Two beautiful girls, 12 years old and nine years old. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=315.84s)]
*  So would they have to come too? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=322.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=325.67999999999995s)]
*  We believe in the family. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  Always the family need to keep together. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=328.4s)]
*  So if Jimena need to go to Mexico, I think we need to go everybody to Mexico [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=331.2s)]
*  because I believe in the family and we need to work together to get a better future. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=338.0s)]
*  There are people who say that you broke the law and you shouldn't be here. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=346.08s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene is one of those people who's saying the law is the law. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=350.08s)]
*  She should have gotten her family should have tried to pursue a legal path to stay in this country. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=353.2s)]
*  Tell us, tell Marjorie Taylor Greene why you believe that you should stay, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  why you believe that you are your benefit, that you deserve to be here. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  I guess plead the case. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=371.12s)]
*  Excuse me, the phone call. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=374.32s)]
*  Can you ask me again, please? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=376.56s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=378.32s)]
*  I'm, I'm, I'm, tell the people who say you shouldn't be here. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=378.96s)]
*  What do you say to them? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=384.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, I can say, I know we brought some laws, immigration laws 15 years ago. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  I understand that part. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=402.0s)]
*  But when we come to this country, we learn to love this land. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=404.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful people, the American people. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  It's great, very smart people. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=415.44s)]
*  So we love this place. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  We love this community and we work together to build America. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=421.2s)]
*  We are good persons. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=426.8s)]
*  I'm a businessman. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=428.56s)]
*  My daughters are students. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=430.48s)]
*  I got a great wife and we believe in the, in the better future here. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=432.48s)]
*  So if the government and the community can give us a chance, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=441.12s)]
*  we can do the right things and build America together. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=449.76s)]
*  We are ready for that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=453.6s)]
*  And I know there's been a lot of people who have come out and speaking in your favor, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=455.44s)]
*  including Georgia State lawmaker, Casey Carpenter, saying he wrote a letter vouching for Jimena. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  He said there's been an uprising of heartbreak for the community because a lot of people felt [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=466.96s)]
*  like we're going to go after the hard criminals. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=471.52s)]
*  And unfortunately, good people are getting caught on the wash, caught in the wash on this issue. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=473.84s)]
*  Jose, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  And I'm happy to hear that Jimena is doing okay. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  I do hope you guys are reunited. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=485.28s)]
*  Again, thank you for being here. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=488.64s)]
*  And Dustin, thank you for joining us as well. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnbIvyGFJQ&t=489.92s)]
