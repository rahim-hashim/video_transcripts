Video Description: Since mid-March, the U.S. has been ramping up bombings on Houthi rebels in Yemen. In all, nearly 200 people – many civilians – have been killed by U.S. strikes since March 15th. As the Trump Administration guts foreign aid, NYTimes columnist Nicholas Kristof, who’s been covering the conflict for years, says, “We can't afford 12 cents a day to keep those kids alive, yet we are spending millions of dollars killing civilians for no obvious purpose.”

# ‘Enormous pain for no gain’: Trump admin ramps up bombing of Yemen
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E)
*  The Trump administration continued its bombing campaign against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=0.0s)]
*  last night, carrying out 13 airstrikes near the city of Hodeidah, Yemen, according to Houthi [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=4.08s)]
*  news agencies. Now, this comes just two days after 74 people were killed as a result of a different [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  U.S. airstrike on Yemen. That's according to the Houthi-run health ministry. That strike was here [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  at the Ras Issa oil point along the Red Sea. U.S. Central Command said it eliminated a source of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=21.04s)]
*  fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, but that the strike was, quote, not intended to harm the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=26.8s)]
*  people of Yemen, end quote. Nice sentiment, except it did. Al Jazeera reported that among the dead [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=31.68s)]
*  were port workers, truckers, and other civilians. Thursday's attack is only the latest in a series [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  of escalated attacks on the Houthis by the Trump administration. According to Yemen's ministry of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  health, U.S. strikes have killed at least 190 people, mostly civilians, since mid-March, when [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=49.28s)]
*  Donald Trump first authorized military action against the rebel group for disrupting shipping [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=55.52s)]
*  routes in the Red Sea. Remember when the national security adviser Mike Walz, defense secretary Pete [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  Hegseth, and vice president JD Vance were discussing U.S. airstrikes in a signal group chat, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=65.36s)]
*  and then they accidentally added a journalist from the Atlantic? Well, that strike took place [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=71.84s)]
*  on March 15th in Yemen. That major security breach may have been the scandal, but it undercut a much [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  more gruesome story. Those particular U.S. strikes killed at least 53 people in a country with which [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=81.92s)]
*  we are not fighting a war. It's worth noting that the Biden administration also conducted airstrikes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  against Houthi rebels starting in January of 2024. Houthis had been attacking trading ships to pull [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  Israeli forces away from Gaza, but Pentagon officials now tell the publication Military.com [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  that there hasn't been a Houthi attack on shipping routes in the Red Sea for months. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=105.76s)]
*  Since before Donald Trump took office, although they did launch retaliatory strikes [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=110.56s)]
*  after the March 15th attack, but since then the U.S. military has continued this open-ended [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=114.64s)]
*  campaign. Houthis have, however, launched missiles at Israel, although they were intercepted by the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=120.48s)]
*  Israeli military. They've also had success shooting down many of the drones that the United States has [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=125.84s)]
*  sent their way. Here's a video from the Houthis of what they say is a downed MQ-9 Reaper drone. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=130.56s)]
*  NBC News confirms the Houthi rebels have downed five drones since Trump's military campaign, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=138.4s)]
*  each of which cost the U.S. $30 million apiece. Again, country we're not at war with. All the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  while Yemen is experiencing and has been experiencing for a very long time one of the largest humanitarian [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=150.4s)]
*  crises in the world. Now that's as a result of a 10-year-long civil war. Nearly half the country's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=156.16s)]
*  population, about 18 million people, are in dire need of humanitarian assistance, according to the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=163.04s)]
*  UN Refugee Agency. 17 million Yemenis face acute food insecurity. More than 80 percent of the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=168.4s)]
*  country lives below the poverty line, and about four and a half million have been internally [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  displaced. Now it's important to remember the U.S. has been complicit in this. With American support, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=181.44s)]
*  Saudi Arabia conducted a bombing campaign against the Houthis. U.S. manufactured bombs were dropped [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  on civilian infrastructure with U.S. knowledge, and people were, fair to say, indiscriminately [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=194.24s)]
*  killed. This dates all the way back to 2015. Joining me is somebody who knows a lot about this, Nicholas [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  Kristof. He's a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the New York Times. He's the author of the book [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=206.56s)]
*  Chasing Hope, A Reporter's Life. Nick, the reason I want to talk to you about this, this is not a judgment [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  on whether or not Americans should be fighting with Houthi rebels. It's the fact that Yemen has [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=215.28s)]
*  become more than just a punchline. It's not a people. It's not a thing. It's just a thing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=221.04s)]
*  You just target Yemen, and that's okay. We're not really thinking about the fact that regular people [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=225.44s)]
*  live there who are just trying to go about their lives, and we do not seem to be taking, and have [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=230.96s)]
*  not been taking for a decade, a particularly discriminant approach to who we're targeting and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=235.36s)]
*  who we're killing. Yeah, I mean, you're right. There are a few countries that over the last 10 [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=240.08s)]
*  years have suffered as much in terms of ordinary civilians. I mean, years ago, I would see children [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=246.32000000000002s)]
*  just emaciated. They're starving to death, literally, and that has continued and intensified, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=253.68s)]
*  and it intensifies in the face of our bombing. And, Ali, what I keep thinking is that the Trump [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=260.72s)]
*  administration is cutting aid money, you know, 12 cents per child per day to save kids who are [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=267.92s)]
*  dependent on ARVs to keep HIV away. We can't afford 12 cents a day to keep those kids alive, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=276.56s)]
*  yet we are spending millions of dollars killing civilians for no obvious purpose in Yemen. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  You mentioned those Reaper drones, the MQ-9 Reaper drones costing $33 million each that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=292.32s)]
*  they've shot down since the beginning, since October 7, 23, when the Israel Hamas War began. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=300.56s)]
*  They've apparently shot down more than 16 of them, costing half a billion dollars, and that's just in [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=308.88s)]
*  the drones they've shot down. And so I look at Yemen, and I see this immense suffering that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=316.24s)]
*  we are amplifying. I don't see any strategic gain. The Red Sea is not safer now. If anything, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=321.36s)]
*  it's maybe less safe. The Houthis may be more popular because they're perceived as taking on [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=327.6s)]
*  a foreign attacker. And, you know, it's absolutely true that the Houthis are repressive. They're [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=335.52s)]
*  misogynists. They've closed down traffic in the Red Sea, but this is not helping, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=340.88s)]
*  and it's just a waste of lives and money. So part of the problem is whether you like or hate the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=348.4s)]
*  Houthis or the Taliban or ISIS or Hamas, all of which there are reasons to want gone from all [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  pictures and arguments that they're bad for everybody over whom they govern, very few [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=361.68s)]
*  Western journalists do what you do. Whether it's Sudan or Yemen or places like this, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=368.72s)]
*  you've gone there and you've seen real people. The failure to humanize people allows these things [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  to happen, right? It allows us to say, I don't know what goes on in Yemen, must just be bad. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=383.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's historically been true. You know, we were willing to [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  to bomb Hanoi because we didn't envision the families that were being killed there. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  So what happened at Mai Le with the massacre there? And, you know, it's been true all around [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=402.88s)]
*  the world. We didn't intervene in Rwanda in the genocide because it was hard for us to put [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=409.12s)]
*  ourselves in the shoes of Rwandans. And right now, I think you're exactly right that we continue to [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=413.76s)]
*  see the bombing of Yemen through this, you know, somehow this sort of strategic lens without [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=420.24s)]
*  understanding that there are families there that are weeping over their children and that there [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=427.6s)]
*  are more children who were starving to death. And again, you know, for what the Saudis, with help of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=431.92s)]
*  American intelligence, spent seven years bombing Yemen for no obvious gain. And the Biden [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=439.52s)]
*  administration did some and now the Trump administration is bombing daily. We're [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=447.92s)]
*  inflicting enormous pain for no gain at enormous expense, Ali. Well, Nick, again, thank you for [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=452.56s)]
*  always being that guy who goes there to cover stories that no one would even know in some cases [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=459.76s)]
*  need covering. You are that person and you make us smarter for it. So thank you. Nick Christoph is [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  a columnist for the New York Times. He's the author of the book Chasing Hope, a reporter's life. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3WzqrwPa9E&t=469.20000000000005s)]
