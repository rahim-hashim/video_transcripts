# Rep. Garcia on Trump deportations: 'Everyone has a right to due process'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk)
*  Joining me now is Congressman Robert Garcia of California, a member of the House Oversight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=0.0s)]
*  and Homeland Security Committees. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=5.54s)]
*  Congressman as always, thank you very much for coming to the Saturday show. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  So tell me, what did you learn from your visit to El Salvador? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=11.78s)]
*  Well, a couple of things. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=15.0s)]
*  I think the most important thing, and we're of course there because Donald Trump is defying [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=16.42s)]
*  a 9-0 unanimous Supreme Court decision to bring back Gilmore Garcia back to the United [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=20.84s)]
*  States and lower courts, of course. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=26.6s)]
*  We went there to inquire, was the facilitation process, had that begun as ordered by the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=29.0s)]
*  court? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=34.24s)]
*  Could we see Gilmore Garcia? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=35.24s)]
*  And what we learned directly from the embassy and the U.S. ambassador is that they have [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=36.24s)]
*  not been directed in any way to begin the facilitation or return of Gilmore Garcia back to the U.S. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=39.64s)]
*  And so even though there's a court order, the embassy on the ground is actually not [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=46.24s)]
*  doing any of that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=49.42s)]
*  They did not have a chance to see him. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=50.8s)]
*  Only Republicans are now being allowed to have official code else to go to the prisons [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=52.56s)]
*  in El Salvador. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=57.1s)]
*  They're denying Democrats from doing so. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=58.2s)]
*  We went anyway. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=60.14s)]
*  And of course, we're also inquiring about other people there that had no due process, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=61.14s)]
*  like Andrew Romero and others that deserve a chance to be in front of a judge. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=64.58s)]
*  And I'm going to ask you about Andre Hernandez Romero in a second. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=68.26s)]
*  Let me read you something that President Trump said in his interview with Time magazine about [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=72.18s)]
*  whether Abrego Garcia deserves his day in court. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=76.42s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=79.5s)]
*  That's not my determination. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=81.1s)]
*  It's something that frankly bringing him back and retrying him wouldn't bother me. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=82.9s)]
*  But I leave that up to my lawyer. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=87.26s)]
*  You could bring him back and retry him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=89.46000000000001s)]
*  But I leave that decision to the lawyers. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=91.76s)]
*  At this moment, they just don't want to do that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=94.18s)]
*  They say we're in total compliance with the Supreme Court. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=97.22000000000001s)]
*  One, Congressman, that last line is a lie. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=101.26s)]
*  But two, what the president says here, I think, is exhibit A and what you and your fellow [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=104.22s)]
*  Democrats have been arguing from moment one, which is this is a constitutional crisis. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  The president of the United States is the chief constitutional officer of this country. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=117.22s)]
*  And he right here in this quote is saying there's nothing he can do. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=121.33999999999999s)]
*  I mean, completely shameful and dangerous. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=126.33999999999999s)]
*  I mean, we're in a moment right now where the president is defying the judicial branch [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=128.85999999999999s)]
*  of government. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=133.29999999999998s)]
*  We have a separation of powers in this country. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  You don't get to pick and choose what parts of the Constitution you actually want to follow. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=136.18s)]
*  This is the president of the United States. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=140.74s)]
*  And if the Supreme Court is ordering that someone gets returned back to our country, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=142.89999999999998s)]
*  he has to follow those orders and that ruling. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=147.89999999999998s)]
*  And why this case is so important is that we cannot allow Donald Trump to cross this [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=151.26s)]
*  line. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=156.7s)]
*  A president has not defied the Supreme Court in this way, and we cannot allow it to happen [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=157.7s)]
*  at this moment, which is why every single American should be very concerned that due [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=162.89999999999998s)]
*  process is under attack, something that is, of course, we know, vital to the Constitution [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=166.89999999999998s)]
*  and that is given to everyone in this country, whether they're a citizen or a non-citizen. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=172.18s)]
*  Everyone has a right to due process. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  Let me get your view on the arrest of Judge Duggan there in Milwaukee yesterday. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=179.1s)]
*  How does that fit in with your overall concerns? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=184.62s)]
*  This is very concerning. You're arresting now judges. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=187.58s)]
*  You are cutting deals with big law firms to not sue the federal government or the administration [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=190.54s)]
*  or do pro bono work for Donald Trump. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=195.38s)]
*  You are eliminating due process for people in this country. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=198.06s)]
*  For now, non-citizens and U.S. citizens, as we have learned. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=201.06s)]
*  So the full on attack of the judiciary system in this country has begun. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=205.14s)]
*  It's a constitutional crisis. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=211.54s)]
*  We should be taking it as serious as it is. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  And we need to be talking about this every single day and reminding people that Donald [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=215.94s)]
*  Trump is destroying everything we know about the separation of powers. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=220.1s)]
*  And let's talk about Andres Hernandez Romero, makeup artist in Venezuela, asylum seeker, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=223.7s)]
*  who was deported to El Salvador. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=230.5s)]
*  They accused him of gang affiliations based on his tattoos. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=233.62s)]
*  Were you able to have you heard anything about him at all? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  This is where we got some steps forward, but there's still not enough information out there. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=242.17999999999998s)]
*  Here's the reality. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  This is someone that had an appointment. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=246.73999999999998s)]
*  The United States government gave Andres an appointment to seek asylum at the border. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=248.82s)]
*  He came to his appointment that we provided him. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=254.98s)]
*  Then during that appointment, he gets scooped up, essentially kidnapped by ICE and Homeland [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=257.7s)]
*  Security, sent to a country he knows nothing about to a foreign prison that we know is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=262.65999999999997s)]
*  already incredibly dangerous. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=267.78s)]
*  He's someone that's described as delicate, as sweet, as kind. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=269.7s)]
*  He is obviously LGBTQ. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=274.82s)]
*  He was fleeing because he was gay from Venezuela. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  The ambassador told me directly that they are going to do a welfare check on Andres [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=279.94s)]
*  and try to get information. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=284.34s)]
*  It was the first time the government has actually agreed to do anything about his case. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=285.14s)]
*  We're working with his lawyer. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=289.78s)]
*  We're working with the embassy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=290.74s)]
*  He needs to have his due process and be brought back to the United States. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=292.09999999999997s)]
*  Congressman, please keep me informed about what you hear from the embassy about Andres' [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=295.38s)]
*  situation and whether someone tweeted out a picture of you making this announcement. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=300.82s)]
*  No one's heard from him since what, March 14th? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=308.26s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=311.46s)]
*  It's been horrific. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=311.94s)]
*  It's been weeks now. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=312.58s)]
*  No one's heard anything. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=313.38s)]
*  We don't even know if he's alive. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=314.18s)]
*  We're hoping to guide that he is and we need him back home. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=315.62s)]
*  Congressman Robert Garcia of California, thank you very much for coming to the Saturday show. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiXMBsIphqk&t=318.1s)]
