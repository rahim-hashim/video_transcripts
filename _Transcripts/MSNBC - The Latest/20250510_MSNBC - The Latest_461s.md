# ‘Is he meeting the moment?’: Democrats question Hakeem Jeffries’ leadership against Trump
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8)
*  But I am curious for both of you, because I continue hearing from voters, from activists, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=0.0s)]
*  from advocates who say they want to see Democrats doing more. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  They talk about you, too. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=8.76s)]
*  They talk about AOC and Bernie Sanders wanting and leading on this issue, being out front. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=10.28s)]
*  Do you feel like the leadership of your party is doing, they're doing enough? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=17.88s)]
*  And Senator Murph, I'll start with you, with Chuck Schumer. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=22.92s)]
*  Is he doing enough? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=24.82s)]
*  Well, listen, we're out here trying to model a way to fight to be in Republican districts, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=26.44s)]
*  not conceding that we can't build a cross-party, cross-ideological coalition against this thievery [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=35.56s)]
*  and this corruption. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=43.2s)]
*  So we're hopeful that more of our colleagues are going to do what we are doing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Listen, we're going to have some real big decisions to make in the next several months. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=48.96s)]
*  I'll give you an example that'll come up just next week. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=54.32s)]
*  In the Senate right now, we're considering a bill to regulate the crypto industry, the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=57.32s)]
*  stablecoin industry. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=62.28s)]
*  And in that bill, we really need to make it clear that the President of the United States [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=64.0s)]
*  cannot issue his own stablecoin, his own meme coin, and then benefit by deals he cuts with [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  foreign governments. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=75.68s)]
*  That seems like a pretty easy thing to do. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=76.68s)]
*  That would be a really good bottom line for Democrats to say, yeah, we'll vote to regulate [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=79.52s)]
*  the crypto industry, but only if we put real ethics requirements in that bill. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=84.16s)]
*  So we'll have these opportunities coming up to show that as Democrats, we are serious [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=89.4s)]
*  about fighting corruption. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  We'll have another chance to deny Republicans a one-party spending bill this fall if they [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=97.04s)]
*  try to push that again as they did in the spring. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  We hope that more Democrats come out here on the road like we're doing, and we'll have [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=107.48s)]
*  lots of chances in Congress to draw some hard lines, especially in our fight against this [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=111.08s)]
*  corruption in the coming weeks and months. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=115.84s)]
*  And I want to add, too, it's also important to look at what everybody's doing across the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  country. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I know many of you probably saw that news yesterday of the mayor of Newark, Ross [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  Brugge, being arrested by ICE. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=127.48s)]
*  And right alongside him and people that were fighting were members of the House Democratic [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=130.44s)]
*  caucus, Rob Menendez, and folks like that who were there using their ability to conduct [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=135.11999999999998s)]
*  oversight on ICE facilities, which, by the way, for people who don't know, members of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=140.92s)]
*  Congress, we are allowed to show up unannounced to ICE detention facilities, and we have to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=144.04s)]
*  be let in. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=148.67999999999998s)]
*  And it's in the law. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=150.04s)]
*  That's part of the reason why all that happened. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=151.44s)]
*  And so people are figuring out the different ways that they can show leadership in this [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=153.04s)]
*  moment, whether it's showing up to ICE facilities, whether it's being on the road like Senator [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  Murphy and I are, or doing rallies or this and that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=161.88s)]
*  You saw Hakeem Jeffries and Cory Booker on the steps of the Capitol doing a sit-in all [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=165.12s)]
*  day that got covered by a ton of news outlets, but also by a ton of influencers, independent [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=169.32s)]
*  media creators that are really reaching people where we need to reach them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=174.28s)]
*  We can't just talk to the people who consume news as a hobby. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=177.82s)]
*  And that's part of the reason we're trying to figure out other ways to branch out of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=181.2s)]
*  the people who are paying attention to politics and talk to people who aren't quite paying [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  attention right now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=187.76s)]
*  So we're going to have to sneak in a quick break. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=189.5s)]
*  We're back with Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Congressman Maxwell Frost of Florida. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=194.04s)]
*  Eugene? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=199.14s)]
*  I hear what you guys are talking about, or getting people up, and everyone's going to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=200.14s)]
*  start going out on the road, and you guys are showing the example. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=205.38s)]
*  But I want to start with you again, Senator Murphy, quickly. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=208.32s)]
*  Do you have faith that Chuck Schumer is meeting this moment? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=211.88s)]
*  I think Chuck Schumer has a really hard job, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=216.9s)]
*  He's got a diverse caucus, not just ideologically. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=219.77999999999997s)]
*  He's got a diverse caucus in terms of whether there's consensus on how dire this moment [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=222.14s)]
*  is. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=227.45999999999998s)]
*  So I support Chuck Schumer. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=228.45999999999998s)]
*  And I think the real question is whether Democrats writ large are going to make the decision [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=230.26s)]
*  that this is not a moment to practice politics as normal. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  There is, listen, I'll just be honest. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=238.54s)]
*  There is a debate inside the Democratic Party today. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=239.98s)]
*  Can we just kind of keep sort of punching and jabbing at Donald Trump so that eventually [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=243.17999999999998s)]
*  we get him unpopular enough that we win the midterm elections? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=249.12s)]
*  Or are we at risk of not having a free and fair election in 2026? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=252.84s)]
*  Is our mission really to act with a sense of daily urgency, working with a lot of players [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  on the outside to make sure that he doesn't destroy democracy and crush dissent to the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=263.12s)]
*  extent that even if his approval ratings are in the 30s by the summer and fall of next [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=267.88s)]
*  year, we still can't win? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=272.8s)]
*  So I certainly have argued for more forceful tactics. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=274.38s)]
*  And there is a debate playing out inside the Democratic Party. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=279.3s)]
*  So that's a debate that I think we have to win. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=282.34s)]
*  And it's part of why some of us are trying to go a little bit above and beyond to show [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  what is necessary to make sure that we protect our democracy and we don't wake up next summer [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=289.3s)]
*  and find that, well, we're going to still have an election. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=295.54s)]
*  It's not an election that Democrats can win because Donald Trump has rigged the rules [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=298.82s)]
*  of our democracy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=303.14s)]
*  And Congressman Leader Jeffries, for you, you know, when I talk to some of your colleagues [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  on the Democratic side on background, because you know, they won't say this on the record, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=310.02s)]
*  but they will say that, you know, they want him to be more out front. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=314.0s)]
*  They want a little more leadership from him. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=316.68s)]
*  They don't want him to always lean on kind of the, you know, the caucus will, will out, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=319.4s)]
*  right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=323.46s)]
*  That kind of the creed that he lives by. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=324.46s)]
*  Is he meeting the moment? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=326.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=327.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and I just spoke about that sit-in that they did. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=329.28s)]
*  The leader also gave a very impactful speech on the first hundred days of Donald Trump's, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=333.4s)]
*  you know, government here and laying out exactly what's been going on. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=342.2s)]
*  But I'll tell you, one of the things I really appreciate about Hakeem, who's going to be [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=346.08s)]
*  the next speaker here in just a couple of years, is that he allows our caucus and allows [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  people in the caucus to communicate the way we want to communicate to the people we want [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=354.92s)]
*  to communicate to. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=359.0s)]
*  And I think that's really important because everyone's asking what is the one thing we're [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=360.36s)]
*  saying and I do think we need to have our unified messenger on the fact that there's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=364.12s)]
*  theft going on right now from the American people and working people to go to billionaires. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  But the way we talk about it and where we talk about it, it's going to be a little different [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=373.12s)]
*  for everybody. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=376.52000000000004s)]
*  And I actually think that's a good thing. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  We can go to different places. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=379.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, I personally, what's happened to me is a lot of music. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=380.44s)]
*  I go to a lot of music festivals and do it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=383.92s)]
*  Not everyone's going to do that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=385.76s)]
*  People are going to go to spaces that maybe aren't best for me. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=387.2s)]
*  And Hakeem recognizes that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=390.0s)]
*  But the other thing I want to say, too, is it's not just about what we say or how we [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=391.68s)]
*  say it, but it's about where we say it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=395.64s)]
*  And we love our front to MSNBC and a lot of the more mainstream media, but we do have [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=397.56s)]
*  to branch out and get to speaking with, of course, get to speaking with a lot of these [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=402.4s)]
*  influencers and creators, independent media that a lot of people are getting their news [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=408.8s)]
*  from. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=413.24s)]
*  And we really got to branch out and do that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=414.24s)]
*  And honestly, Hakeem has been very supportive in our effort to do this. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=415.6s)]
*  Some people may know I ran for the DPCC, the Communications Committee. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=420.44s)]
*  The whole reason I ran was to make sure that we were interacting more with people outside [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=423.92s)]
*  of traditional media. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=428.32s)]
*  And we've been met with nothing but support from the leader and his team in accomplishing [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=429.92s)]
*  that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=434.04s)]
*  And we know it's not just a one-time thing that's going to solve everything. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=435.04s)]
*  It's changing the way that we communicate. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=437.12s)]
*  And I think we're moving down that road right now. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTTzXB_Pp8&t=439.32s)]
