# ‘Why would Putin make any concessions?’ Rhodes says Trump is putting zero pressure on Russia
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI)
*  Let's go to President Trump and where he is right now, the United Arab Emirates today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=0.0s)]
*  His final stop on a tour of the Middle East that has been a whirlwind of business deals [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=5.5s)]
*  and even a reshaping of America's role in that region, at least approach. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=10.16s)]
*  But much of the focus right now is on the conversations that are not happening. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=16.3s)]
*  Both President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin opted to skip peace talks with [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=21.18s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Turkey, even though it was Putin himself who first [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=26.12s)]
*  suggested the direct negotiations. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=31.32s)]
*  Zelensky showed up in Ankara and was greeted by President Erdogan, but Putin sent a low-level [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=33.88s)]
*  delegation without the power to make any real decisions to Istanbul, which is hundreds of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=39.2s)]
*  miles away, what Zelensky describes as merely a theater prop. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=43.92s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC's Keir Simmons, who is in Istanbul, Ben Rhodes is former Deputy National [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=48.84s)]
*  Security Advisor and an MSNBC political contributor. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=53.18s)]
*  So Keir, lay it out for us. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  What exactly is happening in Turkey today? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=58.48s)]
*  Well, Chris, you could either call it a mess or very sophisticated diplomatic chess. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=61.9s)]
*  Effectively, today was the day, as you say, that we were set to see for the first time [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=70.02s)]
*  the Russians and Ukrainians negotiate face to face, the first time in three years. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=76.26s)]
*  That didn't happen today. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=82.14s)]
*  I think it is going to happen tomorrow. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  The Russian delegation is here, led by Vladimir Medinsky. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=85.24s)]
*  He is a former culture minister in Russia. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=89.56s)]
*  Not very powerful, honestly. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=92.52s)]
*  He did lead the delegation three years ago in 2022. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=93.96s)]
*  I was here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=97.32s)]
*  And we were there when he announced that they will negotiate tomorrow. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=99.32s)]
*  Ukrainians we think will be. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=103.52s)]
*  It looks like Secretary Rubio will be here, the envoys, Witkoff and Kellogg. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=104.52s)]
*  So the scene is set maybe a day late. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=109.84s)]
*  President Putin usually makes others wait. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=113.64s)]
*  So this time the Russians have been made to wait. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=115.8s)]
*  And frankly, that's what this is. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=117.92s)]
*  It is negotiation happening in plain sight, negotiation happening before even the talks [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=120.0s)]
*  start. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=124.6s)]
*  And we know because of that how far apart they are. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=125.6s)]
*  Now, President Trump is still determined to try to figure out how to get Russia and Ukraine [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=128.32s)]
*  quite simply to stop fighting. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  He now says maybe it's going to need talks that do involve him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=137.72s)]
*  He's been suggesting that he might come here for days. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=142.04s)]
*  He now isn't. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=145.56s)]
*  But take a listen to what he said today. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=147.04s)]
*  Disappointed by that? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=155.04s)]
*  No, I didn't anticipate. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=157.04s)]
*  I actually said, why would he go if I'm not going? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=159.04s)]
*  Because I wasn't going to go. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=161.04s)]
*  I wasn't planning to go. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=163.04s)]
*  I would go. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=164.04s)]
*  But I wasn't planning to go. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=165.44s)]
*  And I said, I don't think he's going to go if I don't go. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=166.88s)]
*  And that turned out to be right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=168.88s)]
*  But we have people there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=170.88s)]
*  Marco, as you know, is doing a fantastic job. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=172.88s)]
*  Marco's there, Secretary of State. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=174.88s)]
*  And we have people there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=176.88s)]
*  But I don't, I don't, I didn't think it was possible for Putin to go if I'm not there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=178.88s)]
*  Effectively what the president is suggesting there, Chris, is that by force of will he [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=186.88s)]
*  can get President Putin to compromise in a way that President Putin has not said he would. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  I should just say, because when President Putin suggested these negotiations here, he [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  didn't say he would meet face to face with President Zelensky. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  That was suggested by Zelensky and by President Trump to up the stakes a little bit, if you [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  like. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  So the distance between them is still enormous. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  The Russians still say they want to go back to the negotiations from three years ago, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  which included Ukraine being virtually neutral. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine's never going to agree to that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  The Russians are just saying, we're just here to negotiate a ceasefire. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=222.6s)]
*  That's not what the Russians think they're doing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=224.6s)]
*  Tomorrow is a crucial day, a crunch day. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=226.6s)]
*  Keir, thank you for that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=229.6s)]
*  Ben, look, the president said today nothing is going to happen until Vladimir Putin and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=231.6s)]
*  I get together. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=237.6s)]
*  And so let me borrow the phraseology that Keir just used. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=238.6s)]
*  Is what we're seeing in your eyes some kind of sophisticated diplomatic chess or is it [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=243.6s)]
*  just a mess? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=248.6s)]
*  No, I mean, it's a mess because the fundamental theory of Donald Trump, that he can somehow [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=251.56s)]
*  impose a solution on a war between Russia and Ukraine, has just never been the case [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=258.56s)]
*  because Russia and Ukraine have very different views of the war that they're fighting and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=265.56s)]
*  what the outcome should be. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=270.56s)]
*  And the goalposts keep moving, by the way. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=272.56s)]
*  I mean, obviously, famously, he said this would be settled on day one. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=274.56s)]
*  Then he was trying to get a ceasefire. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=279.52s)]
*  And what's consistently happened is Ukraine, who he's often blamed for lack of progress, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=281.52s)]
*  Ukraine has often moved to the positions that the United States put forward, right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=286.52s)]
*  So remember, we were talking about a 30-day ceasefire. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=290.52s)]
*  Ukraine agreed to that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=293.52s)]
*  Russia never did. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=294.52s)]
*  And so now that idea is kind of gone away or at least has been shunted aside. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=295.52s)]
*  Then President Trump kind of essentially agreed to a lot of the Russian conditions for the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=300.52s)]
*  terms on which the war would end, the kind of recognition of the annexation of Ukrainian [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=307.47999999999996s)]
*  territory by Russia, not just Crimea, but large swaths of eastern Ukraine, up to 20 [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  percent of the country, as well as a Ukrainian promise to never be a part of NATO, essentially [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=316.47999999999996s)]
*  this idea of Ukraine being a permanently neutral state, which would leave it permanently [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=321.47999999999996s)]
*  vulnerable to Russia. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=325.47999999999996s)]
*  And so Ukraine is not going to agree to those things at the negotiating table. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=327.47999999999996s)]
*  And what Ukraine has done is it's brought in its main European backers. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=333.44s)]
*  So recently you had the chance of Germany, the President of France, the Prime Minister [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=336.44s)]
*  of the United Kingdom, and the Prime Minister of Poland go to Kyiv to kind of back up Zelensky. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=340.44s)]
*  And at that point, Zelensky said, well, look, I'll go to Turkey. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=345.44s)]
*  I'll engage in talks. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=350.44s)]
*  I'm going to do it from my own positions. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=351.44s)]
*  I'm not necessarily going to start the talks from the positions of Vladimir Putin. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=354.44s)]
*  And then Putin doesn't want to go. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=358.44s)]
*  What all this is about, Chris, is that Putin thinks he has the upper hand in the war, on [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=361.4s)]
*  the front line. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=364.4s)]
*  He thinks he has the upper hand geopolitically, because the U.S. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=365.4s)]
*  president has expressed a continued preference for him versus Zelensky. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=368.4s)]
*  So why would Putin make any concessions in that scenario? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=372.4s)]
*  That's why this is a mess, is that there's no incentive whatsoever, no pressure [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=375.4s)]
*  whatsoever for Russia to take anything other than maximalist positions that Zelensky is [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=379.4s)]
*  never going to agree to. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=383.4s)]
*  I only have a minute, but let me ask you a complicated question and try to get a truncated [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=385.4s)]
*  answer, which is about the other big negotiations that are going on about what's happening in [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=390.35999999999996s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=393.35999999999996s)]
*  Israel's carrying out another devastating assault, according to the Palestinians, killing [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=394.35999999999996s)]
*  at least 94 in airstrikes today alone. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=398.35999999999996s)]
*  Is this going anywhere? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=402.35999999999996s)]
*  Are these conversations, negotiations going anywhere, Ben? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=404.35999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  And look, Netanyahu's clearly gone all in with the far right of his coalition, who are [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=410.35999999999996s)]
*  to talk openly about kind of the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=414.35999999999996s)]
*  We are at the worst humanitarian conditions that we've seen, which is saying something [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=418.32s)]
*  in terms of no aid getting in, in terms of bombardment of people that have no structures, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=421.32s)]
*  they're living in tents, they're moving around, their land being essentially overtaken [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=425.32s)]
*  and occupied by Israeli forces. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=429.32s)]
*  If I look across the three negotiations, Gaza, Ukraine, Iran is actually the one that seems [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=431.32s)]
*  like it has the most prospect of potentially yielding something on the nuclear program. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=437.32s)]
*  So unfortunately, of the three, actually, Gaza is the one that looks the least likely [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTt9aBJ50VI&t=442.32s)]
