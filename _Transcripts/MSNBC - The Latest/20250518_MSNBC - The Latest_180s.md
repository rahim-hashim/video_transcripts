*  Officials say a Mexican naval training ship crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge, leaving [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=0.0s)]
*  two people dead and 21 injured. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=4.8s)]
*  Video from the scene showed two masts from the ship lit up in bright colors, striking [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=7.68s)]
*  the bridge with people on the mast holding on. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=11.88s)]
*  New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a news conference last night that the tall ship carrying [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  277 people suffered a mechanical mishap that caused it to veer into the bridge. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=19.68s)]
*  We want to thank the Mexican community for here appreciating our first responders. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=26.84s)]
*  The police commissioner and her team immediately responded with FDNY Commissioner Tucker to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=32.0s)]
*  have a coordinated effort. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=37.36s)]
*  We want to thank the Coast Guard and their effort as well. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=38.72s)]
*  So the coordination was extremely important and it was executed to the best of our ability [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=43.04s)]
*  to minimize any loss of life. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  It's going to be hard to go out to the family members and many family members are going [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=52.92s)]
*  to be traveling here from Mexico. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  Joining us now with the latest is NBC News correspondent Maya Eaglin. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=59.2s)]
*  Maya, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=64.2s)]
*  First question for you, I know it's early in the investigation, but what do we know [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=67.08s)]
*  about what this possible mechanical mishap can be? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=71.44s)]
*  Are there theories that law enforcement have at this point? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=74.28s)]
*  Yeah, hey there, good morning. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=78.48s)]
*  Well, we're hearing that the captain of this ship lost control. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=81.48s)]
*  There was some technical mechanical failure where they were no longer able to really [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=85.12s)]
*  steer the ship in any way. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=89.66s)]
*  If you take a look behind me, you can actually see the top of the mast over here that had [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=91.0s)]
*  an impact with the Brooklyn Bridge. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=95.8s)]
*  We're hearing that this happened around 8 20 p.m. last night. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=98.28s)]
*  Officials say there were 277 people on that ship. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=102.08s)]
*  At least 21 of them were injured. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=106.8s)]
*  And unfortunately, Mayor Eric Adams this morning confirming that two of those people [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=109.64s)]
*  injured have died from their injuries. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=114.24s)]
*  Again, the captain of this ship lost control at some point, and that's how it kind of drifted [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=117.0s)]
*  into the Brooklyn Bridge, hitting the bottom of it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=123.04s)]
*  This part of the mast tilting forward. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  We're hearing that there were people likely on the upper regions of this vessel as well. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=128.52s)]
*  Another thing to add, when we spoke to folks who came rushing to see this scene last night, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=135.48s)]
*  so many videos and photos were going viral. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=140.8s)]
*  They were shocked. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=143.38s)]
*  They were really surprised to see something this large and seeing something with this [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=144.38s)]
*  much damage, you know, in a place that is usually filled with so much tourism, boats [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=148.24s)]
*  going through all day long. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=152.92s)]
*  Again, this is still under investigation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=154.96s)]
*  We'll be keeping you posted with the latest. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTxdPjk2H8&t=157.24s)]
