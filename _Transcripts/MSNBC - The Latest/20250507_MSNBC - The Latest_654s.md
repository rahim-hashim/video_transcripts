# Papal Conclave Begins: World watching Vatican chimney in anticipation
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw)
*  I want to bring in NBC's Claudio Lavagna at the Vatican. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=0.0s)]
*  Deborah Lubov is an MSNBC Vatican analyst. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  Father Timothy Kasecki is president of the Jewish Conference of Canada and the U.S. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  So Claudio, we've been at conclaves together. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=11.56s)]
*  I remember the intensity and the anticipation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  What's the feeling there right now? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Hi, Chris. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=20.6s)]
*  Well, this is my third conclave, and I can tell you that it always just sends shivers [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  down my spine because you are watching a centuries-old tradition unfold, the election also of perhaps [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=27.48s)]
*  one of the biggest and most powerful leaders in the world, the leader of 1.4 billion Catholics. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=36.68s)]
*  And this tradition just keeps unfolding exactly in the same way by the minute, but it's also [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=43.56s)]
*  so colorful, so touching, so incredible to watch every single time. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=50.56s)]
*  And it's just happened right behind us with St. Peter's Square that you can probably see [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=55.96s)]
*  in the distance. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  There were hundreds of people watching the procession into the Sistine Chapel and the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Cardinals swearing and oath on maxi screens. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=67.84s)]
*  And when that ended and then those closers in the Sistine Chapel were closing, there [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  was this big round of applause. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=76.4s)]
*  So people here are starting to feel it, are starting to feel that something very important, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=78.8s)]
*  something historic is happening. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=83.28s)]
*  And of course, all eyes from tonight on will be on that chimney that I can see from here, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=85.48s)]
*  it's probably too in the distance for you, but it's the chimney on the Sistine Chapel [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=91.72s)]
*  waiting for that first smoke. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  We'll see whether it's white tonight. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  I mean, in recent history, it's never been white on the first ballot, but who knows? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're getting the feel of the place, but you never know. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  Somebody who predicts what's going to happen in a conclave is maybe a little bit of a full [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=109.68s)]
*  verand. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=114.4s)]
*  Deborah, from 12 years ago, when we had a conclave before, a lot has changed technologically. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=115.4s)]
*  The world is more interconnected than ever before. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  Certainly social media has been blowing up. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  I saw on one blog today someone saying, is there a service I can sign up for so that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=128.4s)]
*  if it happens in the middle of night, it wakes me up? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=134.8s)]
*  There clearly is international interest in this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=137.88s)]
*  This is a global church. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=141.84s)]
*  Are you seeing the internationality of this, not just in the media, but in the folks who [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=143.16s)]
*  are down there on St. Peter's Square? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=147.72s)]
*  Well, certainly it is undeniable that there has been an incredible presence from different [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=150.64s)]
*  continents throughout the Vatican. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=156.22s)]
*  It's also true that it's still the Easter season. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=158.12s)]
*  It is one of the busiest times in the Vatican. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=160.32s)]
*  It's also the Jubilee year. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=162.56s)]
*  All of this coincided with Pope Francis' death and coincides with this historic conclave. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=163.64s)]
*  But anyone you speak to, they're all very moved to be here at this moment, whether or [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=170.82s)]
*  not they had come out for the conclave itself or if they're here to be part of it, regardless. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=173.88s)]
*  Yeah, great history being made. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  Father, Francis was the first Jesuit pope. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=182.92s)]
*  I think I might have said Jewish, which would be a shocker if you were head of a Jewish [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  organization. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=190.64s)]
*  I apologize for that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=193.0s)]
*  But he has appointed the most geographically diverse college of cardinals we have ever [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=194.92s)]
*  seen, many of them getting together for the first time over this last week or so. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=199.72s)]
*  One Vatican watcher said it was kind of like speed dating. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=205.16s)]
*  You're trying to talk to everybody. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=207.68s)]
*  You're trying to see where everybody stands. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  Do we have a sense of how that works? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=211.98s)]
*  Some people say, look, that's great. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=216.0s)]
*  It really helps to sort of bridge some divides. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=218.6s)]
*  Or I've heard from other people saying, actually, I've had to take some people off the list, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=221.68s)]
*  add some other people potentially to the list because now I'm hearing about so many different [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=228.0s)]
*  possible people. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=232.64s)]
*  What's your sense of where this is right now as they make this first vote? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=234.28s)]
*  Well, it's true. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=237.48s)]
*  Of the 133 electors who are present in the conclave, Pope Francis appointed 108 of them. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=238.88s)]
*  But there's a certain mystery to it because, as you noted, a lot of them do not know each [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=246.92s)]
*  other. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=253.24s)]
*  And they're not only getting to know each other, but for many of them, this is the first [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=254.68s)]
*  time they've ever been to a conclave. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=258.12s)]
*  So it's not like an election. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=260.76s)]
*  And there is an election. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=265.08s)]
*  But it's not like an election where there's polling and canvassing and there's some indicators. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=266.36s)]
*  Really, we know nothing of what those electors are really thinking and praying about. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=270.44s)]
*  We're only going to find that when we see the outcome of their vote. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=276.24s)]
*  Yeah, one of the curiosities is, if I can make a comparison, which is a bad comparison, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=280.52000000000004s)]
*  Deborah, to the U.S. election, a lot of people, after all of the attention on it, were shocked [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=285.76000000000005s)]
*  to hear some people saying, I'll go in and I'll make up my mind when I'm actually in [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=290.72s)]
*  the ballot box, you know, when I'm in the voting booth. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  Is there a sense that, at least for this first vote, most of the cardinals pretty much know [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  where they're going by the time they walk into the Sistine Chapel? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=304.08s)]
*  That's anyone's guess. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=310.0s)]
*  I think that a lot of people know what issues are important to them. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=311.0s)]
*  So each of these cardinals in their mind have been praying about who they think should be [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=314.08s)]
*  the next successor of Peter. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=318.68s)]
*  And they may not know who that individual is. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's why it has been so important that they've had this quality time in order to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  get to know each other, because otherwise it's hard for them to know which way the Holy [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=325.44s)]
*  Spirit is leading them. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=329.32s)]
*  But they're depending on exactly that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=330.32s)]
*  The New York Times was talking about how the cardinals discuss everything from war to sexual [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=332.36s)]
*  abuse. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=337.36s)]
*  I'm sure the finances, Claudio, of the Vatican are also a big topic. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=338.36s)]
*  You know, quietly maybe holding some spin sessions. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=343.48s)]
*  Other people have called it dinner table lobbying. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, they get together. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=349.08s)]
*  Many of them have, the American cardinals have been over at the North American College. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=351.24s)]
*  Some of them have already been over at Casa Santa Marta. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=355.48s)]
*  What is the buzz that you're hearing going into this conclave? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=358.6s)]
*  How wide open is it? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=361.84s)]
*  Well, certainly they're not just looking for a pastor. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=365.44s)]
*  They're also looking for an administrator. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=368.35999999999996s)]
*  As you mentioned, the Catholic Church is going through a financial crisis, so they will need [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  someone who just needs to put that back in order. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  Also, they had, as Deborah was saying, they haven't really met each other before they [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=379.88s)]
*  arrived here for the funeral of Pope Francis and for the days following that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  They had nine days to not only know each other and get together at dinners and lunches, but [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=391.24s)]
*  also during, especially, the general congregations. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  There were these meetings that took place every single day where each cardinal had the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=401.0s)]
*  opportunity to talk, to address, to say who they're looking for in the next pope. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=405.6s)]
*  Not names, just who they think, what subjects, what themes, what's his personality, what [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=410.94s)]
*  are his ideas. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=419.84s)]
*  So they had time to know each other. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=421.28s)]
*  And if we see black smoke tonight, as we expect, because historically that's what's happened, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=424.56s)]
*  unless we have surprises, they still get a chance tonight to meet over dinner because [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=429.96s)]
*  it's all secretive, but not for them. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=436.08s)]
*  They will just get together in the Domus Santa Marta that is the guest house inside the Vatican, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=438.48s)]
*  where also Pope Francis decided to reside. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=444.08s)]
*  They're all sleeping there and also in a next door building, but they can all eat together. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=446.35999999999996s)]
*  So once the first vote is done, they can start looking at numbers and see who is getting [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=451.32s)]
*  the most votes. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=458.24s)]
*  And maybe if one cardinal got one or two votes, maybe those two votes are going to go to someone [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=459.24s)]
*  else who has more votes and who may be similar to that cardinal they voted for, so they get [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=464.82s)]
*  more chances to get their men through. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=470.59999999999997s)]
*  So you see this is a lot of politics, but also at the same time, as I mentioned earlier, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=473.32s)]
*  they're not just looking for a next Pope Francis. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=479.36s)]
*  They're looking for perhaps continuity because that's possible because obviously 80 percent [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  of the cardinals who are voting were appointed by Pope Francis, but also they're looking [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=488.76s)]
*  for an administrator, someone who can just, you know, perhaps fix the financial problems [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=494.32s)]
*  that is going through, Chris. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=502.16s)]
*  Yeah, so an easy job, in other words, just, you know, one or two things that you have [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=503.72s)]
*  to worry about. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=507.52s)]
*  Father, there is also the question of firsts. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=508.8s)]
*  We mentioned that Pope Francis was the first Jesuit Pope. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=511.88s)]
*  We could see the first Asian Pope. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=516.4s)]
*  We could see the first Pope from Africa, the first from America. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=518.06s)]
*  All of those things are in conversations out there. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=522.96s)]
*  At the same time, when they took that oath, they swore to avoid secular politics per se. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=525.76s)]
*  Do you think geography, and by that I mean particularly looking at where the church is [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=532.2s)]
*  growing as opposed to say Europe, where the church is not, will and should play a role [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=537.12s)]
*  in their decision? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=543.52s)]
*  I appreciate that distinction that they're not supposed to take secular politics into [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=545.52s)]
*  account, but I would maybe fine tune that a bit and say that they're not supposed to [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=549.88s)]
*  take constitutive politics. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=555.28s)]
*  So they're not there exclusively to represent their part of the world, but they come from [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=557.52s)]
*  that part of the world. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=562.56s)]
*  And as you noted, this is the highest percentage of non-European cardinals in the history of [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=563.68s)]
*  the church. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=569.56s)]
*  It's also the largest conclave by far in the history of the church, more than double the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=570.56s)]
*  number of cardinals from 100 years ago. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  So they're going to think about that growth of the church in what we often call the global [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=578.6s)]
*  south, and that is going to influence their vote. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=583.48s)]
*  The other thing I like to reflect on is that the secrecy in the conclave is not cloak and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=586.6400000000001s)]
*  dagger. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=591.7600000000001s)]
*  You know, it's not something of a Dan Brown novel. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=592.7600000000001s)]
*  The secrecy is so that every elector recognizes that he's listening to God and the Holy Spirit. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=596.44s)]
*  And so that's also a part of where does God see the future of the church? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=601.48s)]
*  And I think that they are going to look at the global south where the church is growing [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  the fastest. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=612.4s)]
*  Just imagine anybody out there not having your phone. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=613.72s)]
*  One cardinal said, how am I going to wake up? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=617.2s)]
*  I use my phone as my alarm clock. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=620.0s)]
*  I'm sure that they've figured that out in the meantime, something a little less high [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=622.6s)]
*  tech. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=626.12s)]
*  Claudio Lavagna, Deborah Lubov, I hope you have your sleeping bags with you. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=627.12s)]
*  Father Timothy Kesecki, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXhFcis0Afw&t=630.36s)]
