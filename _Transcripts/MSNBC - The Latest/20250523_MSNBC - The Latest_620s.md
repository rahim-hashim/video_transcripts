*  Thank you for having me. I want to begin by reading another piece of this story from you and your colleague Tim [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=284.5s)]
*  Dickinson you write Trump does not hold space in his mind for any [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=291.42s)]
*  Distinction between his private interest and the public interest a deal is a deal [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=298.06s)]
*  The president has said in the past and several months according. He said that several months ago according to two of your sources [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=302.41999999999996s)]
*  That's interesting a deal is a deal [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=310.53999999999996s)]
*  No distinction between being president for 330 million Americans and being in business for himself [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=313.3s)]
*  As I said, this is new territory. We've never seen anything like this before [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=320.74s)]
*  You were saying at the top of this segment that critics have described [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=324.90000000000003s)]
*  that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=329.1s)]
*  crypto Trump summit as an orgy of corruption [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=330.62s)]
*  I mean there isn't really a more apt term than that to use to describe not just that one event [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=333.3s)]
*  But what's been going on for the past few months after Donald Trump retook the White House? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=340.46000000000004s)]
*  It's not just the crypto stuff. It's not having to do with his family business empire [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=345.26000000000005s)]
*  Business empire it's the Qatari government sky palace that was gifted to him [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=349.97999999999996s)]
*  He likes to say the government but it'll be there for his potential private use via his presidential library foundation [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=356.3s)]
*  Once he's no longer leader of free world and we could go on and on and you said multiple times that this is [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=363.06s)]
*  Uncharted territory. I don't think that that is something that can be drilled [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=369.98s)]
*  Into the American consciousness enough if anything it is being undersold right now in our politics in our media [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=374.21999999999997s)]
*  about the level of corruption that Donald Trump and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=380.94s)]
*  his business associates and his business empire and his family are [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=385.06s)]
*  Perpetuating right now as they cash in over and over and over again [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=391.29999999999995s)]
*  One is holding of the office presidency and the thing about it that is even worse than the first Trump term [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=396.34s)]
*  And Trump's first term in office was by no means [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=403.02000000000004s)]
*  Sweetie cleanings maps. It was also staggeringly corrupt [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=406.78000000000003s)]
*  He has somehow eclipsed even these sky-high standards of that and it's just so out in the open and so brazen [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=410.14000000000004s)]
*  It's I'm running out of polite words to use to describe it on the air. Yes, when you of course [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=418.14000000000004s)]
*  Democrats have been raising alarms about this [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=425.02000000000004s)]
*  But you also talked to a lot of Republicans and the White House and on Capitol Hill are any of them expressing [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=427.06s)]
*  Misgivings about this kind of behavior even in private if they don't want to be quoted on the record [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=432.98s)]
*  Every once in a while they might do the occasional PR manicuring [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=441.06s)]
*  They might sigh a little bit on the phone or in person [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=444.62s)]
*  Describing. Oh, I wish maybe the president I say it's won't do this, but would it shock you or your viewers at all to [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=449.54s)]
*  Hear that the Republican Party elite right now, which is a wholly owned [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=457.3s)]
*  Subsidiary of trumpism the moment is just letting him get away with this or in some cases. They're just gleefully backing [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=462.1s)]
*  I mean the standard on this is something very similar to what we reported on when we were asking [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=469.3s)]
*  Republicans in the administration and who have advised Trump for years on what is your legal standard for a second? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=477.86s)]
*  Presidency particularly with regards to executive power or immigration things like that and there was one lawyer was talking to who simply stated [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=485.58s)]
*  The prevailing legal principle is and I quote [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=493.29999999999995s)]
*  What are you gonna do? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=496.62s)]
*  You can apply the what are you gonna do about mentality to how he and his family and his lieutenants have been conducting themselves [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=498.26s)]
*  When it comes to not just defending the perpetuating his gargantuan levels of corruption right now [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=505.62s)]
*  This is not Trump's only [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=512.46s)]
*  Crypto venture you write that this seems that that all of them seem to be heavily supported by foreign [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=514.9s)]
*  Capital capital and the people who would normally investigate that the Attorney General [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=522.98s)]
*  Secretary of State [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=530.0600000000001s)]
*  Seem to be looking the other way. So where is any kind of [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=531.58s)]
*  Of [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=537.42s)]
*  You know [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=538.62s)]
*  Any kind of authority that would look over his shoulder tap his shoulders say you've got to stop doing this [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=539.82s)]
*  I mean, I guess that's what the lawyer was saying who's gonna stop him from doing this [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=544.28s)]
*  At least for the time being particularly in a pre [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=550.02s)]
*  Midterms environment there just isn't a [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=555.66s)]
*  There is he is essentially going unchecked on these matters because at the risk of repeating myself [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=559.22s)]
*  The prevailing legal principle in this administration of what are you gonna do about it and also [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=565.42s)]
*  Not only is Attorney General Pambani and people like that aggressively and intentionally looking the other way [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=572.42s)]
*  but president Trump [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=578.9399999999999s)]
*  Directs them on what to do. He's evaporated the supposed a judicial and legal independence of them [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=581.54s)]
*  Aspen soup saying thank you very much for this reporting. Good to be with you tonight. Thanks so much [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSrzfBUf4Y&t=588.42s)]
