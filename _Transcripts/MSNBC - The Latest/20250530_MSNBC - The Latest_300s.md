# Trump's attack on universities is an attack on a 'cornerstone of the economy'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw)
*  Sammy, it looks like Trump loves having this fight with Harvard, right? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's tough for people. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=6.2s)]
*  It's very rare, and I want to be kind to John. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=7.2s)]
*  People outside the Harvard universe don't root for Harvard. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=11.4s)]
*  No. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=14.36s)]
*  Right? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=15.36s)]
*  It's the elitist of the elite. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=16.36s)]
*  Trump loves this fight. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=17.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's the epitome of—for him, it's a culture war fight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=18.6s)]
*  But I actually think for the people behind him in the administration, this is actually [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=21.36s)]
*  about destroying the higher education system. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=24.94s)]
*  I think for him, it's just about beating Harvard, though, and coming out on top of that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=27.84s)]
*  But in reality, they're cutting a ton of medical research. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=31.32s)]
*  The hit to the economy from kicking out these international students will be billions of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=34.76s)]
*  dollars, and while they'll say, okay, that's fine, but when you add up the billions of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=39.24s)]
*  dollars from the tariffs, the billions of dollars lost in tourism, the billions of dollars [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=43.04s)]
*  lost to the Treasury market, it's just—you ultimately end up with total chaos. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=46.84s)]
*  And I don't know—this is a cornerstone of the economy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=53.0s)]
*  This feeds into the labor market. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  It feeds into jobs. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  And it's, again, it's like this anti-intellectual spree. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=58.64s)]
*  You want to talk about bringing dollars to the U.S.? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  How about full tuition paying international students? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  You are at Harvard day in and day out. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  And I've never—I've been there for 25 years, Steph. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=69.72s)]
*  I have never seen the campus more united than it is today. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=71.96s)]
*  Now Harvard graduate Tommy Barone said the same thing to us last night. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=78.4s)]
*  Tell us more. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=82.16s)]
*  And he would know. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=83.32s)]
*  And not only that, but there have been multiple texts and phone calls from my friends around [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=85.32s)]
*  the country sending their support for Harvard and also asking me to go down to the coop [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=91.96s)]
*  to send them a sweatshirt or a t-shirt. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=97.72s)]
*  They're not Harvard graduates, but they want to wear the colors to support because at a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=100.8s)]
*  time when so many institutions are at risk and when so many other institutions are not [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=105.88s)]
*  able to stand up or are folding, Harvard hasn't. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  And that is something that I think is actually one of the highest brands in America right [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=116.6s)]
*  now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=121.84s)]
*  When we actually look at the points, it absolutely is. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=122.84s)]
*  I think it's a really bad fight to pick. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=126.16s)]
*  Harvard is one of the greatest American brands. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=129.64s)]
*  And it's a place where all the smart people in America go. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=132.24s)]
*  They have tons of money. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=135.12s)]
*  They elect presidents. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=136.16s)]
*  I mean, it's a really bad fight to pick. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=137.16s)]
*  And where all the smart people want to go. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=138.16s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=140.64s)]
*  Let me just make a point. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=141.64s)]
*  I have a child who just graduated high school. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=143.64s)]
*  And I'm going to look right at you. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=145.76s)]
*  This argument that they're telling you that ain't nobody wants to go to Harvard right [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=147.04s)]
*  now is baloney. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=150.28s)]
*  Baloney. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=152.4s)]
*  If your child is smart enough to go to Harvard, there's a really, really good chance they [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=154.32s)]
*  want to go there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=158.2s)]
*  If your child is not a good enough student to go to Harvard, you still really, really, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=159.2s)]
*  really want your child to go there. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=162.76s)]
*  I think that's 100% right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  It's like when he picked a fight with the NFL or maybe he wants to pick a fight with [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=165.76s)]
*  the Yankees. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=168.6s)]
*  He's picking a fight with Apple as well. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=170.0s)]
*  This is one of our greatest brands to the world. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=171.44s)]
*  And every person in America aspires to have their kid go to Harvard or Yale. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=175.0s)]
*  It's the American dream. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  And I also think they are very formidable. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=180.2s)]
*  They've got a massive endowment. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=182.48s)]
*  They've got all these resources. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=184.24s)]
*  And they will wear him down. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  And I think over time, it's like attacking a very fundamental institution of America. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=187.4s)]
*  And I think it's a stupid fight for him to pick, but it's something he does often. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  You know, let's also remember that Donald Trump has constantly bragged that he went [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=196.28s)]
*  to an Ivy League college. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=199.4s)]
*  And you know how he got there. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=200.88s)]
*  As did JD Vance. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=202.68s)]
*  And as did his son-in-law. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=203.68s)]
*  As did Pete Banks, Seth. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=204.68s)]
*  And his son-in-law, Jared, went to Harvard. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  After his father gave a $10 million donation, I believe. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  I think that greased the wheels, possibly. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  But the main point is that Donald Trump understands that going to an excellent university is a [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  mark not only of your own personal success, but of opportunity in the United States. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=220.56s)]
*  And he has busily broadcast that about himself for decades and about his son-in-law more [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=225.28s)]
*  recently. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=230.92s)]
*  All of this is performative. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  And he's doing it because it's based on the idea that the elites are out to hurt you, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=233.4s)]
*  whether they're in public service at HHS or whether they're in federal courthouses or [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=239.0s)]
*  whether they're in the media or whether they're in universities. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=245.0s)]
*  They are all alive to suppress you and screw you over. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=248.12s)]
*  The reality is, as you noted, anyone worth their smarts would want their children to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=251.66s)]
*  go to a place like Harvard because it's a jewel in the crown. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=256.42s)]
*  And it is a great institution. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=260.26s)]
*  Secondly, there's a lot of other entities that are taking cues from Harvard's willingness [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=262.06s)]
*  to fight back and take Trump to court. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=267.26s)]
*  PBS sued Trump today. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=269.9s)]
*  Wilmer Hale pushed back and got a ruling, just like the trading partners have come to understand [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=272.5s)]
*  about him because he's taco. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsFjNVD_WKw&t=277.94s)]
