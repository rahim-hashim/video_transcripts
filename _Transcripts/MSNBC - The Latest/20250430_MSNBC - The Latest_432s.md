# 'Historic debacle': Trump sets new standard for poor presidential performance; Americans displeased
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA)
*  This first hundred days of this presidency have been, there's a lot of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=0.0s)]
*  the ways you could call it, a lot of people have been coming up with good [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=6.96s)]
*  signs but they're on spin on it. I would say it's been a historic debacle. But I [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  would also say that one of the most important things to know about that is [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=14.08s)]
*  that the country is very clearly wide awake to it, right? This is not a secret. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=17.04s)]
*  Quote, Trump appears to be less popular at the 100-day mark than any other [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=22.72s)]
*  president since the inception of approval polling, says the Financial Times. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=28.0s)]
*  Headline, Trump's approval at 100 days lower than any president in at least seven [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=33.76s)]
*  decades. Headline, poll finds more Americans give Trump an F than any other [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=39.36s)]
*  grade for his first 100 days. They asked Americans to grade him. More Americans [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=45.32s)]
*  gave him an F than any other grade. Headline, new polls reveal Americans, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=50.2s)]
*  including Republicans, losing faith in Trump. And you pile on top of that the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=54.24s)]
*  economic judgment that is pouring in now in reaction to Trump's bizarre economic [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=61.24s)]
*  policy decisions. Donald Trump's first hundred days mark worst for US stock [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=68.52000000000001s)]
*  market since Gerald Ford. US stocks have underperformed the rest of the world [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=73.4s)]
*  this year by the widest margin in more than three decades as Trump's erratic [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=78.68s)]
*  policymaking sparks an investor exodus from American assets. Quote, US economy [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  shrinks three-tenths of a percent in the first quarter as Trump trade wars disrupt [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=91.08000000000001s)]
*  businesses. US economy shrank in early 2025 as Trump tariffs sapped growth. I [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  mean, it's bad. I would say it's an historic debacle. But, you know, it's not [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  over yet. We're only 100 days in. How's he handling this bad news? How are his [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=113.12s)]
*  political skills at this moment for handling a political moment like this? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=118.0s)]
*  Well, here's another headline for you from today. Headline, Trump on tariffs says, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=123.92s)]
*  quote, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30. He really did say [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=129.96s)]
*  this on camera at the White House. I'll spare you the tape. I'll tell you that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=137.76s)]
*  his exact quote was, well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=142.2s)]
*  30 dolls, you know, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=147.28s)]
*  than they would normally. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=152.48s)]
*  That's a little snapshot of the president's political skills right now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  That's his political instincts, his ability to know just the right thing to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  say in a difficult moment. That's how sharp he is at this point in his life. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=165.76s)]
*  He is handling the disastrous American public opinion polling and his [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=170.08s)]
*  performance thus far and the self-imposed total self-immolation of the US economy [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  by telling America's children, you know what, you have too many toys anyway. Suck [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=178.52s)]
*  it up, kids. Also, buy my crypto coin. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=182.68s)]
*  You can maybe tie it all up in a bow with this new polling from the Public [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=188.4s)]
*  Religion Research Institute. Axios got the first look at this polling, and I [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  think their headline on it sums it up well. Quote, most Americans see Trump as [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=197.76s)]
*  a, quote, dangerous dictator. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=202.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what that poll found. And the exact phrase that was put to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=206.67999999999998s)]
*  people in this large, well-respected poll was, President Trump is a dangerous [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=211.16s)]
*  dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American democracy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=215.76s)]
*  Do you agree? The answer was yes. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  By eight points, yes, a majority of Americans agree with that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=225.08s)]
*  Fifty-two percent of the country agrees with that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=229.24s)]
*  Break it down along racial lines. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=234.0s)]
*  Sixty-seven percent of black Americans agree that Donald Trump is a dangerous [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=235.52s)]
*  dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American democracy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=240.16s)]
*  Sixty-seven percent of black Americans. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=243.8s)]
*  Latino Americans, 63 percent. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=246.76s)]
*  Asian American or Pacific Islander, 58 percent. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=249.84s)]
*  It's only white people among whom a majority do not agree with that statement. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=252.6s)]
*  But even among white people, it's still 45 percent. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=256.96s)]
*  A dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  democracy. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=266.36s)]
*  Speaking of Trump's power being limited, court losses keep piling up for him. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=270.8s)]
*  Trump is now being forced by the courts to reinstate the more than 1,400 people he [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=275.0s)]
*  tried to fire from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump has also just been ordered to pay Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  12 million dollars in grant funding they were owed in April, according to their [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=289.56s)]
*  congressional appropriation, that Trump nevertheless was refusing to pay out. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=293.8s)]
*  And that ruling is important in its own terms. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  But in that ruling, you should know there was sort of an important statement that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=300.16s)]
*  went along with it. Language in the ruling from the judge in this case, who is a [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=306.20000000000005s)]
*  very conservative 81 year old Ronald Reagan appointed judge in Washington. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=310.12s)]
*  He closed his ruling in this case by noting that the constitutional paradigm that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=315.36s)]
*  mandates that Trump can't block this funding that was approved by Congress, that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=322.2s)]
*  constitutional paradigm in the judge's words is, quote, a framework that has [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  propelled the United States to heights of greatness, liberty and prosperity [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=330.0s)]
*  unparalleled in the history of the world for nearly 250 years. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  If our nation is to thrive for another 250 years, each coequal branch of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=339.24s)]
*  government must be willing to courageously exert the authority entrusted to it by our [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=344.72s)]
*  founders. Judge Royce Lamberth, deeply, deeply conservative veteran judge in the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=351.68s)]
*  Federal District Court today, not yesterday in Washington. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=358.2s)]
*  What a time, right? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=363.28s)]
*  I mean, this is the end of the 100 days. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=365.44s)]
*  This is the start of the second 100 days. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=366.92s)]
*  And here's Donald Trump, less popular than any president has been at this point in [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=369.6s)]
*  his presidency since the dawn of modern polling. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=375.12s)]
*  He's like blaming Joe Biden for everything he's doing. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=378.6s)]
*  He's complaining that the polls must be fake. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=381.8s)]
*  All of them. He's telling America's kids that, you know what, they've had it too [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=384.96s)]
*  good and that's about to change. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=389.16s)]
*  Well, meanwhile, the courts are finding their voice and the people never lost [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=392.72s)]
*  theirs in the first place. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=396.92s)]
*  Second 200, second 100 days. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=400.0s)]
*  The country seems like we're ready. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=403.2s)]
*  Tonight, we're just getting started. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=406.16s)]
*  Lots to come tonight. Stay with us. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXp46jFl2FA&t=407.24s)]
