# Trump when asked about deportations:  ‘Nothing will ever be perfect’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU)
*  Joining us now, NBC's Von Hilliard, who's covering the White House, Ashley Parker, staff [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=0.0s)]
*  writer for The Atlantic. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=4.12s)]
*  Your interview with the president is the June cover story. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=5.12s)]
*  Also with us, Carlos Curbelo, former Republican carnage from Florida. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=9.34s)]
*  So Von, what else is the White House saying about all this? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=12.96s)]
*  Right, well number one, Jose, there is now an express pattern here that we have seen [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  from this administration over the last weeks making claims about individuals who they have [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=20.22s)]
*  to remove from the United States in the instance of some individuals who they had claimed had [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=26.16s)]
*  gang affiliations, yet it presented no facts or no details as to their connections. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=32.0s)]
*  And now in this case, you have the individuals, the mothers denying through their legal representation [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=36.72s)]
*  that they made the decision to have their children be removed from the country to Honduras [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=43.04s)]
*  with them in the case of one four year old boy who was receiving cancer treatment. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=49.64s)]
*  And from the administration's standpoint, they have continued over the last weeks and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=54.56s)]
*  including here today from Tom Homan and Caroline Levitt making the case that these were individuals [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  who were number one in the country illegally and on undocumented status. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  And that is where the family members who have been deported with them are by nature going [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=70.54s)]
*  to suffer the consequences of the decisions that their parents or in the cases that these [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=76.56s)]
*  mothers made to come into the United States and have their children here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=81.32s)]
*  Despite being undocumented, I want to let you listen to the press secretary earlier [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=84.88s)]
*  this morning. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=87.88s)]
*  This president is trying to simply enforce our nation's immigration laws and is facing [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=90.72s)]
*  roadblock after roadblock. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=95.28s)]
*  So we're complying with court orders, but as Tom Homan has said every day, we're going [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  to continue to forge ahead with this mass deportation campaign. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=101.32s)]
*  And the president is open to all remedies to do that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  And again, the question here is to what extent is the administration following court orders [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=107.76s)]
*  of Kilmar Abrego Garcia remains in El Salvador? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  And in the case of these three young U.S. citizen children, they have already been removed [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=115.4s)]
*  from the United States and are already in Honduras. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  So Carlos, I'm just wondering because, you know, Donald Trump and Tom Homan for the entire [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=122.84s)]
*  presidential election were talking about something like this. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=128.72s)]
*  If it ever happened, that would be the outcome. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=136.84s)]
*  U.S. born children. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=137.84s)]
*  And if their parents are undocumented and are being deported, they have the choice to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=139.08s)]
*  whether bring them along or not. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  But the question is the due process issue. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=146.52s)]
*  And I'm just wondering, Carlos, do you think this is going to have some kind of weight [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  in the White House? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  Carlos, I'm not hearing you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=160.24s)]
*  Check the mute button there for a second. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  It was not the mute button. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=166.72s)]
*  But what I was saying is that while the administration understands that there's still broad public [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=168.04s)]
*  support for aggressive enforcement of immigration law in this country, they also know that there's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  a breaking point. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=177.92s)]
*  And these human stories, I remember this from the first Trump term when I was serving in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=179.44s)]
*  Congress when the child separation policy shocked so many Americans. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=183.32s)]
*  That's when the administration lost the public on the immigration issue. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=188.44s)]
*  The immigration issue has been Donald Trump's signature issue, his strongest issue. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=192.44s)]
*  The country is willing to be patient with him and with Republicans as they try to correct [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=197.96s)]
*  some of the excesses under the previous administration. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=203.84s)]
*  But once these human stories really start hitting, connecting with the public in a very [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=207.68s)]
*  dramatic way, then that becomes a danger zone for the administration. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=213.84s)]
*  They could lose the public and that, of course, could be bad news for congressional Republicans [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=218.92s)]
*  as they head into the next election. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=224.32s)]
*  Ashley, in your interview for the Atlantic, you asked the president what would happen [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=226.44s)]
*  if his administration accidentally deported the wrong person, a legal resident or even [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=230.83999999999997s)]
*  a U.S. citizen. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  He said, quote, Let me tell you that nothing will ever be perfect in this world. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  What do you think he meant by that? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=240.76s)]
*  I think he meant that the administration will make mistakes. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=244.44s)]
*  As the Atlantic reported, they have already in court filings, for instance, admitted that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=250.56s)]
*  they've made mistakes, that the Maryland father who was deported to a prison in El Salvador, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=255.52s)]
*  that was a, quote, unquote, administrative error. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=262.02s)]
*  That was a mistake. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=264.96s)]
*  It was an interesting response. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=266.96s)]
*  And in fact, if you believe that nothing in life will be perfect, that is in fact an argument [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=268.56s)]
*  for due process. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=274.6s)]
*  And Ashley, I just want to know because it is such an unusual thing that the president [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=277.2s)]
*  would sit down with the Atlantic and give you and your colleagues so much time to do [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=283.6s)]
*  it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=290.08s)]
*  Well, unusual because of there's been no love lost from the president towards the Atlantic. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=291.08s)]
*  Take us into that room. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  Take me into that moment in that interview. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=297.24s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  So for our cover story, the back story is kind of wild. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  So I'm just going to start a little back before that Oval Office interview. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=305.68s)]
*  We're doing a cover on President Trump. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=309.0s)]
*  We wanted to explain his remarkable political comeback and how he is wielding power. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=310.8s)]
*  Now we had put in for an interview request, as you would with any White House. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=315.36s)]
*  We were tentatively told we had one. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=319.02s)]
*  Then right as we were about to go in, this is about a month or two ago, someone showed [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=321.36s)]
*  some things I had said and written that he didn't like. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=326.16s)]
*  And he very publicly untrue social canceled that interview, attacking me and my co-author, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=329.52s)]
*  Michael Shearer by name. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=333.84s)]
*  We then found we're able to get the president's cell phone number. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=335.76s)]
*  Michael called him on a Saturday morning in Bedminster. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=339.84s)]
*  It's an unknown number to the president. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=342.48s)]
*  He picked up, said hello and spoke with Michael for 20 minutes. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=344.6s)]
*  So we had that interview. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=349.8s)]
*  And then after the story had closed and gone to the presses, we actually got a call last [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=351.38s)]
*  week from an aide to the president who said, are you guys free along with your boss editor [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=356.32s)]
*  and chief Jeffrey Goldberg tomorrow, a day away to come into the Oval Office and interview [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=361.98s)]
*  the president? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=367.7s)]
*  We were told we'd have 20 minutes and we ended up having an hour. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=368.7s)]
*  So the entire thing has been a bit of a whirlwind. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=372.24s)]
*  You know, Jeffrey Goldberg, who was involved in that whole signal gate issue. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=375.54s)]
*  What was the kind of like the back and forth like? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=381.26s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=384.5s)]
*  It's a question so many people have understandably. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=385.5s)]
*  And you know, if you've covered Trump, the one thing you know about him, the thing that [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=389.38s)]
*  is very consistent is he is someone who is trying to win the minute, the hour, the day, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=392.41999999999996s)]
*  the person directly in front of him. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=397.62s)]
*  And he is very savvy about his audience and his goals. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=400.18s)]
*  So he had attacked us on truth social several times, specifically Jeff Goldberg. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=403.53999999999996s)]
*  But when we went in, in that moment, President Trump was the version of himself that is charismatic, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=409.66s)]
*  charming, respectful in the interview. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=415.22s)]
*  He was very much oriented towards Jeff, kind of trying to win him over to make sure that [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=418.26000000000005s)]
*  Jeff really understood where he Donald Trump was coming from. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=423.82000000000005s)]
*  What was his plan? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=428.90000000000003s)]
*  As he put it, you know, to save humanity for this term in his presidency. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=429.90000000000003s)]
*  And one other interesting thing when he had attacked Jeff most recently on the morning [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=435.74s)]
*  of our interview, he had said, you know, Signalgate was somewhat of a success. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=438.9s)]
*  And so when we went in, Jeff asked him, what exactly did you mean by that? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=443.9s)]
*  Did you mean, you know, we exposed operational security flaws that you have now corrected? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=446.97999999999996s)]
*  And it was sort of a game respects game moment. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=452.29999999999995s)]
*  Actually, the president said, no, no, it was a success because you really broke through. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=454.94s)]
*  You really dominated the news cycle. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=459.34s)]
*  And Trump in many ways, in addition to being the president of the United States, is sort [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=461.78s)]
*  of a frustrated media mogul. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=465.85999999999996s)]
*  And he respects someone who can own a news cycle, which is what Jeff and the Atlantic [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=468.78000000000003s)]
*  did with Signalgate. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=472.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=473.62s)]
*  And Carlos is thinking about owning the news cycle. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=474.62s)]
*  It's something that the president is very keen and has been very keen on. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=477.26s)]
*  Even before he was in politics, that was his focus. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=482.06s)]
*  The polls that are coming in and there's there are a new series of polls, the most recent [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=485.18s)]
*  ones, for the most part, they show a majority approve of the plan to deport people here [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=489.54s)]
*  illegally. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=494.42s)]
*  The question is how it's being done. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=495.42s)]
*  For example, in a new CBS News, you gov poll, 73 percent say it's not acceptable for legal [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=498.02s)]
*  U.S. residents to be mistakenly detained. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=506.14s)]
*  81 percent say it's not acceptable for legal U.S. residents to be mistakenly deported. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=508.65999999999997s)]
*  67 percent believe noncitizens should face a court hearing or other legal processes before [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=514.22s)]
*  being deported. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=519.66s)]
*  The president posting this morning, we don't have a free and fair press in this country [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=520.66s)]
*  anymore. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=525.18s)]
*  The president is a very good journalist that writes bad stories, cheats big on polls. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=526.3399999999999s)]
*  It is compromised and corrupt. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=530.3399999999999s)]
*  So which one of the two is it, Carlos? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=532.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, look, the president can dismiss these polls, Jose, but I can tell you that congressional [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=535.6999999999999s)]
*  Republicans are watching these polls very closely because they're up next, right? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=540.78s)]
*  They have to face voters in November. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=544.9399999999999s)]
*  And look, the president may dismiss the polls, but he also understands that he doesn't want [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=547.4599999999999s)]
*  Democrats in control of Congress. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=551.9799999999999s)]
*  He would like to continue advancing his agenda for as long as possible. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=554.7s)]
*  So, yes, this is standard. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=557.7s)]
*  Donald Trump dismissed the polls, counter whatever information is being put out there. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=559.7s)]
*  But at the end of the day, they do care about these polls. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=565.0200000000001s)]
*  They do adjust to them. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=567.98s)]
*  We certainly have seen that with the terror policy. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=569.1800000000001s)]
*  We have seen that with Doge and Elon Musk. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=571.94s)]
*  And I think the point you were making at the beginning is also very important. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=574.4200000000001s)]
*  A lot of these issues are issues where the administration is where the public is at, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=577.98s)]
*  or at least a majority of the public is at. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=583.58s)]
*  The problem they're having is how they are approaching these issues, whether it's immigration, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=585.86s)]
*  whether it's terror policy, or even these government reform efforts. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=591.34s)]
*  People support making government more efficient, but they want it to be done in a humane, coherent [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=595.1800000000001s)]
*  and predictable way. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=600.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II-zCvpUdTU&t=613.58s)]
