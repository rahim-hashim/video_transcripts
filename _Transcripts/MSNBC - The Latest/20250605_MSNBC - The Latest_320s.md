# Musk: 'Without me, Trump would have lost the election'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU)
*  Let's get back to the breaking news as this dispute between President Trump and Elon Musk [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=0.0s)]
*  gets worse seemingly by the hour. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=4.76s)]
*  Tesla shares are taking the brunt of it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=7.62s)]
*  Now, we want to remind folks, this comes less than an hour after Musk posted this. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  He argued that without him, Trump would have lost the election in November. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=16.1s)]
*  There it is, this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=21.52s)]
*  Without me, Trump would have lost the election. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=22.7s)]
*  Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51 to 49 in the Senate. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=24.42s)]
*  Such ingratitude. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=30.3s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't like that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=33.5s)]
*  He said, I would have won Pennsylvania regardless of Elon. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=35.06s)]
*  I'm very disappointed with Elon. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=37.46s)]
*  David Drucker is back with me. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=40.06s)]
*  David, Teddy Schleifer, who's a reporter who covers Musk and other billionaires for the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  New York Times, I think he was just on the show yesterday, tweeted, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=47.74s)]
*  RIP, the relationship between the tech right and Donald Trump. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=51.26s)]
*  What is the fallout from all of this? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=56.099999999999994s)]
*  Do you think where does this all go from here? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=57.82s)]
*  Well, it depends. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=59.9s)]
*  I mean, look, there's plenty of donor money out there and Republicans can raise small [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=61.26s)]
*  dollar money. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=66.82s)]
*  So, you know, we'll have to see what the long term impact of this is. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=67.82s)]
*  It's unclear that Musk was decisive in the 2024 election. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=71.38s)]
*  I mean, there were issues like inflation and border security that sent voters, you know, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=74.46s)]
*  shifting to the right across all demographics and just about all demographics. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=79.58s)]
*  I think what's interesting here is that as innovative and successful as Elon Musk is [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=85.9s)]
*  as a businessman, he seems to be rather politically naive. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=91.1s)]
*  The Republican Party and Donald Trump, neither of them really campaigned on bringing the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=95.78s)]
*  federal debt under control. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=102.66s)]
*  They didn't campaign on entitlement reform. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=104.74s)]
*  They didn't campaign on across the board tax increases. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=106.78s)]
*  They've talked about waste, fraud and abuse, which anybody who follows budgeting knows [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=109.74s)]
*  you should get rid of, but it's nowhere near. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=113.78s)]
*  I mean, it's like a drop in the bucket when it comes to dealing with a $37 trillion debt. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=116.22s)]
*  And so if he thought that the Department of Government efficiency or discretionary spending [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=122.02s)]
*  cuts was going to get it done, then he didn't understand the budget. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=126.54s)]
*  And he also apparently didn't understand that political loyalty with President Trump runs [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=130.14s)]
*  one way. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=134.08s)]
*  The way it's good for Trump and not necessarily good for everybody else involved. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=135.16s)]
*  It's just the way he is. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=138.92s)]
*  And if Musk would have done his homework, he might have realized that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=141.6s)]
*  Yeah, or maybe you think that you're going to be the exception to the rule because you've [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=144.96s)]
*  been so successful your whole life. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=148.44s)]
*  That's for books to be written in the future. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=151.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's naive. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  I want to bring in Phil LeBeau, who covers the auto industry for CNBC. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  Last time I looked, Tesla shares were down 8 percent. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=159.42s)]
*  And in addition to that, when Donald Trump tweeted that he was very disappointed in Elon, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=162.36s)]
*  he said he knew this bill better than anyone and he only developed a problem with it when [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  he found out I would cut the EV mandate. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  Oh, those gentlemen are going back and forth. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  What do you make of this scorched earth approach? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=181.44000000000003s)]
*  Well I can tell you this much. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=186.28000000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk made it very clear early on in the Trump administration that if the EV mandate [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  was eliminated, Tesla would be okay with that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  And the general feeling on Wall Street was that Tesla, of all the automakers, could live [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  without the EV tax incentives, at least the consumer one, the $7,500 incentive, because [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=204.98s)]
*  it had the greatest scale. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  In other words, other automakers really trying to get their EV business going needed that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=214.0s)]
*  mandate or that tax credit more than Tesla. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=220.52s)]
*  And so Tesla would be okay without it being a part of any future bill, which is the case [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=223.92s)]
*  now. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=229.92s)]
*  So that was clear, Chris. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  This is not a surprise. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=232.74s)]
*  This is not like Elon Musk just woke up today and said, wait a second, the EV tax credit [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=233.88s)]
*  is going away? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=239.04s)]
*  They knew about it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=240.18s)]
*  He knew about it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=241.18s)]
*  And so that element of this back and forth between Elon Musk and President Trump, that's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=242.6s)]
*  ridiculous. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=247.96s)]
*  This has been out there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=249.26s)]
*  It's been known for some time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=250.32s)]
*  Now maybe Elon Musk has now decided, wasn't really crazy about the idea of getting rid [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=252.28s)]
*  of it, and he has changed his tune. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=257.56s)]
*  That's always a possibility. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=260.32s)]
*  But let's just be clear about that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  This is not a surprise. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=264.2s)]
*  And I don't know if you have it in front of you, but why is Tesla still down around nine [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=266.88s)]
*  points or so? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=269.92s)]
*  Phil? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=272.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's down about nine percent. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=273.92s)]
*  But let's be clear here. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=274.92s)]
*  It's not just because of this back and forth with President Trump. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=276.16s)]
*  There are a lot of issues swirling around Tesla in terms of EV demand, whether or not [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=279.32000000000005s)]
*  they're positioned in the world to fight off the competition in China, as well as the growth [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=285.76000000000005s)]
*  of Chinese EV automakers around the world and especially in Europe. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  All of those are swirling around Tesla shares right now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oh_WNAYchU&t=296.16s)]
