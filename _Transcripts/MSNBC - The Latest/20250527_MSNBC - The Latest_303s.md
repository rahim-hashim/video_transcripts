# King Charles delivers pointed message in Canada amid Trump’s 51st state talks
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU)
*  Without having to say anything explicitly, King Charles delivered a pointed message to the president today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=0.0s)]
*  Canada has a long history with the British monarchy, distinct from the U.S., as Trump publicly pushes Canada as the 51st state. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=6.3s)]
*  The King's trip to the opening of Canada's parliament is the first by a British monarch in nearly 50 years, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=15.3s)]
*  and is widely seen as pushback against Trump's calls for annexation. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=21.5s)]
*  The speech he delivered today was written by Prime Minister Mark Carney, who has previously told Trump, Canada is not for sale. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=26.099999999999998s)]
*  Today, Canada faces another critical moment. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=34.9s)]
*  Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=39.8s)]
*  and ones which the government is determined to protect. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=51.0s)]
*  All Canadians can give themselves far more than any foreign power on any continent can ever take away. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=54.4s)]
*  And that by staying true to Canadian values, Canada can build new alliances and a new economy that serves all Canadians. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=64.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Ashley Parker, staff writer at The Atlantic and an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=74.4s)]
*  Charles is somebody who doesn't usually get involved in controversial news of the day, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=79.4s)]
*  but he certainly did seem to be sending a loud message to President Trump. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  How do you think the president, who has expressed a fondness for the royal family in the past, likely to view this, do you think? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  Well, it's tricky, you're right, because President Trump has expressed a fondness that dates back to his mother. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=97.4s)]
*  Who felt very strongly an admiration for the Queen. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=103.9s)]
*  You know, Trump was there for a state visit during his first term. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=109.30000000000001s)]
*  King Charles, quite sadly, diplomatically invited him very early on to return for a second state visit this term. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  What's interesting is it's very clear what King Charles is doing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  It's a quite pointed diplomatic message, but in its own way, it's rather subtle. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=127.2s)]
*  In the sense that he never, it is subtle compared to our president, right? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=133.3s)]
*  Who writes all caps through social posts. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=137.0s)]
*  He did not mention President Trump by name. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  He did not mention the very clear undercurrents of tariffs and, you know, talked about annexation or making Canada a 51st state. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=143.5s)]
*  So I think there is a world where if President Trump chooses to, he can sort of ignore this and not weigh in. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  But that doesn't necessarily mean he will have the discipline or self-control to refrain. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=161.5s)]
*  Well, I know you talked to the president when he said he was delighted to have influenced Canada's election, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=166.9s)]
*  which was widely seen as being driven by anti-Trump sentiment. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=172.70000000000002s)]
*  Is there anything in your conversations that suggests he would be willing to back off on these 51st state taunts? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=176.9s)]
*  I mean, he seems to be the one who is taking it seriously and not pretty much anybody else. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=184.6s)]
*  That's right. It was fascinating. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=192.4s)]
*  We kind of put that to him actually in our interview with him in the Oval Office. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=193.6s)]
*  We said Canada came up and he mentioned Canada becoming a 51st state and we said surely you're not serious. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  And he said, oh, I absolutely am, which struck me as kind of surprising because it felt like this all began as kind of good nature trolling. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=204.29999999999998s)]
*  And then we pointed out to him, you know, Republicans do not want, for instance, Washington, D.C. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=212.6s)]
*  or Puerto Rico to become states because they would be Democratic voting states in the electoral college and sending members to Congress. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=217.7s)]
*  We pointed out what Canada would be a huge Democratic state. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=226.1s)]
*  And Trump said he didn't care. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=230.3s)]
*  And again, that's when it came up that when he sort of got involved and became an inadvertent player in the Canadian elections, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=232.1s)]
*  he kind of boasted that he had swung the elections 25 points to the to the Liberal Party, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=239.0s)]
*  which again is not his party, is not the party where he agrees on policy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  But that seemed beside the point. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=250.4s)]
*  He seems kind of proud just to have played such an outsized role. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=252.0s)]
*  So I will say he does continue to say this, but of all the things he says, he doesn't seem to have real passion or oomph behind it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=256.0s)]
*  And there's very little talk that we've been able to discern behind the scenes with AIDS of just how he plans to make our neighbor to the north a 51st state. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=266.1s)]
*  So he said he's understood. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=275.9s)]
*  It seems quite unlikely still. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=277.4s)]
*  Ashley Parker, always good to have you on the show. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=279.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=281.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KySDFTkN4fU&t=296.0s)]
