# Trump's First 100 Days: Border, immigration policies face legal challenges
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM)
*  With us now NBC News senior White House correspondent Gabe Gutierrez, NBC News homeland security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=0.0s)]
*  correspondent Julie Ainsley and Veronica Cardenas, former assistant chief counsel for U.S. immigration [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=5.5s)]
*  and customs enforcement. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=10.24s)]
*  So Gabe, on immigration, the president has a lot he can point to. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=11.8s)]
*  Yeah, Jose, good morning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=15.36s)]
*  The Trump administration has been pointing out what you just alluded to, that illegal [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=17.76s)]
*  border crossings are at a record low and they have been since President Trump took office. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=21.92s)]
*  Now ICE arrests have also been significantly higher throughout the country. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=28.08s)]
*  Deportations though, however, have lagged slightly behind the Biden administration during [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  the same period last year, but the administration is quick to point out the reason that is, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=38.64s)]
*  is because illegal border crossings have been so low that during the Biden administration, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=43.16s)]
*  some of those deportations, many of them in fact, were actually migrants that had come [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  over the border in Mexico, been encountered by border patrol and then immediately deported. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=53.16s)]
*  So that's why deportations are actually slightly lower. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=57.64s)]
*  Now more undocumented immigrants are being deported from the interior of the country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=61.36s)]
*  Now, Caroline Levitt, the White House press secretary, tried to sell some of those accomplishments [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=66.56s)]
*  yesterday as the administration neared the mark of its first 100 days. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=70.6s)]
*  Listen. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=75.6s)]
*  America's borders are now secure because of President Trump. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=76.6s)]
*  He has restored the rule of law, enforced our immigration laws and defended America's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=83.82s)]
*  sovereignty. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  The president immediately declared a national emergency on the southern border, deployed [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=89.72s)]
*  the U.S. military and border patrol to repel the invasion and ended reckless catch and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=93.66s)]
*  release policies. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=98.58s)]
*  The results have been nothing short of extraordinary. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=99.96s)]
*  Now even though illegal border crossings are at a record low, the administration still [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=104.46s)]
*  says that it will continue to recognize this as a national emergency. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=107.97999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, critics of the administration have been pointing out that what they see [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=112.06s)]
*  as an erosion of due process as these deportations have ramped up, Jose. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=116.46000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Julia, the border has been transformed with crossings dropping to record lows, but [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=121.26s)]
*  there also have been legal challenges to his border and immigration policies. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=125.34s)]
*  What has been the impact of these legal challenges? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=129.62s)]
*  Yeah, actually, Jose, there's a hearing just today at two o'clock in D.C. about Trump's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=132.3s)]
*  use of a 212-F authority. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=137.58s)]
*  That's what he used to basically shut down the entire system for applying for asylum [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=139.86s)]
*  at the U.S. border. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=144.5s)]
*  As you know, President Biden made it virtually impossible for anyone to claim asylum if they [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=145.5s)]
*  cross the border illegally. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=150.06s)]
*  Then Trump shut down asylum pathways for those who were crossing legally and presenting themselves [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=151.94000000000003s)]
*  at ports of entry to try to say that they had a fear of returning to their home country. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=157.14000000000001s)]
*  That's being challenged in court. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=162.84s)]
*  That's been one of the more slow-moving legal challenges. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=164.12s)]
*  I think we've been talking a lot more about his ICE policies and what he's been doing [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=167.1s)]
*  to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, of course, when it comes to sending those alleged members [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=171.18s)]
*  of Trinidad, Aragua, and MS-13 to El Salvador. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=175.38s)]
*  But the border really has had a drastic drop. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=178.38s)]
*  Fewer people are coming. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=183.22s)]
*  Smugglers have even told Gabe here how their revenue has been driving up just because there [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=184.22s)]
*  are fewer people even coming to the border to attempt to cross. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=190.42s)]
*  So of course, that message has gone out. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=193.7s)]
*  But it's true. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=195.74s)]
*  The number of people who are coming to the border is growing. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=197.38s)]
*  And the number of people who are coming to the border is growing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=200.38s)]
*  And the number of people who are coming to the border is growing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=203.38s)]
*  And the number of people who are coming to the border is growing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=206.38s)]
*  And the number of people who are coming to the border is growing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=209.38s)]
*  And the number of people who are coming to the border is growing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=212.38s)]
*  And the number of people who are coming to the border is growing. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=215.38s)]
*  And the number of people who are coming to the border is growing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=218.38s)]
*  And the number of people who are coming to the border is growing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=221.38s)]
*  I mean, the numbers, and we were talking about in years past, 30, 35,000 people crossing [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  maybe in one day, down to 2,000. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=232.01999999999998s)]
*  But the numbers have changed so drastically. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=235.01999999999998s)]
*  There's been a lot of cost to pay for those numbers dropping. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  How do you see these 100 days? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  I see these 100 days, and I want to compare it to his first administration. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  It was still under working in the immigration courts at the time. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  And his play in the first administration was to really bring people into the immigration courts, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=252.66s)]
*  hire more judges, fire older judges that weren't ruling in his favor. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=256.66s)]
*  And it was chaos, essentially, in the immigration courts at that time, because there were just [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=260.66s)]
*  so many people that we were at capacity at that point. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=265.66s)]
*  Now his strategy has shifted so that people don't, to bypass the courts entirely. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=268.66s)]
*  And so everything that we have seen has made it easier for this administration to quickly [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=275.66s)]
*  deport people. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=282.3s)]
*  We have seen many administrative errors, as prior government lawyers have termed the word, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=283.3s)]
*  people who have been deported who weren't supposed to be deported. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=290.3s)]
*  So in this rush to deport, as you previously stated, three United States citizen children [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=293.3s)]
*  were detained and then deported with their mothers. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=298.3s)]
*  And issues like that are just going to continue to happen. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=303.3s)]
*  I don't think that it's a surprise that his poll numbers are lower in immigration, because [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=307.94s)]
*  people are seeing right through this strategy, and they're not liking what they're seeing. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=312.94s)]
*  I don't think I have so much to talk to you about. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=317.94s)]
*  But, you know, and the issue of U.S.-born children not being deported, but actually [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=319.94s)]
*  being sent to their mother's home countries when those mothers are being deported leaves [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=324.94s)]
*  a lot of questions, right? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=331.94s)]
*  Those children have the right to stay or to leave or to come back, but it shouldn't [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=333.58s)]
*  be in the American government's purview whether they stay or go, because they're U.S. citizens. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=338.58s)]
*  But the immigration system in our country has been irrevocably broken for decades now. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=345.58s)]
*  And I'm thinking of the backlog that there is in immigration courts for the millions [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=352.58s)]
*  of people who are waiting for their opportunity to go in front of a judge and claim asylum. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  There's also the 1.1 million people whose cases have already been adjudicated, and those [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=366.21999999999997s)]
*  are still in limbo. Is there anything that you think could make a difference in a broken [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=374.21999999999997s)]
*  immigration system that it seems is both Republican and Democrats that have been a part of that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=382.82s)]
*  evolving, eroding system? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=390.5s)]
*  Right, and I think the issue there is asylum. Asylum is often claimed because people do [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=391.5s)]
*  fear harm, but they don't plan to stay forever. And so having something that recognizes that, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=398.5s)]
*  that people sometimes, there's economic hardships, there's natural disasters that happen in other [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=406.5s)]
*  countries, and so allowing people to come here to work and then return, programs like [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=412.5s)]
*  that have been successful in the past. A lot of those programs no longer exist. And [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=416.5s)]
*  so asylum sometimes becomes the only type of relief that people in this country have. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=421.5s)]
*  Also, as the Biden administration tried and it was stopped, having people who have been [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=429.5s)]
*  in the U.S. for over 10 years, who are married to U.S. citizens, who have U.S. citizen children, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=434.9s)]
*  don't have a way to legalize their status right now. And so seeing where are the pockets [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=440.1s)]
*  that we can speak to and to legalize people in those areas. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=446.14s)]
*  Dave, what do we know about the president's executive orders that he's going to sign today? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=450.7s)]
*  Well, Jose, yesterday the president did sign executive orders related to immigration, including [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=457.7s)]
*  one requiring a list of so-called sanctuary cities to be provided to him. Of course, the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=464.97999999999996s)]
*  president has long railed against what he refers to as Democrat-led sanctuary cities [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=472.58000000000004s)]
*  that don't cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. But he also signed an executive [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=477.94s)]
*  order yesterday seeking to, in the administration's view, bolster local police departments, including [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=484.54s)]
*  giving police officers more resources when it came to legal challenges, unjust expenses [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=491.54s)]
*  as they see it, for official duties and also allowing more surplus military assets to be [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=497.62s)]
*  used in local law enforcement. Jose, the president in his first hundred days signed many executive [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=504.29999999999995s)]
*  orders, many more so than actual laws that he signed, only about five laws or so that [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=510.9s)]
*  he signed. But he has really ramped up his use of executive power, Jose. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=516.1s)]
*  And Julia, meanwhile, tomorrow the House Judiciary Committee is going to pick up its portion [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=519.8199999999999s)]
*  of that big bill focusing on the president's priorities. This portion focuses on immigration. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=523.9s)]
*  What do you know about this? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=529.86s)]
*  Well, of course, this is the first step in what's going to be a long process that I'm [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=530.98s)]
*  sure my Hill colleagues will be following more closely than I am. But I got a chance [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=534.74s)]
*  yesterday just to read through what Republicans on the House Judiciary have put forward in [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=538.1s)]
*  terms of what they would see as a budget over the next four years for ICE. And we can assume [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=543.26s)]
*  that these are lockstep in line with the Trump administration's priorities. They are talking [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=547.46s)]
*  about new fees, including a thousand dollar fee just to claim asylum and a hundred years, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=552.56s)]
*  a hundred dollars per year that the case is pending, having to file fifteen hundred dollars [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  just to change your legal status, to get a green card. And look at these at the bottom [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=563.88s)]
*  here, Jose, five thousand dollars for immigrants deported if they fail to show up for a hearing. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=568.3599999999999s)]
*  Of course, that can happen sometimes when there's an address change and five thousand [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQovxphoM&t=572.4399999999999s)]
