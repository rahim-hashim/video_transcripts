Video Description: President Trump's big agenda bill is facing some serious resistance from Republicans, especially after it was revealed the bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years, according to an estimate from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. That’s even without his new frenemy Elon Musk's opposition.

# ‘Republican math never works’: Former GOP Congressman slams Trump budget bill
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E)
*  President Trump's big old bill is facing some serious resistance from Republicans. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=0.0s)]
*  That's even without the cover of his new frenemy, Elon Musk's opposition. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=6.0s)]
*  Especially after it was revealed the bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=10.28s)]
*  over the next two years. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=17.3s)]
*  That was with a T, not a B or an M. That's according to an estimate from the nonpartisan [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=18.3s)]
*  Congressional Budget Office. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=22.6s)]
*  And nearly 11 million people will lose their health insurance by 2034 under the bill due [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  to spending cuts and Medicaid eligibility rules. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=29.64s)]
*  Now Trump told members of the Senate Finance Committee to just quote, pass the damn bill [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=32.96s)]
*  during a White House meeting this week to add even more fuel to the fire. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=37.2s)]
*  Elon Musk has already threatened to primary any politician who votes for the bill. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=41.56s)]
*  David Jollaway. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=46.8s)]
*  David Jollaway, David Jollaway, he was here a while later, are with us. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=47.8s)]
*  I put you guys together. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  That's what I wanted to do. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  You know, David, you have been in there, right? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=58.040000000000006s)]
*  You're one of the two speakers of the House, if I remember correctly. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=59.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=61.44s)]
*  This has to, they're going to do something here, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=62.44s)]
*  Talk about House bills, the sentence where the House bills go to die. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=65.72s)]
*  That has happened over and over and over again. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=69.48s)]
*  So what do you think is happening? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=71.88s)]
*  What do you think, you know, Thune is kind of concocting over there? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=73.8s)]
*  So winning is unifying and I suspect they'll find a way to unify my experience. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=77.44s)]
*  You know what I love about being a Democrat now? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=82.34s)]
*  We get to accept math and science and data. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=86.04s)]
*  Republican math never works. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=90.04s)]
*  Republican math never works. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  It was my lived experience in Congress. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  You know, I would cosponsor tax bills and actually vote against them because at the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=94.48s)]
*  end of the day on the floor the math never worked. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  They just kind of, they make it go away a little bit and I think that's what we're seeing here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=99.4s)]
*  I think we're also seeing what we already know, which is the Republican Party is not [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=104.04s)]
*  a party of fiscal responsibility. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=108.48s)]
*  It simply is not. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=110.4s)]
*  I mean, the Republican Party here is prepared to blow up the debt and deficit and then on [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=111.4s)]
*  the question of values, how are they looking to cut money out of Medicaid? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=115.68s)]
*  And look, generationally I think a lot of people of a certain age think of Medicaid [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=119.68s)]
*  as oh, that was only for certain socioeconomic communities. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=123.84s)]
*  Now in many states like Florida over 40% of childbirth care is provided by Medicaid. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=127.2s)]
*  Long-term care facilities, if you have a family member with dementia or in some type of long-term [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=132.52s)]
*  care facility, you know, what happens is when you run out of resources, Medicaid starts [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=137.4s)]
*  the tab. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=142.48s)]
*  And the special needs community, unique abilities community, largely supported by Medicaid and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=143.48s)]
*  Republicans can say it's not going to cut that, but that's not true. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=148.48s)]
*  That's absolutely not true and particularly in long-term care facilities, they're apparently [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  going to revoke a rule about the number of staff that's required in some of those facilities. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=155.88s)]
*  So I think we're seeing the perfect display of Republican values. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=160.83999999999997s)]
*  We're going to explode the debt and deficit. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=164.48s)]
*  We're going to use math that doesn't work and we're going to take away health care from [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  people who need it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  Go ahead and do it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=171.44s)]
*  It's wrong. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=172.44s)]
*  It's wrong, but you're going to be in a lot of trouble next November if you do it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=173.44s)]
*  David, let me stick with you because I just wonder if you think that Musk coming out so [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=175.24s)]
*  vociferously against the quote, unquote, the quote, big, beautiful bill, that that'll have [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=180.28s)]
*  any impact on its passage in the Senate. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=185.12s)]
*  Short question. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  Who are congressional Republicans more afraid of, President Trump or Elon Musk? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=189.44s)]
*  I think House Republicans are more afraid of Elon Musk. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=194.28s)]
*  I'm not sure Senate Republicans are as much. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=198.72s)]
*  For whatever reason, senators are just different. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=201.72s)]
*  They all think they're President of the United States. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=203.76s)]
*  They don't take threats pretty well. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=205.2s)]
*  But House members are terrified. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=206.92s)]
*  And if there's a primary threat by Elon Musk, look, let's be honest. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=208.76s)]
*  Most seats, 90% of our seats are either gerrymandered or naturally gerrymandered for one party. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  So if you're a Republican and Elon Musk is going to drop $5 million into a primary against [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=220.56s)]
*  you, you'll lose. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=225.72s)]
*  You'll lose. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=226.72s)]
*  If you're Donald Trump, you can navigate Trumpism a little bit. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=227.8s)]
*  But the Elon Musk threat is real. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=232.16s)]
*  There seems to be an opportunity for Democrats here, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=233.56s)]
*  You have Musk running around, this man with a humongous microphone, one that rivals Donald [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=235.92s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=240.12s)]
*  He has X, Twitter, whatever you want to call it, where a lot of Americans pay attention [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=241.12s)]
*  to and are getting a lot of news, quote, unquote, from. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=246.76s)]
*  He called it an abomination, this bill. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=250.6s)]
*  Is that an opportunity for Democrats to be like, yeah, it is an abomination. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=252.92s)]
*  We disagree about why, but here's why we think it's an abomination, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=255.72s)]
*  Does it give more attention to something that the Democrats are already trying to do? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=259.08s)]
*  Yeah, and they should speak out as loud about it as Senators Rand Paul, Johnson, Hawley. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=263.48s)]
*  I mean, Republican senators are being vocal about the fact that they are cautious and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=269.12s)]
*  hesitant about the bill. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=274.52s)]
*  And I think that Democrats should, they should pick up where a lot of the Republican senators [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=276.06s)]
*  are leaving off and say, yes. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=281.0s)]
*  And on top of that, Senator Lisa Murakowski should care about the fact that those energy [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=282.56s)]
*  tax credits greatly benefit Alaska and that cutting rural health care will damage Alaska. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=286.44s)]
*  And yes, I agree with Senator Josh Hawley that it is Medicaid cuts and we shouldn't [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=292.4s)]
*  be doing this to working class folks. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=296.2s)]
*  And for once in my life, I agree with Senator Rand Paul. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=298.12s)]
*  And let's look at the budget. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=300.28s)]
*  There are so many, Senator Mike Lee talking about limited government. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=302.32s)]
*  I mean, now is the time to put the pressure on them. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=308.0s)]
*  Like you said, David, senators are just not as concerned about threats coming from a president [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=311.08s)]
*  because they've got a lot longer of time to deal with sitting in that seat. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=316.0s)]
*  I'm a former Senate staffer myself. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=320.56s)]
*  And so yeah, I think the upper chamber has the upper hand. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=322.58s)]
*  Senators don't like to be pushed around. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=325.76s)]
*  House members get pushed around every single day of their lives. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=328.12s)]
*  Senators don't. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=331.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=332.52s)]
*  Senators don't like being pushed around. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=334.2s)]
*  And I'm doing that because I'm looking here because we have a breakdown of who the Republicans [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=335.91999999999996s)]
*  who are against the bill and, you know, under our heading here, concerned about Medicaid [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=340.08s)]
*  cuts, clean energy, tax credit, Medicaid cuts. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=346.88s)]
*  Senator Susan Collins of Maine, she's always concerned. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=350.24s)]
*  She's concerned about this. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=353.36s)]
*  She's concerned about that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=354.52s)]
*  But at the end of the day, more often than not, she votes for the thing. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=355.52s)]
*  She never misses the opportunity to do the wrong thing. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=359.96s)]
*  So senators don't like, excuse me, don't like to look like they are being pushed around. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=364.08s)]
*  And some of them reach for political cover and language to try to make it look like [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=368.52s)]
*  that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm more curious about those who have drawn a red line on the debt and the deficit and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  the numbers. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=376.96s)]
*  Does a Rand Paul ever move on this? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=377.96s)]
*  Does a real fiscal hawk ever move on this? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=379.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5DLfoPq4E&t=382.79999999999995s)]
