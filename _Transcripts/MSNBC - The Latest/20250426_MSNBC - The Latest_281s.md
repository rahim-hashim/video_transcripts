# ‘We're in this fight together’: Katie Phang closes out The Katie Phang Show
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ)
*  When I'm asked if there's a quote or a mantra by which I live and abide I often answer with this from Judy Garland [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Always be a first-rate version of yourself and not a second-rate version of someone else [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Since the beginning of the Katie fang show [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=13.08s)]
*  I have brought my true and authentic self to each and every episode [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  The goal was to go deeper in the analysis to be more thoughtful about the conversations [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=18.68s)]
*  To empower you with the knowledge so you could feel even more invested in the issues [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=23.56s)]
*  Knowledge is power and I wanted you to feel like you were armed with the right tools to tackle [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=29.08s)]
*  What was coming your way and you could share that knowledge with others, especially when it came to the law [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=34.8s)]
*  The show could not have happened without the hard work and dedication of so many talented and amazing individuals with whom I've been blessed to work [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=40.64s)]
*  I'd like to highlight though my current team though. We may be small [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  We are mighty and the things we have been able to pull off have been simply [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  Incredible the Katie fang show team has worked tirelessly every week to bring you content that is thought-provoking at times [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  Emotional and always of the highest standard of excellence [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=63.72s)]
*  We've shared laughs and tears along the way and that's only served to make this journey together that much better [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  My gratitude to that team cannot be measured because they will always be family to me a [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=74.12s)]
*  Recurring theme in my show has been accountability speaking truth to power sometimes more bluntly than others [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=81.3s)]
*  But it was always paramount to me that I bring transparency to the issues [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=87.74s)]
*  I often say that I traffic in the currency of facts and evidence [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=91.86s)]
*  truth not lies [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  proof not mere argument [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=99.38s)]
*  I am [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  Expended to the core by the lies and the repeated attempts to gaslight Americans when it comes to critical [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=102.86s)]
*  issues that impact so many of us and so when given the privilege of this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=109.86s)]
*  Platform of a show by the way with my distinctly Asian name on it [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=115.46s)]
*  I embrace the honor of being able to be a voice for so many of you [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=120.2s)]
*  When it came to demanding that the right thing is being done and when it's not that there's a call for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=124.9s)]
*  Accountability by those responsible each and every week. I fought for the truth to be told and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=131.46s)]
*  Now that my time here at MSNBC comes to a close. I am taking that fight back to a familiar place [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=138.5s)]
*  I'm proud to let you know that I'll be joining [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=146.74s)]
*  Norm Eisen and others in their pursuit of justice on behalf of some incredible organizations like the State Democracy Defenders Fund [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=148.98s)]
*  I'll be back in the courtroom fighting for democracy in the arena where some of the fiercest battles are being waged and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=156.78s)]
*  Just like I did here at the Katy fang show [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=163.78s)]
*  I'll be demanding accountability by those in power to prevent the further destruction of our great country [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=165.86s)]
*  For centuries countless Americans have fought for our rights that are currently being trampled by this administration [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=171.46s)]
*  Justice will be sought. I hope you'll follow along with me as I continue to meet you where you are at places like [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=178.0s)]
*  Substack and YouTube with fellow truth-tellers like Midas touch and the contrarian and you'll see me back here [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=184.56s)]
*  On the other side of the desk as a guest joining the amazing anchors and hosts at MSNBC [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=192.2s)]
*  Do you believe in signs? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=198.0s)]
*  Because I do just last night out of the blue a dear family friend texted me a photograph of a letter that my late father [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=199.68s)]
*  Sent to him in 1997 April 16 1997 almost 28 years to the day [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=206.28s)]
*  I had never seen it before in his unique handwriting my dad quoted an old Asian proverb [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=212.68s)]
*  Live each day so that you will neither be afraid of tomorrow nor ashamed of yesterday. I [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=221.32s)]
*  Know my father sent me this message as I close one chapter and I embark on a new one [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=229.12s)]
*  I am proud of the work. I have done here [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=234.32s)]
*  I am NOT ashamed of the work I have done and I am NOT afraid of what is to come tomorrow [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=237.12s)]
*  Because I know that we are in this fight together [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=243.04s)]
*  That does it for me for now, thank you all for joining us today and every day [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=249.08s)]
*  But don't go anywhere [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=254.96s)]
*  MSNBC reports with Alex wit coming up next [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=257.04s)]
*  You [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2S3eCDlqEQ&t=267.0s)]
