# What we know about Leo XIV, the new American pope
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM)
*  You know a lot of folks don't know I was an Augustinian seminarian for three years of my life wore the habit of the order for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=0.0s)]
*  brief time and for me [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=6.94s)]
*  To know that and I had just been reading about him in one of the Augustinian [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=10.18s)]
*  Magazines that goes around they were did a profile on him and talking about him. And so that moment was like wow that connection [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=14.94s)]
*  to the order and to the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=23.66s)]
*  The [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Narrative of August of st. Augustine who was a badass, you know, he's just a bad boy [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  I mean, he just he was of the world in so many ways [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=32.32s)]
*  and so now you have the vicar of Christ who is also in continuing in continuation of that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=35.8s)]
*  legacy of both Augustine and Francis of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=43.6s)]
*  Bringing the message of Christ directly to people so that for me was a very powerful moment watching him there with that smile [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=47.64s)]
*  But then starting with the words, you know, you know peace [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=54.94s)]
*  To all of us which is kind of a wonderful thing and there were so many special moments [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=59.86s)]
*  As you said you couldn't help but think of st. Augustine you couldn't help but think of the late Pope Francis [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=64.22s)]
*  But with his name, of course, you couldn't help but think of Pope Leo, which is another beautiful theme today [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=68.9s)]
*  Pope Leo is of course the founder of kind of Catholic social thought and gave us the famous encyclical rear of Navarra which really [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=73.82s)]
*  Advocated for workers and just working conditions and was both critical of socialism, but also laissez-faire capitalism [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  So it's really a kind of nod to in a time of really socio-economic inequality around the world [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  Finding a way to kind of come together around common morals to support those on the margins of society [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=93.36s)]
*  seven months before [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=98.2s)]
*  Pope Leo became Pope Leo. He was a cardinal pre-vost and in English [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=100.56s)]
*  He talked about what a bishop is called to do at the time again. This is seven months before becoming the Pope [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=106.36s)]
*  I don't know if we have the video or I can read the audio [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=111.22s)]
*  I'm gonna read it. Oh, we have it. Okay, let's play it [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=114.94s)]
*  It's not supposed to be a little prince sitting in his kingdom [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=119.22s)]
*  But rather called authentically to to be humble to be close to the people he serves to walk with them [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=123.94s)]
*  To suffer with them and to look for ways that he can better live the gospel message in the midst of his people [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=131.02s)]
*  That was then Cardinal pre-vost and now today [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=137.86s)]
*  Newly elected Pope Leo he called on Catholics to be a missionary church that receives everyone take a listen [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=142.26000000000002s)]
*  How we can together be a missionary church a church that builds bridges [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=153.3s)]
*  Reciever a that is always open to receive [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=160.86s)]
*  Everyone just like in this square to receive everyone's welcome everyone [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=165.3s)]
*  Our charity our dialogue and love [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  First a pope fluent in all the languages languages, but also I mean the roots of the church a missionary church [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=175.1s)]
*  What did you take from his comments seven months before juxtaposed with what he said today? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=184.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, let's talk about what we just saw and what he said because I think both are important here [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=189.14s)]
*  You hear him talking in this this way that's very resonant of Francis [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=193.33999999999997s)]
*  Pope Francis talked about how the church needed to be a church that was a missionary [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=196.88s)]
*  Field hospital church one that was actually amongst the people so when he stepped out today on that loja [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=200.44s)]
*  You kind of heard the remnants of Pope Francis, but if you look at him and what he's wearing right there [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=205.0s)]
*  It's kind of reminiscent of Benedict. That's a very similar to the mozette of the kind of red draping around [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=209.64s)]
*  It was similar to what Pope Benedict walked out on so I think that sends a couple interesting signals about [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=214.32s)]
*  This papacy on one hand [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=219.2s)]
*  I think that he will keep up the tenor and tone that was very reminiscent of Francis [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=221.0s)]
*  But I think the look and feel of it will have pieces that remind you of Pope Benedict [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=225.55999999999997s)]
*  This pope is someone who really understands the curia or the folks who kind of run the church [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=229.6s)]
*  He's an institutionalist in a way that Pope Francis certainly wasn't so in many ways. This is the best of both worlds [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  Everybody who's looking for something can find it in this pope we were in the run-up to the conclave [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=239.56s)]
*  I read a piece by a Catholic editor who said like this isn't the Iowa caucuses [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=244.42s)]
*  Giving their stuff being on the stump and yet it is inherently [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=251.11999999999998s)]
*  Political both the process that happens internally and the backdrop that is set against [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=256.76s)]
*  Well one of the things that can kill you in this is if you're seen as campaigning for it [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  That really hurts you and on top of that one of the things when you're seen as the front-runner [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  There can come out criticisms or critiques that might hurt you when you ultimately go into conclave [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=270.38s)]
*  So that critical week in between is really important to follow [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=274.88s)]
*  I think that in the last few days you've kind of started hearing his name [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=277.56s)]
*  But he was certainly not on the short list that we were talking about a week ago [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=281.04s)]
*  No, he wasn't on the short list and I think that that's that's what's so profoundly important about his [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=283.58s)]
*  Election was again like Francis who was not on anyone's list [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=290.34s)]
*  The cardinals as Catholics believe through the Holy Spirit, you know with them [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=295.8s)]
*  Saw the need of the church and you you talked about institutionalism. I was noted [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=303.12s)]
*  something from [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=310.2s)]
*  The National Catholic Reporter which you write for from time to time [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=311.76s)]
*  In February he shared a post the Pope then Cardinal from the media outlet National Catholic Reporter repeating the headline [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  JD Vance is wrong. Jesus doesn't asked to rank [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=323.16s)]
*  Our love for others in which a writer rebuts the vice president's claim in a Fox News interview [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=327.58000000000004s)]
*  That Christians prioritize loving people close to them before those from other countries [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=334.54s)]
*  You have this Pope who? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=341.26000000000005s)]
*  As a cardinal was not afraid to push back up against the things that as a Catholic [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=343.78000000000003s)]
*  We should know better JD [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=351.18s)]
*  and and as as you know, I guess [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=354.02s)]
*  Where the politics of the world is not just the US but where the politics of the world is [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=358.56s)]
*  always mindful of that there you can't put a price a label or a priority on love and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=364.48s)]
*  That's I think it's gonna be interesting to watch how he translates that [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=373.02s)]
*  Into other aspects on issues like immigration how we treat the migrant how we feed the poor how we take care of those who? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=377.54s)]
*  Dispossessed how do you see this papacy? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=385.38s)]
*  Standing up politically in this global space. Well, the Cardinals certainly took the same approach [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=389.38s)]
*  To carrying out the legacy of Pope Francis in this way. I suspect that this will be a pope who was a pastor first [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=395.14000000000004s)]
*  So rather than starting from a place of criticism, I think he will aim to start from a place of inclusion [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=400.18s)]
*  Politically, I think that there are a lot of people today who are trying to jump in and say well he criticized JD Vance [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=405.23999999999995s)]
*  Therefore he must be a liberal [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  But the important thing to remember is that the Catholic Church's ideology doesn't fit neatly into any political box [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  So yes, he was critical of JD Vance on issues like immigration [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=416.44s)]
*  But I suspect that in time, you know issues that are typically seen as progressive or democratic such as abortion [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=420.32s)]
*  You will see them carry out the teachings of the church there [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=426.12s)]
*  So, you know a pope is there to carry out the full breadth of Catholic social teaching [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=428.84s)]
*  The thing that Pope Francis was so good about that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=433.12s)]
*  I suspect Pope Leo will be very good at too is reorienting towards the times [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=435.06s)]
*  Talking about social inequality talking about things like climate change talking about things like immigration and in a church that is global and [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=439.02s)]
*  Is the church both for America but for Africa and Latin America and Asia? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=445.58s)]
*  That would be an important message that needs to cross all of those societies [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=450.06s)]
*  You [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwfyS3a8ZM&t=463.12s)]
