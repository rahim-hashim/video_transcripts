Video Description: According to a brand new NBC News Decision Desk Poll out this morning, 64% of Americans oppose the use of government funds for the parade. Meanwhile, in very different scenes playing out across the country, organizers are staging protests in hundreds of cities and towns in what they are calling a nationwide day of defiance. The protests come during a week of heightened tensions over President Trump's immigration raids, a week that saw Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California forcibly removed from DHS Sec. Kristi Noem's press conference on Thursday.

*  that want to protest they're going to be met with very big force and I haven't even heard about a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  protest but you know this is people that hate our country but they will be met with very heavy force. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=155.84s)]
*  Max he's talking about people who just show up and exercise their right under the constitution [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=164.0s)]
*  to freedom of speech freedom of expression. American citizens most of course. Of course it's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  amazing he didn't have that same opinion in regards to January 6th protesters but you know [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=175.84s)]
*  we can't look at this military parade in a silo right this is not a conversation about whether or [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=181.84s)]
*  not we're celebrating the army. I've given a big chunk of my life to the army I love the U.S. Army [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=188.32s)]
*  but there's actually a technical term for what is happening today and it's not a parade it's a show [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  of force and that's a technical military term you could celebrate the army which is some simple [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=201.04s)]
*  soldiers walking down Pennsylvania Avenue you don't need the tanks you don't need the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  striker vehicles you don't need the artillery equipment and who is the audience for that show [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=211.52s)]
*  for certainly people will be viewing it globally but also protesters peaceful protesters United [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=217.44s)]
*  States citizens protesting standing up for their constitutional rights throughout the nation and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  that's the problem Donald Trump doesn't look at the enemy abroad he's looking at his political [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=229.44s)]
*  opponents here at home as his enemy. Mr. Robinson because I can't call you Eugene [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=235.28s)]
*  call me Gene. It's too Eugene we'll go there. You know one of the things that has been kind of nagging at me and I [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=241.68s)]
*  think you know the congressman spoke to it really well about this domestic audience one of the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=248.24s)]
*  reasons that the military officials the folks in the Pentagon his advisors did not want him doing [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=252.64s)]
*  this in the first term is in their words is that this is what dictators do right other than Bastille [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=258.72s)]
*  Day which is where he kind of got the idea this is not something we see in in democracies right [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=264.32s)]
*  because the audience is the domestic audience when we see this happening in North Korea that is [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=269.12s)]
*  because Kim Jong-un is telling the folks of his country this is who I have this is what could [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=275.04s)]
*  happen to you exactly they stage a hell of a parade in North Korea also in China every 10 years [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=282.32s)]
*  they do a you know hundreds of thousands of people these are shows of force as Bach said they're [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=287.44s)]
*  absolutely and this is so antithetical to the way the army was founded you know 250 years ago [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=293.52s)]
*  it was it was founded by the second continental congress after Lexington and conquered reluctantly [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=303.12s)]
*  the first continental congress had not wanted a standing army but they said okay well we need a [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=310.24s)]
*  standing army because the British are indeed coming but but they did it you know the the whole [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=316.0s)]
*  sense of what they were trying to do is we're not we're not like Britain we're not going to have [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=322.72s)]
*  this sort of overweening army that is a that is a is a factor in our political life we're not going [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  to use it that way we're going to use it for our defense and and ultimately for our independence [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  it's this is not what we do as a country and we're doing it today okay I want to play devil's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=344.0s)]
*  advocate here oh the devil don't need no lawyer yeah right exactly right he's got plenty working [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=350.48s)]
*  overtime uh so I in general one of my most controversial opinions is that I you know I [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=356.64000000000004s)]
*  don't like ceremonial I think cemeteries are a lot of good real estate in a lot of cities like I'm [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=362.8s)]
*  not one for like the ceremonial necessarily okay so I'm saying so I'm saying that just to say [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=368.16s)]
*  but are we missing the point here and we're letting you know what's happening with Trump [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=376.16s)]
*  overcome what should be a celebration of the U.S. military and there are 7 000 troops that have to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=382.48s)]
*  go they have orders today of course so what is the balance between recognizing that this is [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=388.72s)]
*  politicized that this is a waste of taxpayer dollars which I just said cemeteries like you're [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=394.64s)]
*  not you don't have to talk to you know me over here about wasting taxpayer dollars but how do [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=400.16s)]
*  we still support the troops but to be clear there there this it isn't happening in a style like you [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=404.96s)]
*  said none of this is happening in a vacuum you have the president of the United States this was [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=411.76s)]
*  planned right we all knew this was coming the military was always going to do something for the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=416.23999999999995s)]
*  200 exactly the other plans but in February they changed their plans because they knew that Donald [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  Trump wanted this and the folks in the Pentagon Hexeth and his team made those changes now I'm a [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  military brat I'm an army man my dad was military intelligence for 21 years I was in Fort Bragg [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=432.24s)]
*  twice both my siblings were there we bounced around everywhere so I am pro-military I'm pro [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=438.0s)]
*  the army I'm a fan right it has been a part of my life the thing is you can do that without having [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=442.56s)]
*  this happen while in LA you have the marines there right Donald Trump knew when he had on this [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=449.2s)]
*  Saturday was going to have this parade that there was going to be a problem when he sent the marines [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=455.52s)]
*  right if that wasn't happening right people still have an issue with it but the fact that it's all [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=462.16s)]
*  happening at the same time is the problem a thousand percent you could responsible leadership [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=467.12s)]
*  would involve a president a commander in chief who sees the entire chessboard and understands [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  that we're living in a moment right now of unprecedented tension that he himself catalyzed [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=479.52000000000004s)]
*  and this is the moment where you don't want to exacerbate those tensions with this massive [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=486.16s)]
*  unprecedented show of force but rather try to bring the country together and you don't do that [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=491.68s)]
*  by rolling tanks down Pennsylvania Avenue speaking of tensions that the president is stoking this [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  isn't new what the president is doing his his rhetoric let's play what Donald Trump has said [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  over the years in terms of his rhetoric and the violence that he seems to condone through his [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=513.28s)]
*  rhetoric do you know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=519.92s)]
*  they'd be carried out on a stretcher folks [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=525.4399999999999s)]
*  that's true honestly I hate to see that here's a guy throwing punches nasty as hell screaming [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=530.4s)]
*  and everything else when we're talking and he walking out and we're not allowed you know the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=536.3199999999999s)]

*  him in the face I'll tell you so if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=546.24s)]
*  knock the crap out of him would you seriously okay just knock the hell I promise you I will [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=550.8s)]

*  look it also strikes me that this military parade this army parade is Donald Trump's [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=580.64s)]
*  personality incarnate remember this is a draft dodger this is a guy who dodged the draft five [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=584.96s)]
*  times made up personal ailments physical ailments so that he himself would not put his own life at [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=592.96s)]
*  risk while hundreds of thousands of other young men were doing exactly that we all know he's [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=598.8s)]
*  actually never been in a fight himself right but loves to stand up with all his bodyguards around [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=604.48s)]
*  him instigating others to get into a physical altercation that's why he loves these tanks [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=609.84s)]
*  rolling down Pennsylvania Avenue on his birthday because he's so insecure it's always the insecure [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=616.32s)]
*  guy who talks like that but you know we are not seeing the country come together in a moment of [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=622.72s)]
*  strength we're seeing it divided because he is pushing those very divisions for his own ego [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=628.8s)]
*  and the other thing that just gets to me and has gotten to me frankly since I was in college [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=636.4799999999999s)]
*  covering protests against the Vietnam War is they don't love our country right that is no no no no [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=643.3599999999999s)]

*  doing at the moment and and the idea that if you protest against him you don't love the country is [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=666.0s)]
*  well it's it's out of some dystopian authoritarian society it's not out of the United States [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS_qkTDx9xo&t=674.24s)]
