# ‘We know you didn’t vote for this’: Rep. Angie Craig on Trump’s economy
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk)
*  We have Minnesota Democratic Representative Angie Craig. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome back to the broadcast, ma'am. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=3.04s)]
*  Good to have you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=4.48s)]
*  Give me your reaction to these new polls [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=5.68s)]
*  and how you think Democrats can capitalize in this, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=7.84s)]
*  especially looking at the economy [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=10.68s)]
*  when you have 60% disapproval on inflation [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=12.96s)]
*  and cost of living, 61% disapproval on tariffs. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=15.84s)]
*  I mean, this was supposedly what got Donald Trump elected. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=19.88s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right, Alex. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=25.28s)]
*  It's great to be back with you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=26.68s)]
*  Voters who voted for Donald Trump, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=28.2s)]
*  those swing voters that allowed him [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=30.12s)]
*  to become the 47th president, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=32.68s)]
*  they voted for him because he promised to lower cost. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=34.5s)]
*  He promised to bring down inflation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  And in fact, in his early days, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=40.08s)]
*  we've seen actions across the board tariffs [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=42.4s)]
*  that are driving up costs in our country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  And it's not surprising to me, Alex, at all [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  that young people are particularly focused [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=50.56s)]
*  on the economy right now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=53.84s)]
*  For folks in that 17 to 29 year old category, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=55.68s)]
*  and all of us, housing, healthcare, and childcare [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=59.04s)]
*  are three of the largest expenses [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=63.72s)]
*  that hit someone's paycheck. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=65.62s)]
*  So if the economy is moving in the wrong direction, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=67.12s)]
*  I think that we need to make sure that people know, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=72.0s)]
*  we know you didn't vote for this [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=74.68s)]
*  and Democrats are gonna make sure [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=76.84s)]
*  that we're fighting for working folks in this country. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=78.34s)]
*  Let's look ahead to the midterms [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=82.9s)]
*  because after DNC vice chair, David Hogg, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=84.54s)]
*  announced that he plans to support challenges [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=87.66000000000001s)]
*  to some Democratic incumbents, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=89.78s)]
*  those in safely Democratic districts, mind you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=91.76s)]
*  Chair Ken Martin openly rebuked him [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=94.54s)]
*  saying DNC officers should be neutral in primary. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  So who's got the right idea? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  Should your colleagues be challenged [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=101.48s)]
*  if they're not effectively fighting for their constituents? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=103.82000000000001s)]
*  Well, that's up to their constituents to decide. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=108.14000000000001s)]
*  I actually represent Ken Martin. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=111.10000000000001s)]
*  He lives in my congressional district right here in Minnesota [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=113.17999999999999s)]
*  and I certainly appreciate David Hogg [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=116.52s)]
*  and all of the activism on gun safety [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=119.3s)]
*  that he's provided around our country. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=122.72s)]
*  But it's really up to Democratic voters who to put forward. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=124.44s)]
*  And right now I think it is a mistake for Democrats [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=128.28s)]
*  to be fighting Democrats. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  Alex, I was across the state of Minnesota this week. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=134.48s)]
*  I put a thousand miles on the car [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=136.84s)]
*  because I decided since my Republican colleagues [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=138.56s)]
*  won't hold town halls in their district. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=141.82s)]
*  After I held one in my own district, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=145.34s)]
*  which had over a thousand people sign up to attend, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  I went around the state and at the end of the day, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=150.5s)]
*  people are very concerned about the economy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=153.62s)]
*  They're concerned about our democracy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=156.54s)]
*  They're concerned that this Republican party [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=158.82s)]
*  and the unelected billionaire, Elon Musk, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=162.18s)]
*  is running roughshod over our party system, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=165.01999999999998s)]
*  our checks and balances in our country. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=169.1s)]
*  And so I wanted to make sure I got out there [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=172.5s)]
*  and I listened to voters. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=174.57999999999998s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=176.02s)]
*  Can I get your reaction to the sit-in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  that Senator Cory Booker and Congressman Hakeem Jeffries [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  are holding right now, in fact, on the Capitol steps? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=182.34s)]
*  I mean, from what you're hearing, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=184.94s)]
*  is this the kind of action that voters are looking for? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=186.3s)]
*  And again, you mentioned the town halls this week. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=188.62s)]
*  They were in Minnesota's four [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=191.14s)]
*  Republican congressional districts. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=192.18s)]
*  I'm curious if you think this is what constituents [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=194.3s)]
*  want to hear and see in terms of action. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=196.5s)]
*  Well, I think constituents want to see action [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=200.06s)]
*  and all of these activities, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  whether it's folks in my communities [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=203.62s)]
*  who are standing on overpasses with signs, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=205.54s)]
*  peacefully protesting, just raising the issues of, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=208.34s)]
*  they're coming after our Medicaid. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=212.62s)]
*  I'm headed back to DC this week. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=213.94s)]
*  Reconciliation process is gonna begin, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=216.38s)]
*  the budget process, and they've asked us [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=218.58s)]
*  to cut $880 billion from Medicaid. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=220.98000000000002s)]
*  I think any action that raises the issues [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  and helps the American people understand [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=229.02s)]
*  why these issues matter to them, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=231.38000000000002s)]
*  cutting Medicaid is going to wipe out [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  rural hospitals across our country. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=236.74s)]
*  And so I applaud Cory Booker. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=238.86s)]
*  I applaud the leader. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=240.5s)]
*  If I was in Washington right now, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=242.18s)]
*  I'd be happy to join them to talk about the policies [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=243.9s)]
*  that the administration and that the Republican Congress, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=247.34s)]
*  who by the way, in private will tell you, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=250.58s)]
*  is bad for their constituents, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=254.06s)]
*  but in public will not stand up and speak out. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=255.86s)]
*  And to me, that's a disgrace. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j0P1wZMQdk&t=258.98s)]
