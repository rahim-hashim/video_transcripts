# 'Trending in the wrong direction': Trump's support slipping on economy, immigration
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0)
*  Joining us now, New York Times White House correspondent Tyler Pager and former Republican Governor John Kasich of Ohio. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=0.0s)]
*  He is also an MSNBC political analyst. So Tyler, how are the numbers being received at the White House? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=5.44s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think the White House is pretty focused on their own narrative this week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=12.36s)]
*  We saw this morning Tom Hommons join Caroline Levitt at the podium for the press briefing as you walk into the White House. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=17.52s)]
*  This morning there are signs of various individuals who have been apprehended. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=24.88s)]
*  So the White House is very focused on driving its own message. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=29.400000000000002s)]
*  We know that Donald Trump pays close attention to polling, but often dismisses polling that he doesn't agree with. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=32.6s)]
*  But I think one of the things to really watch here is less about the White House's response to the polling, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=39.24s)]
*  but more about the broader Republican Party. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=44.44s)]
*  Obviously it's eons before the midterm elections and a lot can change. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=47.160000000000004s)]
*  But as we start to see Trump's numbers slide, particularly as it relates to his handling over the economy, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=51.160000000000004s)]
*  one of the things I'm watching for as Congress returns to session this week is how Republicans, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  particularly some vulnerable Republicans, respond to the president and the clear evidence that there are Americans [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=61.08s)]
*  who are disapproving of his handling of the economy and more broadly. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=69.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, John, immigration and the economy were such an important part of Trump's, you know, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=74.36s)]
*  real action campaign if these polls do become a trend. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=80.84s)]
*  How concerning is that for the White House? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=84.2s)]
*  Well, I would just disagree with Tyler on one point, and that is the midterms are not eons away. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=87.48s)]
*  They're just right around the corner. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  There's a couple things here that are really important. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=96.84s)]
*  One is, of course, I've always said, Jose, you know, on your show that all that matters is the economy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  That's part of it. That's a big thing. He's underwater on that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=105.48s)]
*  I think he's also trending the wrong way because there's a perception that there's some there's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=109.16s)]
*  kind of meanness involved here that, you know, these deportations underline, you know, the story [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  over the weekend. I don't know the whole facts of two years olds and four year olds leaving the country. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=119.96s)]
*  I know that has to do with the parents or whatever, but there's an element. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=125.16s)]
*  Nobody's getting due process. You see Hispanics beginning to turn on him in a significant way. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  But there's two other things that really matter. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=134.92s)]
*  Women under the age of 30 are against him now, two to one. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=137.32s)]
*  And secondly, the country's viewed as still trending in the wrong direction. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=142.2s)]
*  All those things are very serious. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  And so the only thing I say about the Democrats is can they win in the midterms? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=149.39999999999998s)]
*  Can they win the House in the midterms without an agenda? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=154.6s)]
*  I'm not I'm I'm sure they could. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  But if you don't have an agenda that's in touch with where the public is, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=161.72s)]
*  you got a chance you won't win it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=165.88s)]
*  Everybody thought they were going to win it the last time and they didn't. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=167.32s)]
*  So they're going to have to have something positive to say other than all their criticism [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=170.04s)]
*  and attacks, some of them personal on Trump. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=175.72s)]
*  So no, it's it's trending in the wrong direction for him. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=179.32s)]
*  I think he thinks it's going in the right way. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=182.68s)]
*  The tariff issue is a big one. It affects the economy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=184.92s)]
*  But my warning to the Democrats, you want to win the House? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=187.48s)]
*  Tell people what you're going to do for them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=191.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, Republican Congressman Mike Lawler faced some angry folks [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=192.68s)]
*  on Sunday to town hall. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=199.64s)]
*  Here's how one question about the budget cuts played out. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=201.0s)]
*  Take a listen to this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=203.64s)]
*  Both parties over the last 20 years, over the last 20 years, had both parties. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=206.76s)]
*  And sir, ma'am, I'm giving you the context so that you actually understand the process. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  OK, so this, as as John, you're saying, I mean, midterms are literally right around the corner. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=222.68s)]
*  Is this something you think is going to be on the increase? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  Is this kind of pressure that Republicans may be seeing more of? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  Jose, if you're directing that towards me, I know that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=240.84s)]
*  the Republicans now say that life in Washington is crazy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=244.44s)]
*  I saw a couple of them recently and they're like, what do you think it's like down there? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=249.48s)]
*  But what I said to them is I think you're going to get more space. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=254.84s)]
*  I mean, I think there'll be more space for you to do the things that you want to do [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=258.52s)]
*  to gain a little bit of independence from the administration. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=263.32s)]
*  I don't know whether that's going to happen or not. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=269.0s)]
*  I mean, these town halls and everything, that's a lot of the Democrat base coming out and yelling, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=271.24s)]
*  not totally, but mostly. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=275.32000000000005s)]
*  But again, it's like yelling and screaming. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=277.48s)]
*  And so what is it you want to do? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=280.6s)]
*  What is it you want to do to keep our children from being overrun by debt? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=282.92s)]
*  What are you going to do to make sure that the prices of things are going to come down? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=287.8s)]
*  What are you going to do for middle class folks? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  What are you going to do for the young? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  I know Bernie and AOC are out there, but it's like a litany of complaints, but without an agenda. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=296.12s)]
*  Jose, I mean, I can tell you that if you were going to run for office, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=303.0s)]
*  you'd tell people what you were going to do. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=308.20000000000005s)]
*  You just weren't going to spend your time attacking the other people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=309.88s)]
*  But at the same time, Trump's numbers have plummeted [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=312.44s)]
*  and he can try to ignore them, but they're reality. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=316.92s)]
*  Things have moved away from him. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=320.12s)]
*  And so Tyler, how do you think the White House sees these 100 days? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=321.88s)]
*  And you know, there is what you have to say in the messaging, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=326.04s)]
*  but how do they feel these 100 days have been for them? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=328.84s)]
*  I mean, I think it depends who you ask, right? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=333.48s)]
*  If you ask Donald Trump and you ask Stephen Miller, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=335.0s)]
*  this has been an unabashed success. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=338.2s)]
*  And we saw this around the revelation that the Trump team added Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=340.44s)]
*  to the signal chain. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=346.92s)]
*  Trump said we've had a perfect two months. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=348.36s)]
*  And I think as we've seen him do these interviews with Time and with the Atlantic, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=350.2s)]
*  he has been very much believing that his administration has had resounding success. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=354.36s)]
*  I think there are definitely people, allies of the president, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=360.03999999999996s)]
*  people within the administration who are concerned, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=363.4s)]
*  particularly as it relates to the tariffs. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=367.0s)]
*  I think as Governor Kasich just said, the economy is often the major issue for voters. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=369.24s)]
*  And this is clearly weighing down the economy and impacting voters' approval of the president. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=375.16s)]
*  And that is of concern to Republicans, not just here in Washington, but around the country. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=380.92s)]
*  Tyler Page, your former governor, John Kasich, thank you both so very much. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=385.40000000000003s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=388.44000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZWRQfZuqy0&t=405.16s)]
