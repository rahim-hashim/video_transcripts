# Why Musk scaling back his work at DOGE is a ‘perfect storm’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc)
*  Now, as Elon Musk appears to be easing out of his controversial time at the Department [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=0.0s)]
*  of Government efficiency, the wind down comes amid high-profile disagreements, even a reported [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=5.44s)]
*  shouting match with Treasury Secretary Scott Besant, all while Doge claims that it made [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  $160 billion in cuts, far below the $2 trillion goal Musk promised. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=15.6s)]
*  We should note Doge has not released enough details on those cuts for NBC News to confirm [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=21.0s)]
*  that number. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=25.0s)]
*  And after Tesla's profits plunged 71 percent, we'll join me now, we have Washington Post [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=26.18s)]
*  technology reporter Fez Siddiqui. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=31.14s)]
*  Fez, welcome. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=33.46s)]
*  You're the author of the new book, hubris maximus, the shattering of Elon Musk, which [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=34.46s)]
*  makes you the perfect person to talk to. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=38.34s)]
*  Look, Fez, Musk says that he is scaling back his work with Doge in May and is going to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=40.26s)]
*  return to Tesla. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=44.3s)]
*  His departure is a bit earlier than the six months afforded to his special government [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=45.66s)]
*  employee status. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=49.06s)]
*  Is he leaving early because of friction with White House officials and cabinet members [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=50.64s)]
*  or because Tesla has significantly dropped in value since he got to Washington? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=54.339999999999996s)]
*  Hey, thanks for having me. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=60.14s)]
*  So it's a perfect storm for Musk. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=61.22s)]
*  Obviously, those first few months with Doge have been controversial, to say the least. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=63.3s)]
*  Tesla has faced a tremendous amount of blowback with these protests and vandalism even and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=68.14s)]
*  obviously the brand damage to the company. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=75.7s)]
*  So Musk now has what looks like an out in that, you know, his terms of special government [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=79.22s)]
*  employees expected to last 130 working days. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=85.5s)]
*  He says Doge essentially working around the clock. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=88.78s)]
*  One hundred thirty working days would put that at the end of May, which we're coming [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=90.86000000000001s)]
*  right up on now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=94.62s)]
*  There's a new CNBC survey which shows about half of Americans have a negative view on [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=96.86000000000001s)]
*  Tesla and Elon Musk. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=101.10000000000001s)]
*  Some suggest the damage has been permanent to the brand. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=102.66000000000001s)]
*  From what you know about Musk, how much do low polls bother him? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=106.33999999999999s)]
*  Because when you see that video of him with that chainsaw at CPAC in February, he seemed [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=109.78s)]
*  to relish his role with the Trump administration. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=114.41999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is somebody who has a very high tolerance for risk, who has been willing to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=117.94s)]
*  do what's necessary in his view, you know, to make his company successful, even if that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=123.78s)]
*  meant being on the brink of collapse. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=130.18s)]
*  So you have to now apply that to electoral politics. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=133.98s)]
*  Musk is very, you know, risk tolerant. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  So this is a new situation for him where he might be facing heat because of the polling. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=141.22s)]
*  And you get really direct, tangible impacts from some of his unpopularity, say, if you [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=146.74s)]
*  trot him out on the campaign trail. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=151.7s)]
*  But, you know, this is, as you said, something that he has been shown to be tolerant to or [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=154.74s)]
*  able to handle. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=161.74s)]
*  So what's interesting in your new book, you say that the way Elon Musk has handled his [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=163.70000000000002s)]
*  brief time in politics is consistent with the way he runs his business. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  So the best way to understand what he's going to do next is to see what he's previously [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=170.82s)]
*  done. What are some examples of this and what can we expect from Elon Musk next? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=175.34s)]
*  What do you think the chances are he's done with politics? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=180.3s)]
*  So shortly after establishing himself within government, you know, federal workers then [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=183.02s)]
*  receive an email titled A Fork in the Road that basically asked them to commit to similar to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=189.82s)]
*  something you said at Twitter, a hardcore workflow essentially, or resign. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=196.26s)]
*  The Twitter email had exactly that subject line, very similar language. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=201.82s)]
*  And then within Twitter, you know, they were scouring the logs for evidence of this [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=205.98s)]
*  conspiracy that they believed was happening behind the scenes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=211.54s)]
*  Within government, you know, Doge deputies are scouring the logs and they do not want the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=214.1s)]
*  input of the existing bureaucrats, similar to how they didn't want the input of the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=219.14s)]
*  existing Twitter staff under Musk's management. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=223.01999999999998s)]
*  You wrote an article this week, Fez, explaining Musk's quirky personality and freewheeling [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=226.66s)]
*  style were once attractive to the Republican Party, but now he's seen as a lightning rod. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=231.26s)]
*  When and why did some Republicans turn on him? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=235.94s)]
*  And do you include MAGA members in that group? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=237.94s)]
*  So there seems to be less of a, you know, runway in politics for this style that Musk [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=241.61999999999998s)]
*  has, which, as I said, can drive a company to the brink. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=248.7s)]
*  But if you are a political campaign, you need to be taking constant polling, you need to be taking [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=252.38s)]
*  the temperature on how your messaging is being received. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=257.21999999999997s)]
*  And this is not, you know, what Elon is used to as far as running a company. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=261.38s)]
*  Are MAGA members put off by this? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=266.82s)]
*  Well, it certainly seems like those in the administration, especially those who have had [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=269.38s)]
*  spats with Musk, allies of those folks are feeling the pressure from some of what he's doing [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=274.18s)]
*  and a little bit miffed, to say the least, at various different points with Elon. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6PNpUvpNc&t=280.21999999999997s)]
