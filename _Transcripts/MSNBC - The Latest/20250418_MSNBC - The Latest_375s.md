# Busted: Report paints vivid picture of Trump corruption
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4)
*  It's just a little throwaway line and a much bigger story, but sometimes those little throwaway [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=0.0s)]
*  lines are very helpful, and they really stick with me. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=5.28s)]
*  I'll show you what I mean. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=8.56s)]
*  Here's the headline in The Wall Street Journal. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=10.72s)]
*  The headline is, Anxious Trading Partners Promise to Buy American to Stave Off Trump's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=12.08s)]
*  Tariffs. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=16.96s)]
*  You've seen a million articles like this, right? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=17.96s)]
*  The bulk of the article under that headline is about what you would expect. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=19.42s)]
*  Again, you've seen a lot like this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=22.36s)]
*  It's about various countries trying to strike deals with the U.S. so they can get themselves [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=23.76s)]
*  some relief, some favored treatment from Trump amid his gigantic, catastrophic world tariff [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=28.92s)]
*  experiment. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=36.56s)]
*  So the countries are trying to get themselves some kind of relief, and among those discussed [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=38.24s)]
*  in this article is the nation of Vietnam. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=43.58s)]
*  According to The Wall Street Journal, Vietnam has been trying to fend off harsh treatment [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=47.92s)]
*  under Trump's tariffs by, number one, buying American jets, number two, allowing the Starlink [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=53.68s)]
*  Internet service that's owned by Donald Trump's top campaign donor, Elon Musk, to operate [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=61.56s)]
*  inside their country. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=66.68s)]
*  Weird that they decided that was a good idea. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  And number three, here's the kicker, Vietnam has also, quote, decided to accelerate the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=70.72s)]
*  $1.5 billion Trump resorts in Vietnam. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=78.98s)]
*  Oh, weird how that might get you better treatment from the U.S. government. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=82.98s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure Vietnam has lots of good reasons to make sure a Trump Organization [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=88.82000000000001s)]
*  resort project is moving forward, lots and lots and lots of them. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=93.22s)]
*  It's weird that they think that might be correlated with the U.S. government giving [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=97.54s)]
*  them some sort of favorable treatment. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=101.9s)]
*  But let's just stick a pin in that one for a second. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=103.94s)]
*  There's another story I want to tell you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=107.14s)]
*  And I will tell you, even though I'm going to use the word cryptocurrency in telling [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=109.26s)]
*  you this story, don't worry. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=114.86s)]
*  You don't have to understand anything about cryptocurrency in order to get this story. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=116.06s)]
*  But here it is. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=120.66s)]
*  A couple of years ago, the Justice Department accused an online cryptocurrency company that's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=121.66s)]
*  called Binance of being basically a supermarket for crime. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=125.86s)]
*  DOJ accused Binance of being a giant money laundering hub for terrorists and cyber criminals [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=130.78s)]
*  and customers in sanctioned countries like Iran and Russia. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=139.06s)]
*  Binance pled guilty. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=144.5s)]
*  They paid over $4 billion. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  That was the largest fine ever in the history of crypto. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=147.45999999999998s)]
*  Its founder spent four months in prison. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=151.17999999999998s)]
*  Ever since, Binance has been overseen by U.S. government appointed monitors who ensure that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  Binance is no longer a supermarket for crime. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=158.86s)]
*  It is now following the law and making sure Binance is only operating overseas and not [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=162.5s)]
*  operating in the United States at all. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=168.46s)]
*  Now, Binance, naturally, they would very much like to get out from under that oversight. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=171.02s)]
*  And they would very much like to operate in the United States again. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=174.94000000000003s)]
*  But to do that, they need to get these pesky government monitors off their back. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=177.58s)]
*  They need the U.S. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=181.22000000000003s)]
*  government to decide they are out of the doghouse. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=182.22000000000003s)]
*  And it would make their return easier, of course, if their founder were no longer a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=185.58s)]
*  convicted felon. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=190.5s)]
*  Well, when Donald Trump won the election last year, Binance sensed opportunity. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=192.34s)]
*  This is also from The Wall Street Journal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=198.02s)]
*  Quote, at an Abu Dhabi crypto conference last December, weeks before the inauguration, in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=200.86s)]
*  the Wales-only back room accessible to attendees who had paid $10,000 for a VIP pass, Binance's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=206.18s)]
*  founder mingled with Trump's sons, Trump's son, Eric, and Trump allies. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=214.34s)]
*  Eric was there to promote World Liberty, a crypto venture the Trump family had founded [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=220.82s)]
*  months earlier. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=225.26s)]
*  For World Liberty, Binance's market power could help turn it into a serious player in [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=226.5s)]
*  the crypto industry. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=231.06s)]
*  Binance has more than 250 million users. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=232.3s)]
*  The more World Liberty cryptocurrency in circulation, of course, quote, the more the Trump family [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=236.9s)]
*  could profit. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=241.9s)]
*  Again, ignore the word, like, cryptocurrency. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=243.70000000000002s)]
*  This could be anything. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=247.94s)]
*  I mean, say the Trump family had launched a new company that makes doohickeys. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=248.94s)]
*  Well, Binance, if they partnered with the Trump family in this enterprise, they could [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=252.74s)]
*  get Trump doohickeys in front of hundreds of millions of potential customers, which [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=257.26s)]
*  would, of course, mean lots of profit for the Trump family. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=261.3s)]
*  That is what Binance is offering to the Trump family. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=264.86s)]
*  What does Binance want? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, their convicted felon founder, quote, has been pushing for a Trump administration [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=270.82s)]
*  pardon, has been pushing for the Trump administration to grant him a pardon. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=276.41999999999996s)]
*  And the Wall Street Journal reports, quote, executives from Binance met with Treasury [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=280.82s)]
*  Department officials last month and discussed loosening U.S. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=284.34s)]
*  government oversight on the company. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=287.53999999999996s)]
*  Quote, Binance executives are optimistic the Trump administration will acquiesce. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=289.05999999999995s)]
*  Oh, they are, are they? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=294.17999999999995s)]
*  Maybe that's because as president, Donald Trump has already pardoned a whole slew of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=295.73999999999995s)]
*  crypto felons and his Justice Department has just disbanded its crypto policing unit. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=299.9s)]
*  And also because Trump's SEC halted an investigation of another crypto executive after [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=305.34s)]
*  that executive dumped seventy five million dollars into the Trump family crypto company. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=310.62s)]
*  So if the Wall Street Journal's reporting on this bears out, this is not even like this, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=318.14s)]
*  this isn't even like textbook corruption because you would not need to get to the level [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=323.09999999999997s)]
*  of school that uses textbooks in order to get to this level of understanding of corruption. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=328.42s)]
*  This is like a coloring book of corruption. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=334.82s)]
*  This is like corruption that you could understand if you'd never been to any school ever anywhere. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=337.14000000000004s)]
*  In any other time in American history, this scandal, one tenth of this scandal would be [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=343.38s)]
*  the end of a presidency. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=348.66s)]
*  But this is just like day that ends in Y. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=351.62s)]
*  This is our life now. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eABg1ORl4&t=353.62s)]
