# U.S., China agree on framework to de-escalate trade tensions
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo)
*  You know what time it is, money power politics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=0.0s)]
*  We are following major news tonight [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  that the United States and China have agreed [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=5.2s)]
*  to a framework to deescalate trade tensions. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=7.84s)]
*  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutner confirmed this news [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=11.52s)]
*  saying rare earth experts are quote, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=14.4s)]
*  a fundamental part of that framework. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=17.0s)]
*  So let's discuss. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=19.8s)]
*  I wanna bring in my friend Bill Cohen, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=20.68s)]
*  founding partner of Puck News [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=22.12s)]
*  and a former Wall Street banker and Justin Wolfers, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=23.76s)]
*  a professor of economics and public policy [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=26.16s)]
*  at University of Michigan, Professor Wolfers. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=28.88s)]
*  Until now, it did not seem like the US and China [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  were making much progress or any progress at all. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=36.16s)]
*  How should we view this? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=39.32s)]
*  Howard Lutnik is telling us deescalation is underway. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=40.4s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=44.74s)]
*  Well, the question is what's actually different today [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=46.68s)]
*  than yesterday and Howard Lutnik has not told me [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=49.72s)]
*  a single thing that's different today than yesterday. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=52.08s)]
*  The whole thing, I mean, there's lots of verbiage. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  It's wonderful, it's fruitful, we're doing amazing things. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=59.8s)]
*  The whole thing is at the end of the day, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=63.31999999999999s)]
*  they may have agreed that they're agreeing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  that the old agreement is still their agreement. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=68.8s)]
*  Now they're not actually agreeing on that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=70.89999999999999s)]
*  It's on the handshake agreement. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=72.36s)]
*  And they said before they agree on the old agreement [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=74.36s)]
*  that they have to go back and get the sign off [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=77.4s)]
*  from Trump and Xi. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=79.28s)]
*  So at the end of this, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  they've negotiated a handshake agreement [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=81.4s)]
*  to seek sign off to agree that a previously agreed agreement [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=84.16s)]
*  was still their agreed upon agreement. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=87.28s)]
*  Now that previous agreement, just to be clear, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=89.8s)]
*  was not in fact an agreement, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  but was a framework for making future agreements. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=93.08s)]
*  Got it? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=97.56s)]
*  Bill, do you agree? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, Justin said it beautifully, I thought Stephanie. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=101.4s)]
*  But what do I do with the framework, Stephanie? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=105.12s)]
*  I mean, this is a president and an administration [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=107.69999999999999s)]
*  that loves chaos, thrives on chaos for whatever reason, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=111.0s)]
*  to cover up all sorts of other things that it's doing [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=115.64s)]
*  that doesn't want us to know about, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=118.8s)]
*  whether it's the riots in LA that creates chaos. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=121.52s)]
*  I think this Liberation Day has created [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=125.16s)]
*  an unbelievable amount of chaos in financial markets. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=128.72s)]
*  And just in decision making in corporate boardrooms, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=132.72s)]
*  in CEO suites, how, if you're Tim Cook, Stephanie, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=136.36s)]
*  and you're thinking about moving production to India, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  do you now reverse course and keep it in China [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  because we've got a framework for what might work [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  and how long does it take? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=148.92s)]
*  And the tariffs gonna be 145%, they're gonna be 30%. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  What are they gonna be? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=154.32s)]
*  Am I gonna be able to get my rare earth metals [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  that I need to make my phones? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  Am I gonna be able to use workers in China [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=159.56s)]
*  to make my phones? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=162.12s)]
*  Or do I have to move to India? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=163.2s)]
*  How do you make that decision with a framework? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=164.4s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you, you don't. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=168.16s)]
*  We also know that an appeals court [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=171.4s)]
*  has allowed Donald Trump's tariffs to remain in effect [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=174.52s)]
*  for at least the next two months [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  until all oral arguments begin in late July. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  What do you think about that, Justin? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=183.08s)]
*  Because that only furthers Bill's argument [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=184.52s)]
*  that if you're a big business, a small business, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=187.96s)]
*  or you're an investor, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=189.84s)]
*  you're still sitting on a bed of nails here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=191.12s)]
*  Yeah, so the history here is really important. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=194.8s)]
*  Let's go back way back in history. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=197.84s)]
*  The Constitution says the power over tariffs [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=199.44s)]
*  belongs to Congress, that's history. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=203.04s)]
*  The reciprocal tariffs, which are not reciprocal, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=206.48s)]
*  were authorized under the Emergency Powers Act, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=211.24s)]
*  an act that does not include the word tariff, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=215.0s)]
*  plus we're not in an emergency. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  So the International Trade Court says, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=220.8s)]
*  this doesn't seem right, so they suspended them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=222.28s)]
*  So then the court said, oh, we'll hear it, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=225.72s)]
*  the appeals court, but we'll give it till June 9th. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=228.48s)]
*  I need everyone to get their arguments in, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=232.76s)]
*  till then we'll stay proceedings. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=234.24s)]
*  So then they decide, all right, today's June 10th, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=237.16s)]
*  they've had a look at everything, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=239.2s)]
*  they're like, oh yeah, good idea, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=240.04s)]
*  we'll definitely take oral arguments now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=241.48s)]
*  Those start July 31st, and so we're gonna get [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=243.72s)]
*  two or three months of quite plausibly [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=246.76s)]
*  unconstitutional tariffs. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=249.08s)]
*  The administration's upset [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=251.88s)]
*  because they think it undermines their leverage. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=253.16s)]
*  Of course it does, using unconstitutional powers [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  when you still have a constitution [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=257.84s)]
*  is actually not something you're meant to do. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=259.52s)]
*  And businesses are upset because what happens [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=262.2s)]
*  after all of this goes through, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=264.2s)]
*  and so we're gonna have pointless destructive tariffs [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=265.64s)]
*  that will probably unconstitutional all along, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=268.76s)]
*  but the legal system is not meant for dealing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  with a White House that has so little respect [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  for the Constitution. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=276.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbMleHgIKo&t=284.76s)]
