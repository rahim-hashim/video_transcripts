# Ernst posts weird non-apology on Instagram after telling town hall 'we all are going to die'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds)
*  I was also proud to vote for President Trump's one big beautiful bill, a generational investment to secure our borders. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=0.0s)]
*  When you are arguing, when you are arguing about illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=7.2s)]
*  1.4 million, 1.4 million, they're not, they are not eligible, so they will be coming off. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=14.88s)]
*  So we people are not, well we all are going to die. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=23.68s)]
*  There you have it folks, Republicans complete indifference on display at town halls this week [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  to their constituents very real concerns about the massive cuts expected from Trump's budget bill. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=40.64s)]
*  The bill still has to limp its way through the Senate, but as it stands right now it calls for [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  700 billion dollars in Medicaid cuts and could cancel health insurance for 8.6 million Americans. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=51.12s)]
*  Paola Ramos and V. Spear are back with us. Before we get your thoughts on this, I do just want to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  update this very important story with what is being described as an apology by Senator [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=64.08s)]
*  Joan Ernst. Take a listen to what she said in response. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=69.92s)]
*  I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that yes, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=72.32s)]
*  we are all going to perish from this earth. So I apologize and I'm really, really glad that I did [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well. Okay, so that was her being [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=95.92s)]
*  sarcastic and totally missing the point of what the real grievance was. It's not that people don't [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  know that they're going to die on this earth, it is that people want to live and have access [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=107.76s)]
*  to health care and when you deny them access to health care, you are accelerating their chances [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  of death and nobody wants their death to be accelerated. You just know she got off that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=122.0s)]
*  self tape and was like, nailed it. She's like, guys, I got him. Yeah, she got him. She got him. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=127.76s)]
*  Eight. Yeah. No, what a weird thing to do, huh? To double down on. I thought at first, oh, maybe [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=135.04s)]
*  she's kind of going for it and then no, of course not. No. I feel like there's a lot of them, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=141.2s)]
*  lawmakers, I mean, who think they have like the sauce that Trump has, like to off a cuff, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  be nasty in a funny way and it's actually an incredibly rare skill, like I hate to use that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=153.44s)]
*  word, but that was just really bizarre to watch. There was nothing fun. I can't even imagine [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=159.44s)]
*  one of her supporters or colleagues, collaborators, watching that and being like, hey, guys, don't [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  worry, I got this one. Don't worry, I know how to get us out of this mess. Watch this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=170.4s)]
*  Not to be the earnest one on this panel, but like there is actually evidence that when people [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  lose their Medicaid, they have a much higher risk of death. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  saying. Get off Medicaid. You are. There's a new study. We've got the stats. Yeah, there was a new [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=185.28s)]
*  study that came out, I think this week or last week from a couple of economists, one in Dartmouth, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  one of the University of Chicago. Actually, the Chicago guy is known generally reputed to be [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=194.24s)]
*  relatively conservative that basically finds that when people lose their Medicaid, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=198.16s)]
*  they are something like 21% at higher risk of mortality and that a huge reason why [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=203.28s)]
*  rich people live longer than poor people is access to health insurance. So I just don't [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=210.96s)]
*  understand. She knows that. She knows that. She knows that. Or not though, because that's the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  thing. They don't understand this life and death reality. I think this is where it is becoming [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=223.68s)]
*  increasingly harder to sell Trump's agenda because people are realizing that this populism that he [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=231.52s)]
*  sold is totally fake. He's the fakest populist out there. He ran. He promised that he was an [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=238.08s)]
*  anti-establishment, anti-elite. He's one of us. And here you're seeing how finally, even Republicans [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  are starting to understand how out of touch they all are. And then you start to see the way that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=249.84s)]
*  it is exposing this contradiction that we're all aware of, which is that Trump supporters [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=255.6s)]
*  rely on the Social Security safety net. In fact, almost more than anyone. Going back to Miami, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=260.32s)]
*  Miami-Dade County has a huge amount of Cuban-American Trump supporters. Miami-Dade [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=266.32s)]
*  County also happens to be the county that has the highest rate of Obamacare enrollees in the nation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=271.2s)]
*  This is kind of the contradiction that is now being exposed, and this is where Democrats can perhaps [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=277.44s)]
*  run and win with that message. Republicans have been a little bit smart about the Medicaid cuts [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  initially. They wanted to have them start, I think, in 2028. Now they're going to start [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=288.8s)]
*  after the midterms. The question is, people who are not as tuned into daily machinations in the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  legislature and things like that, will they actually notice before it is too late? I don't [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  We had to change how we talked about it. Because when I say, oh, we're cutting Medicaid, they're [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  like, well, I'm not on Medicaid. I'm on BadgerCare. I'm on TennCare. I'm on a different thing. So it [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=311.44s)]
*  was about getting with local folks and making sure that people know this will affect you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=316.08s)]
*  And then Republican politicians lying and saying, well, we're just kicking off all the immigrants [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=320.16s)]
*  that shouldn't be on it in the first place. All the freeloaders. All the freeloaders. All the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=323.92s)]
*  video games in their basements. Able-bodied men who don't work and are on Medicaid out there, like, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=326.16s)]
*  who are they? And so when you can tell that truth and get people into these town halls who are like, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=330.88s)]
*  I am the person that you're looking down on, that's really, I think, changing. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  Let me play for you guys, Congressman Mike Flood from Nebraska, because he was asked [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=340.88s)]
*  specifically about this. Watch his response to your point. Watch this. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=344.72s)]
*  Can you please tell us why you voted to approve a budget bill that includes section 70302, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=349.6s)]
*  which effectively prohibits federal courts from enforcing contempt orders? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=356.0s)]
*  You got me out of my question. Now we've got 30 seconds. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=360.08s)]
*  Which would then allow current and future administrations to ignore those [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=365.44s)]
*  contempt orders by removing the enforcement capabilities. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=370.16s)]
*  I do not agree with that section that was added to that bill. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=373.92s)]
*  This provision was unknown to me when I voted for the bill. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=378.16s)]
*  Unknown to me. It's different than Medicaid. But the reason why I wanted to bring it up is [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=385.2s)]
*  I wonder to what extent these politicians who are voting for these bills know what's in the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  damn bill when they're voting for it. I think they're kind of high on their own supply, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  right? They believe the talking points, this is only going to affect the freeloaders, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=400.0s)]
*  this is only going to affect undocumented immigrants on Medicaid, who, by the way, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=404.24s)]
*  are not allowed to be on Medicaid already. It's coming in from a GOP comms person [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=408.0s)]
*  at headquarters. He's like, here are the talking points on the bill. Just stick to these talking [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=413.76s)]
*  points. And then you get a congressman at a town hall who's like, I don't know what was in the bill. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=417.28s)]
*  Because if you tell one lie, you have to tell another lie. And this lie is compounding on [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=421.2s)]
*  itself. So the folks who sold the MAGA agenda just a couple months ago, really, they can't give it [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=425.52s)]
*  up right now. They'll look like a liar. So they have to tell another lie to cover that one and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=430.96s)]
*  keep it going and keep it going. But people smell that arrogance. And I think Republicans [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=434.23999999999995s)]
*  are smelling that arrogance, that blind loyalty to Trump and their understanding how dangerous [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  it is. And going back to the Democrats, like this to me is an entry point. Perhaps casting [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=442.23999999999995s)]
*  Trump as this threat to democracy is less palpable, because we're talking about ideology. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=446.88s)]
*  But this is where you see the corruption. This is where you see the conflict of interest. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=451.6s)]
*  Do you see anyone harnessing that effectively right now? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=455.36s)]
*  In the Democratic Party or generally? Because I see boomer women harnessing it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=459.12s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=462.48s)]
*  They're out there, right? They're like, oh, a bunch of them are in the Democratic Party. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=463.2s)]
*  They already marched in the 60s. I am sick of this. My kids are growing. I'm going to these town [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=465.92s)]
*  halls like that lady was. And they're actually reading all 1,000 pages of the bill. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=470.88s)]
*  They are reading it and they're making TikToks about it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6qbajV7ds&t=474.88s)]
