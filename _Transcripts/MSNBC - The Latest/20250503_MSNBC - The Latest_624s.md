# Judge strikes down Trump order targeting law firm
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4)
*  While President Trump has forced the Republican Party into submission, it has been left to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=0.0s)]
*  some of the country's other institutions to push back and not simply accept what has been [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=4.96s)]
*  described as Trump's extreme, vindictive, and sometimes constitutionally questionable [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=9.72s)]
*  policies, even if it means facing a backlash from the administration. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=14.92s)]
*  For the first time last night, a federal judge permanently blocked the Trump administration [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=19.64s)]
*  from enforcing one of its many orders to punish a law firm Trump opposes politically, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=24.78s)]
*  this one targeting the law firm Perkins-Cooey, which represented the 2016 Democratic presidential [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=31.04s)]
*  nominee Hillary Clinton and works with billionaire donor George Soros. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=36.0s)]
*  In a blistering opinion, U.S. District Judge Barrel Howell called Trump's efforts, quote, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=41.32s)]
*  an unprecedented attack on the U.S. judicial system. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=47.18000000000001s)]
*  Howell wrote, and I quote, no American president has ever before issued executive orders like [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=56.18s)]
*  to be executed by all executive branch agencies, but in purpose and effect, this action draws [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=61.06s)]
*  from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase, the first thing we do, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=67.62s)]
*  let's kill all the lawyers. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=73.34s)]
*  Joining us now, conservative attorney George Conway. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=75.62s)]
*  He is president of the Society for the Rule of Law and Sky Perryman, president and CEO [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=78.56s)]
*  of Democracy Forward, an organization that is fighting to protect the rights of migrants. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=83.9s)]
*  Sky, George, thank you very much for being here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=89.0s)]
*  George, Judge Howell is focused on intent here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  She agreed it violated the first and fifth amendments, but does this actually stop the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=97.06s)]
*  administration? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=102.26s)]
*  If she sees that it's a violation, talk about the role of intent here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=103.26s)]
*  Well, the role, I mean, clearly the role is that Trump intends to punish law firms that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  defy him or that he feels that oppose him. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=112.68s)]
*  And I think the danger is, I mean, I think the decision is great. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=116.68s)]
*  I mean, the danger is that law firms may still go into various agencies of the government [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=120.2s)]
*  and they may be denied the things that they might otherwise get, you know, sub-silenio, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=126.76s)]
*  as we say as lawyers, like quietly and under... [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  I was going to say, that is English. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that they may, you know, they may sort of get screwed anyway, but not openly. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=136.92s)]
*  But that said, they got to fight. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=141.72s)]
*  And this is, you know, if that does happen, they're going to have to try to make a case [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=143.39999999999998s)]
*  against that too. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  But I think the important message is to the public and to the bar. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=147.66s)]
*  And in a footnote in Judge Howell's opinion, she basically castigated the law firms that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  have capitulated to Donald Trump by saying, this is not how you're supposed to behave [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  as lawyers and you're not the people who are going to be remembered well. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=162.94s)]
*  And I think that the way that we fight back is to all fight back and to fight back for [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=167.16s)]
*  everyone's rights and not just, you know, say, oh, okay, I'm just going to give in and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=171.68s)]
*  everyone... [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=175.64s)]
*  That courage is contagious just the same way as cowardice is. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  And she's encouraging people to be courageous. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=180.4s)]
*  So Scott, is this just about messaging or is there some actual, you know, thinking and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  practice here? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=189.32s)]
*  I mean, we just saw another headline yesterday that goes in line with law firms, you know, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=190.32s)]
*  deciding not to bend the knee, which is Microsoft dropping the law firm that made a deal with [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=196.44s)]
*  Trump from a case. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=200.76s)]
*  The tech giant instead engaged a firm that is fighting the president's executive orders, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=201.96s)]
*  Jenner and Glock, in a sign that those firms can still attract clients. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=206.12s)]
*  Microsoft declined to comment on why it changed law firms in a significant case last week. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=209.6s)]
*  But the switch suggests that a firm that chose to fight the Trump administration could still [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=214.26s)]
*  attract an important client. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=218.44s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=220.0s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, people expect lawyers, especially big companies, they expect their [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=221.0s)]
*  lawyers to fight for them. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  It's kind of like the whole job. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  It's the whole job. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  The whole job. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  We do it every day. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  And so when you see something like an executive order that came out of the White House, which [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  was the most unconstitutional thing, it would be a law school exam. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=234.44s)]
*  You know, it is classic, right? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that it's unconstitutional. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  I think that these... you see people both quietly and now more publicly saying, you [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=243.23999999999998s)]
*  know, we expect our lawyers to be advocates. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  If the lawyers won't fight for themselves, who are they going to fight for? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  Who are they going to fight for? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  And so I think you see this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  You know, it's a really interesting data point, especially after we see the very strong opinion [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=254.84s)]
*  last night. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=260.08s)]
*  And the other thing in that opinion is she also goes after the administration's attempt [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=261.08s)]
*  to bully law firms into backing away from their commitments to diversity, equity and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=265.44s)]
*  inclusion from expressing their ideas about how the legal profession should look as also [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=270.8s)]
*  just blatantly, you know, just another piece of this blatantly unconstitutional playbook. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=276.36s)]
*  So that's very significant as well. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm most curious about the impact of something like this, right? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=283.24s)]
*  We've been seeing over the last few weeks, I hate the word resistance, but kind of like [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=285.68s)]
*  a resistance rising. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=289.28s)]
*  You know, you talked about these institutions fighting back, courage being contagious. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=290.84s)]
*  Is that... do you guys think that's going to keep going or is this kind of a flash in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  the pan here? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=297.96s)]
*  No, I think it is going to keep going. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=298.96s)]
*  I do. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=300.32s)]
*  I mean, I think we've seen Harvard stand up to the administration. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=301.32s)]
*  We're seeing all these four law firms that have sued and they're all going to win. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=305.88s)]
*  I mean, this is the first of... [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=310.24s)]
*  I mean, they've already won at the temporary restraining order stage. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=311.24s)]
*  This is the first permanent injunctions decision. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=314.76s)]
*  They're going to go four for four. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  And I think what's going to happen is these victories and these law firms standing up [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=319.47999999999996s)]
*  are going to basically discourage people. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=324.84s)]
*  They're going to make the people who are scaredy cats, who are first scared of Trump, they're [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=326.8s)]
*  going to be scared of being pointed out as the people who are a chicken. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=331.2s)]
*  And I think that's especially... [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=336.96s)]
*  Microsoft is reinforcing that by hiring a law firm that fought. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, George, to your point about Harvard, they put out a very strong statement yesterday [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=342.88s)]
*  and part of it says the unlawful use of this instrument taking away their taxes exempt [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=347.23999999999995s)]
*  status more broadly would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  And this gets to a bigger point made in the New York Times editorial on Thursday talking [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=356.96s)]
*  about... the headline is, there is a way forward, how to defeat Trump. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=363.28s)]
*  In the very end it says... [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=366.88s)]
*  The most promising path to stopping Mr. Trump involves making him pay a political price [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=368.92s)]
*  for pursuing his authoritarian dreams. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  The less popular he becomes, the easier it will be for his targets to stand up to him [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=375.21999999999997s)]
*  and the harder it will be for congressional Republicans to remain silent without worrying [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=379.36s)]
*  that they are risking their political futures. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=384.12s)]
*  George, my question is, how long is it going to take congressional Republicans to stop [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  remaining silent? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=392.48s)]
*  You know, I keep losing this battle for years. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=394.2s)]
*  Sooner or later everybody is going to see that the Emperor has no clothes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=397.72s)]
*  I mean, I can't believe it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  It's the morning, George. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=402.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=404.84000000000003s)]
*  You didn't have your coffee. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, sooner or later people are going to realize what have they been afraid of? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the man is a fool, the man is insane. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  It's just like, what is everyone afraid of? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  And the problem is the reason why everyone is afraid is because other people are afraid. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=418.84000000000003s)]
*  And once you realize there's no there there, it's over for him. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=421.88s)]
*  And that's going to happen. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=426.88s)]
*  The problem is it's happened a few years too late. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=427.88s)]
*  And I want to lift up though what ordinary, average, day-to-day Americans are doing in this country [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=429.88s)]
*  because we've been doing this since day one of this administration where we have seen the courage [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=435.88s)]
*  that the big institutions are now taking, they're now stepping up a little bit. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=440.88s)]
*  We've been seeing that in small towns, in urban areas. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=443.88s)]
*  We've been seeing communities get into court. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=447.88s)]
*  These over 200 lawsuits that have been filed against the administration for harmful and unlawful activity, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=449.92s)]
*  they have been filed by real people and real institutions that don't always get the limelight. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=455.92s)]
*  But they've been leading with their courage. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=460.92s)]
*  And courage is the new currency. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=462.92s)]
*  That's what we're saying around our team at Democracy Forward. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=463.92s)]
*  It's the new currency. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=466.92s)]
*  And I think that you are going to see this build. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=467.92s)]
*  And it's been a good week for the courageous, I think. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=469.92s)]
*  George, I want to push back a little bit though on there being no there there. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=472.92s)]
*  I mean, you know, Judge Katanji Brown Jackson said yesterday that all of this was designed to intimidate [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  and attack the judiciary. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  She said the attacks are not random. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=485.96000000000004s)]
*  They're designed to intimidate us. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=487.96000000000004s)]
*  Those of us who serve in this critical capacity, the threats and harassment are attacks on our democracy, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=489.96000000000004s)]
*  on our system of government, and they ultimately risk undermining our constitution and the rule of law. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=493.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, people are there are real fears. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=498.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, there are real fears of political violence, retribution, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=502.0s)]
*  sort of a lone wolf potentially being galvanized by Trump's rhetoric. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=505.0s)]
*  I mean, can you can you acknowledge some of those? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=511.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, absolutely. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=515.0s)]
*  I mean, there is that physical danger. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=516.0s)]
*  And that is, you know, I mean, that is a terrible aspect of this. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=518.0s)]
*  But at the same time, most I mean, those are going to be isolated. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=522.0s)]
*  I don't think they have they are organized enough to really engage in that level of violence that would deter people [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=527.04s)]
*  from standing up if everyone stands up. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=533.04s)]
*  And we that's the point. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=536.04s)]
*  We had thousands, thousands of individual lawyers from the conservative movement and from the more progressive [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=537.04s)]
*  legal movements all joined together a few weeks ago to send a letter to Pam Bondi about stop these attacks on the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=543.04s)]
*  legal profession. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=549.04s)]
*  That takes, you know, a lot of courage in this moment to send something into the Department of Justice. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=550.04s)]
*  Put your name on it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=555.0799999999999s)]
*  Thousands of lawyers across the country in the in forty eight hours got together to do that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  And so I think that you are going to see that, you know, people can despite their fear. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=561.0799999999999s)]
*  And that's the point. It's like we overcome those fears of the, you know, the isolated attack, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  the physical attack by banding together and feeling as part of a group that we are standing together for the rule of [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=571.0799999999999s)]
*  law, for ourselves and against people who are trying to bully us. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=579.0799999999999s)]
*  The bullies win if we let them, but they don't win if they don't. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=583.12s)]
*  This administration has no plan, no second order plan if we fight and if we show courage. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=586.12s)]
*  They've shown they have a plan if you retreat. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=592.12s)]
*  And so that's the that's the role of the next few days. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=594.12s)]
*  And we'll be continuing to look out for the law firms, institutions that do decide to fight back. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=597.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnP3GNd7t4&t=613.08s)]
