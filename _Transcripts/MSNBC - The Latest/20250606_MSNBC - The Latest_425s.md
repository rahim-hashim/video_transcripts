# Veteran knocks Trump for using $50M on birthday parade while DOGE cuts VA funding
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M)
*  Today is June 6th, the anniversary of D-Day, when American troops joined allied forces, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=0.0s)]
*  changing the course of World War II to bring down Hitler's tyranny. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=6.0s)]
*  On today's anniversary, thousands of veterans and families are gathering right now for the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=10.96s)]
*  United for Veterans, Unite for America rally at the National Mall. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=16.04s)]
*  They're demanding protections for veterans' jobs, health care, and essential VA services [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  that are being cut by the Trump administration. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=25.8s)]
*  Joining me now from where it will kick off in just over an hour, NBC News Capitol Hill [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=28.88s)]
*  correspondent Melanie Zenona. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=32.6s)]
*  Melanie, tell us more about this rally and what you're hearing from folks there. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so this rally obviously comes on the anniversary of D-Day, but it also comes against [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=39.32s)]
*  the backdrop of the Doge cost-cutting mission. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=45.04s)]
*  And I've got to tell you, Chris, there's a lot of concern in talking to veterans about [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=48.0s)]
*  how that cost-cutting mission might impact the Veterans Affairs Department, including [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=51.36s)]
*  critical services like access to health care, which can already be really difficult for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=56.04s)]
*  veterans to receive. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=59.6s)]
*  Now, the administration insists that they are not going to cut any health care or any [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=61.0s)]
*  retirement benefits. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  And Trump's budget for the Veterans Affairs Department does include a proposed increase [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=66.12s)]
*  net overall for the VA. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=70.68s)]
*  But the administration has also admitted that it is looking to streamline the VA, including [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=72.94s)]
*  with as many as 80,000 staff cuts. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  And so the goal of this rally is to really highlight that issue and really start a grassroots [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=80.48s)]
*  movement. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  We're expecting a thousand, as you can see, some veterans already trickling and respecting [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  as many as thousands, 2000 veterans to descend on the Capitol today. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  There's going to be speakers on the stage behind me, also a performance from the punk [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=94.52s)]
*  rock band, Dropkick Murphy's. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=98.24s)]
*  And it's all happening with the Capitol directly behind them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  And Chris, that is the audience that these veterans are hoping to reach because it's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=104.12s)]
*  Congress that has the power, ultimately, at the end of the day to either stop these cuts [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=108.08s)]
*  or to green light those cuts. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=112.56s)]
*  And in the next few months, there is going to be a spending showdown on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=114.16s)]
*  So that is where we're expecting a lot of these issues, including potential staff cuts [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=117.64s)]
*  to the VA to play out. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=121.88s)]
*  Melanie Zanona, thank you for that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=124.0s)]
*  Now I want to bring in Chris Purdy, U.S. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=125.88s)]
*  Army National Guard veteran and CEO of the Chamberlain Network, a veterans empowerment [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=127.84s)]
*  organization and also a lead organizer of today's rally. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=132.68s)]
*  Chris, thanks for coming on. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=136.68s)]
*  Tell us about the rally. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=138.16s)]
*  What's at risk here that you think that they had to organize this? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=139.32s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=145.0s)]
*  This is about jobs, about health care, absolutely. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=146.88s)]
*  But really, at the heart of it, what we are out there, you know, rallying for is our [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=149.56s)]
*  democracy, because what we know is, you know, the executive is cutting these jobs that are [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  going to impact the veteran community, people like me who served after 9-11 and gave so [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=158.88s)]
*  much for this country. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=163.68s)]
*  And what we're telling the president and the administration is if you're going to do [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=164.88s)]
*  this, you can't just do it unilaterally. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=169.88s)]
*  It needs to go through the people's house, needs to go through Congress, and the people [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  need to have a voice in this process. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  So we're out there today. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=177.72s)]
*  It's going to be a great show. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  We're really proud that Dropkick Murphy's is going to be there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  We have lots of veterans and veterans service organizations, Iraq and Afghanistan, Vets [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=183.92s)]
*  America, Burn Pits 360, lots of other groups who have been part of this movement for a [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  long time are coming out and showing support. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=193.6s)]
*  So we're excited. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  Since the cuts began, I wonder what you've been hearing from fellow veterans. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=197.72s)]
*  Yeah, well, I could just tell you my own personal experience. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=202.6s)]
*  I'm a U.S. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=205.32s)]
*  Army veteran, as I said, and I get my cuts, I get my health care through the VA and I'm [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=207.44s)]
*  there almost every week for a variety of issues. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  And when I walk through the halls, I hear it on the lips of the service providers, the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=216.28s)]
*  health care workers. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=222.36s)]
*  They're nervous. They're very concerned. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=224.12s)]
*  They're talking about the cuts. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=226.28s)]
*  They're talking about the things that they are seeing that this administration is doing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=227.72000000000003s)]
*  And I've been going to the VA for years and I've never heard health care providers talk [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=233.52s)]
*  politics. And now it's all I can hear about. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=238.08s)]
*  And if you can look me in the eye and tell me that that's not impacting the quality of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=239.84s)]
*  care, I just I just don't think anybody can do that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=243.52s)]
*  I wouldn't believe if they tried. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=246.24s)]
*  So it's quality of care. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=247.44000000000003s)]
*  It's our benefits and it's our it's our broader democracy that we're out there protesting [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=249.36s)]
*  for. Let me show you some recent headlines. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  Recent months, February, Defense Secretary Hegseth says the Pentagon will cut roughly [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=256.08000000000004s)]
*  50 billion dollars from nonlethal programs in April. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=260.72s)]
*  Another five billion plus from what Hegseth called wasteful contracts. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=264.44s)]
*  Just yesterday, members of Congress were visibly frustrated that plans to modernize the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  army that were submitted didn't have a budget blueprint. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=275.16s)]
*  Do these things help accomplish the administration's stated goal, which is to strengthen the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=279.48s)]
*  military and our national security? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=283.92s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not sure how one cuts the military and cuts veterans care and think that's [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=287.04s)]
*  actually going to help this country. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=293.12s)]
*  What we should be investing in is the services for our veterans and ensuring that the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=294.6s)]
*  military has what it needs to get the job done. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=301.2s)]
*  I just don't see how you can reduce the size of the army, for example, with all that's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=303.24s)]
*  going on right now and still expect to accomplish the mission. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=307.52s)]
*  In just over a week, Washington, D.C. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=311.32s)]
*  will host what President Trump is calling a once in a lifetime military parade. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=313.68s)]
*  It marks the 250th anniversary of the U.S. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  Army and also his birthday at an estimated cost of 25 to 45 million dollars, depending [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=321.56s)]
*  on who's doing the estimate. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=328.2s)]
*  What are your thoughts given the cuts that you're protesting today? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I'll be honest with you, I could care less about the parade. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=333.84s)]
*  I mean, I'm an army vet. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=336.52000000000004s)]
*  It's the army's birthday. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm proud of that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=339.44s)]
*  But 50 million dollars on a parade, I'm not going to be here. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  What I'm concerned about is what that 50 million dollars could have been used, right? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=344.76s)]
*  Cutting, they recently cut a program that would help veterans and housing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=348.16s)]
*  So there's 90,000 veterans that are at risk of losing their home. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=352.88s)]
*  And this mortgage assistance program could have been funded through the money that is [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  now being spent on the parade. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=360.72s)]
*  So that's what I'm looking at. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  Whether or not he gets a birthday parade, that's that's that's on him. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=363.64s)]
*  But I would really have rather seen that money go toward actual veterans services. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=366.96s)]
*  Are you saying the entire mortgage assistance program could have been funded? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=370.68s)]
*  I can get you the exact numbers, but the vast program was cut and there are 90,000 [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=376.28s)]
*  veterans who are at risk of losing their homes. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=381.4s)]
*  This is the program that helped 17,000 veterans last year stay in their homes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=383.44s)]
*  And it was cut with, I think, eight days notice. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=389.28s)]
*  And all of that money could have been going to to the program to keep veterans in their [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  homes at the risk of losing their mortgages. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=396.92s)]
*  Chris Purdy, thank you for your service and thank you so much for coming on the program. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLeR9Hpxh3M&t=401.52000000000004s)]
