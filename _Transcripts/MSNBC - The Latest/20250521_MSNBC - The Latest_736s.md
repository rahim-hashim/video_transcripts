# 'Hypocrisy of the highest order': Castro on charges against McIver after Trump pardoned Jan. 6ers
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0)
*  Let's get right to MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin, NYU law professor and former Manhattan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=0.0s)]
*  Assistant District Attorney Rebecca Roife, former Obama HUD Secretary Julian Castro, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  and Jason Hauser, who was chief of staff at ICE during the Biden administration. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Okay, thanks for all coming on here. Lisa, let me start with you. Explain what's going to happen [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=16.0s)]
*  at this hearing today. We mentioned Bale. She's not been arrested. She's not behind bars. So, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=21.52s)]
*  why is Bale involved here? Well, she has on a willingly surrendered herself to processing [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=26.08s)]
*  this morning, and part of today's hearing, in addition to reading out the charges and advising [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  her of her rights, are setting the conditions for her not being detained prior to trial. Now, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  she won't be entering a plea today because there is no indictment or information. This is solely [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=42.48s)]
*  a criminal complaint, which means basically it is a list of the charges and an affidavit from a law [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=47.68s)]
*  enforcement officer pulling together his own personal knowledge and things that he's seen, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=53.2s)]
*  for example, on the videos or read and describing what happened during that day. In order to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=57.2s)]
*  progress this case, within 30 days, the Department of Justice needs to bring an indictment, which [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=62.64s)]
*  means they have to convene a grand jury and have it vote a true bill. Now, we have learned that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=67.2s)]
*  the standard protocol wasn't necessarily followed when it came to filing this criminal complaint. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=72.72s)]
*  Can you remind us what is the standard protocol here? Yeah, the standard protocol comes from the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=79.28s)]
*  justice manual. It's like the Bible for federal prosecutors. It says that when you bring a charge [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=83.44s)]
*  against a sitting member of Congress, you have to do two things. One, you have to consult with the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=87.76s)]
*  public integrity unit at main justice with respect to any investigative steps. And then before you [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  bring those charges, you actually have to get approval from the public integrity unit. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=98.08s)]
*  The problem here is the public integrity unit has been decimated. It used to have several dozen [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  people in it. Current reporting says there are maybe fewer than five people in that unit. And [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=106.8s)]
*  our colleagues at NBC reported yesterday, based on a source familiar with the matter, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=112.64s)]
*  that those protocols were not observed in this case. And so, Rebecca, do you see anything in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=116.8s)]
*  this situation that would suggest that it is valid not to follow standard protocol in this specific [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  case? No, I mean, I think in cases like this, this is when you especially want to see that prosecutors [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=128.64s)]
*  are following these standard procedures, because this is what it's not like, you know, the procedures [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=134.56s)]
*  in your office that are like, you know, refill the coffee pot. It's actually meant to ensure that we, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=139.2s)]
*  as the public, can see that this is not a politically motivated or improper prosecution. This is how [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=145.52s)]
*  we're reassured that that's the case. And if they don't follow protocols in a politically charged [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=150.88s)]
*  case, that's a big red flag. So back to what is typical, we've also learned that the interim [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=155.76s)]
*  U.S. attorney, Lena Haba, met with Congresswoman MacGyver before these criminal charges were filed, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=162.8s)]
*  and according to the Congresswoman, that she was trying to get her to admit to some of these [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  actions, which she declined to do. And we've heard that there will be additional meetings with other [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  members of Congress who were there on that day, including Bonnie Watson Coleman, who I just spoke [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  to last hour. She says she's planned to meet with the Lena Haba's office tomorrow. Is that typical? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=184.96s)]
*  Again, this is not typical. And the reason why it's not typical is because we normally want to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=190.72s)]
*  see quite a separation between the people within the Department of Justice who have the closest [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=195.12s)]
*  political ties and those who are bringing these sorts of cases. And that's why we like to see the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=201.2s)]
*  public integrity unit that has a full institutional knowledge about how prosecutors normally act to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=205.76s)]
*  ensure that we think the public looks at it and says, well, this is being treated like cases are [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=212.72s)]
*  being treated alike. All of these deviations are concerning because they make it look like [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=217.12s)]
*  this is part of a political message rather than a simple, straightforward prosecution. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=222.24s)]
*  Well, and MacGyver has called it political intimidation. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=227.84s)]
*  Well, again, I mean, I think you want to be careful about listening to political actors [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=230.72s)]
*  in a situation like this, because of course they're always going to scream. You know, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=234.56s)]
*  when something happens that's against you or your political party, you're going to say this is [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=238.16s)]
*  politically motivated. This is why we should never pay attention to any of them. And the people we [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=241.52s)]
*  should pay attention to are the career prosecutors within the Department of Justice who have the least [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=245.6s)]
*  political motivation and who have the most established standard practices when it comes [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=250.48s)]
*  to something like this. Those are the people we should be listening to. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=256.08s)]
*  Secretary Castro, here's how Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman described the situation, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=258.56s)]
*  which she was a part of when I spoke with her last hour. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=263.6s)]
*  We were in the middle of the crush. You have to recognize that around 20 fatigued dress [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=268.48s)]
*  masked and weaponized individuals came at us at the same time. So it was an issue of close contact, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=276.0s)]
*  but mostly we just did not want anyone to be crushing us. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  And she kept saying, please don't touch me. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=290.88s)]
*  So Secretary Castro, President Trump pardoned January 6 rioters who physically assaulted [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  police officers, calling those assaults very minor incidents. The double standard seems [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=300.4s)]
*  glaringly obvious here, no? Well, it's hypocrisy of the highest order, Anna. And I expect ultimately [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=306.96s)]
*  that these charges, if they go forward, they're going to be thrown out. But maybe most importantly, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=314.79999999999995s)]
*  they're part of a disturbing pattern of political intimidation and trying to silence dissent in this [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=319.76s)]
*  country. We think about Judge Dugan in Wisconsin that was charged. Think about these student [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=326.32s)]
*  activists that were charged or had their visas removed for, among other things, writing an op-ed, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=332.64s)]
*  expressing their opinion. The real effort here by Trump is to create a chilling effect, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=338.32s)]
*  to show people if we can squelch even the most powerful people, even judges, even members of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=345.12s)]
*  Congress, then you don't have any hope of dissenting against me or my administration. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=351.76s)]
*  I think that's the real effort of this administration. And it's galling that this is a man that pardoned [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  the January 6 rioters who hurt police officers, who tried to stop a legitimate election. And then [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=364.08s)]
*  now to say that Representative McIver and Representative Watson Coleman, who, by the way, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=375.68s)]
*  is 80 years old, and if you notice, Representative McIver was trying to help her to make sure she [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  didn't get hurt. They were there legitimately because, as many people have pointed out, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=386.24s)]
*  congressional members have a right to go and do oversight like this. So it's hypocrisy and it's [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=391.12s)]
*  part of a broader effort that shows, once again, the authoritarian impulses of Donald Trump and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=399.2s)]
*  his administration. Jason, anyone who's looking at this video sees chaos. Congress [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=405.2s)]
*  woman McIver told MSNBC those same ICE agents she's now charged with assaulting accompanied [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=411.2s)]
*  her once she was allowed to actually tour the facility after all of this unfolded. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=417.52s)]
*  What is the appropriate role for ICE agents in this situation, and does it appear they followed [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  protocol? Yes, ma'am. What I think you see here is the consequences and the outcomes of chaos [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=428.08s)]
*  from the administration. And now that chaos from the White House when it comes to immigration is [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  playing out in our communities. In front of the Delaney Hall, you had a situation where there was [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=442.88s)]
*  protesters about the opening of the facility. You had the Congress members carrying out their [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=448.88s)]
*  legal authorities to do oversight on the facility, which in my role as chief of staff and working [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=455.20000000000005s)]
*  within the Department of Homeland Security, I've executed and oversaw hundreds of different visits [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  bipartisanly. And that's the duties that they're to carry out. What you have here is ICE agents in [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=464.88s)]
*  a situation where they're responding to the crowd, they're responding to the members trying to get [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=470.88s)]
*  into the facility. And you're quite frankly, you're putting both the congressional members [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=476.48s)]
*  and the ICE officers in an extremely dangerous place. And it is very disturbing to see that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=480.96s)]
*  Homeland Security investigation officers, enforcement removal operators are even having [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=487.52s)]
*  to spend their time in this situation. But it is from the outcomes of erratic, sporadic, and some, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=494.08000000000004s)]
*  quite frankly, illegal sort of immigration directives coming from this White House. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=500.88s)]
*  And I fear over the next few months, as you continue to see these artificial quotas for [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=505.20000000000005s)]
*  arrests of non-criminals, non-removable migrants, people being brought out of legal immigration [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=510.64000000000004s)]
*  status, and more and more immigration detention facilities being brought online, taxing the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=516.4s)]
*  resources of ICE officers, you're going to see more and more of this. But what we need [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=521.68s)]
*  is Congress to have the ability to do the proper oversight to both protect migrants [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=526.56s)]
*  and protect the law enforcement officers. Secretary, should the Speaker of the House [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=530.4s)]
*  be doing more to defend Congress's oversight authority? That is why Congressman McIver [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=534.64s)]
*  says she was there in the first place. Yeah, well, I was happy to see that at least, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=539.92s)]
*  you know, Minority Leader Jeffries right away that evening made a statement on this and has been very [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  forcefully pushing for that authority to be recognized. So I hope that Speaker Johnson does [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=554.4s)]
*  do that. Look, there's a bigger point here. Congress, whether you're Democrat or Republican, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  have a role to play in oversight, and that role needs to be respected. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=565.52s)]
*  But, Anna, you know, it wouldn't surprise me if he didn't say anything, because what we've seen [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=570.0s)]
*  is Congress completely roll over time and again. These congressional Republicans [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=573.36s)]
*  not want to stand up to Donald Trump and completely let him get away with stepping all over Congress. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=577.52s)]
*  So, you know, I'm not holding my breath for that. Jason, let's listen to how [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=583.6s)]
*  Borders R. Tom Homan described the altercation yesterday with our colleague Chris Jancy. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=588.08s)]
*  We have many Congressmen visit our facilities. What she did was unprofessional. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=595.76s)]
*  Do you believe that she was a threat? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=600.64s)]
*  I believe she caused the facility to be unsafe. When an ICE officer being pulled off their duties [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=603.68s)]
*  to deal with a member of Congress who's forced away in the facility and puts ICE, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  and puts her hands on an ICE officer is unprofessional. I think she crossed the line. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=612.8s)]
*  Jason, you brought up this point about the danger that was created, regardless of whose [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=619.52s)]
*  fault it was or who did what, who instigated it, did what we see jeopardized safety at that [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=625.76s)]
*  ICE facility. And what needs to happen to avoid that moving forward? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=633.2s)]
*  One, ma'am, from what I saw Thomas off base a bit, the ICE officers are trained to assess risk [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8DEJCogy0&t=639.68s)]
