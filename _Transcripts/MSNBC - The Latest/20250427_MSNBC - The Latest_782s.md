Video Description: The Trump admin continues to attack DEI, targeting museums dedicated to Black history. Dr. Tracie Therence Ferrell reminds us that this history is vital and more current than people realize. “This is history that is happening now,” says Dr. Ferrell. “My family is not even one generation removed from a slave plantation.” And yet these important stories are at risk of erasure. “What this administration is trying to do is not just erase parts of history, but actually erase the very idea of history and knowledge in the service of mythology,” says Harvard professor Imani Perry.

# Erasing History: Trump’s cuts to federal grants threaten Black history museums
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI)
*  According to a study by the National Humanities Center, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=0.0s)]
*  by the start of the Civil War in 1860, there were more [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=2.7s)]
*  than 46,000 plantations or estates with at least 20 [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=6.18s)]
*  enslaved people functioning across the south. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=10.32s)]
*  Forty-six thousand. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=13.42s)]
*  There were roughly three thousand plantations with [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=15.18s)]
*  more than one hundred enslaved people. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=17.26s)]
*  Today, hundreds of these sites remain as private [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=19.42s)]
*  homes, wedding venues, bed and breakfasts, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=21.96s)]
*  and tourist attractions. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=24.62s)]
*  Many of them romanticize or sanitize their version [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=26.2s)]
*  of history as a part of the antebellum south. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=29.9s)]
*  There's only one plantation museum that exists today [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=33.94s)]
*  that focuses solely on the experiences and the stories [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=36.14s)]
*  of those who were enslaved. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=39.28s)]
*  That is the Whitney Plantation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=40.94s)]
*  Since 1752, the Whitney Plantation has gone [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=42.78s)]
*  through a series of evolutions. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=45.68s)]
*  It began as an indigo plantation where at least 20 [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=47.68s)]
*  enslaved people from West Africa were forced to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=50.78s)]
*  produce indigo dyes. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=53.28s)]
*  The estate later grew into a massive sugar plantation [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=55.12s)]
*  with over one hundred enslaved people working the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=58.14s)]
*  fields and carrying out physically demanding work. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=60.68s)]
*  Even after the Civil War, even after the emancipation [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=64.52s)]
*  proclamation, many former slaves remained on the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=67.56s)]
*  same plantations. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=70.86s)]
*  With no money, no land, and the threat of violence [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=72.56s)]
*  from their former enslavers, many former slaves had [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=75.25999999999999s)]
*  no choice but to stay as sharecroppers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=78.16s)]
*  These systems that entrenched deep poverty left [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=80.9s)]
*  many descendants of enslaved people with few [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=83.9s)]
*  options. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=86.22s)]
*  At the Whitney Plantation, some black families [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=87.2s)]
*  labored on the land well into the 1950s and 60s. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=89.4s)]
*  Today, the Whitney Plantation Museum is [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=93.76s)]
*  dedicated to telling the histories of the people who [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=95.84s)]
*  were enslaved there, to honoring the lives lost [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=98.64s)]
*  and the lives stolen. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=101.4s)]
*  The museum honors the skill and culture of those who [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  lived and labored and resisted against the systems [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=105.98s)]
*  that kept them from their true freedom. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=109.28s)]
*  In the words of the executive director of the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=111.78s)]
*  Whitney Plantation, the museum is, quote, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=115.24s)]
*  in the long fight for justice, for truth, and for memory. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=117.44s)]
*  Yet the Trump administration's focus on eliminating [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=122.92s)]
*  diversity, equity, and inclusion from American life [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=125.52s)]
*  has been sweeping, targeting funding for government [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=128.06s)]
*  programs, for schools, for museums, for anything [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=130.57999999999998s)]
*  related to race, gender, or economic equality. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=133.7s)]
*  The president threatened to cut funding for any school [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=136.76s)]
*  that maintained what he called discriminatory [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=139.36s)]
*  equity ideology. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=142.5s)]
*  It's not even a thing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  And his administration cut funding for multiple museums [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  that focus on non-white American histories, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=148.72s)]
*  particularly programs and museums that focus on [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=150.9s)]
*  Native American and black history. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=153.66000000000003s)]
*  Earlier this month, the Trump administration [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  announced funding cuts to the Institute of Museum [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=158.84s)]
*  and Library Services that included two grants [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=161.86s)]
*  that were intended for the Whitney Plantation Museum. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  The agency said that the museum and the programs [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=167.94s)]
*  that the grants were meant to fund no longer aligned [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  with the agency's priorities and did not serve [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=173.96s)]
*  the interest of the United States. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=176.6s)]
*  Now let's be very clear about something. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=178.8s)]
*  Telling the full history of this country is absolutely [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=180.18s)]
*  in our best interest, and what is not in our interest [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=183.28s)]
*  is erasing black American foundational history. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=186.56s)]
*  Joining me now is Dr. Imani Perry, professor of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=191.24s)]
*  African American Studies at Harvard University [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=193.8s)]
*  and bestselling author of multiple important books, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=196.04s)]

*  of Insight Network Incorporated Nonprofit Foundation [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=207.66s)]
*  and author of Life on the Whitney Plantation, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  100 Years After Slavery. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=213.9s)]
*  Tracy, you are someone who literally wrote the book [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=216.22s)]
*  and has a deep and personal connection [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=219.06s)]
*  to the Whitney Plantation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=221.84s)]
*  You and your mother co-authored the book, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=223.3s)]
*  Life on the Whitney Plantation, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=225.38s)]
*  it tells your mother's story where she was born [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=226.7s)]
*  and raised on the Whitney Plantation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=229.06s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit about her journey? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=231.72s)]
*  Sure, first of all, thank you all for having me on the show. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=236.36s)]
*  I am such a fan of your forward leaning special program, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=239.24s)]
*  and it's an honor and pleasure to be here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  With the book, My Mother, Vernita Gillard and I, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  we decided to write this history of our family [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=249.96s)]
*  that lived, worked, and some that tragically died [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=253.16s)]
*  in the harsh conditions of Whitney Plantation. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=258.38000000000005s)]
*  First off, to commemorate their resilience and strength, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=261.18s)]
*  and secondly, because the plantation was turned [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=266.26000000000005s)]
*  into a museum, we wanted to have that history documented [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=268.78000000000003s)]
*  at this plantation museum. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=272.86s)]
*  It is very important to us because not only [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=276.0s)]
*  is it our family history, this is history [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  that's happening now, not in the antebellum period. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=282.66s)]
*  We're talking about my family that's not even [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=286.64s)]
*  one generation removed from a slave plantation [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=290.8s)]
*  and all they had endured living there and working there. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=293.96s)]
*  So Dr. Perry, for so many people who are looking at this [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=299.56s)]
*  and thinking, well, slavery was a long time ago, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=305.2s)]
*  why are we still talking about this? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=309.24s)]
*  Why does this have to be a part [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=311.36s)]
*  of the history that we learned? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=313.72s)]
*  Can you connect the dots in such a way [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=315.56s)]
*  that impresses upon our audience members [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=318.32s)]
*  the significance of what it is to erase the history [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=321.46000000000004s)]
*  of foundational black people in this country [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=325.56s)]
*  from the story of America? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=328.12s)]
*  Right, I mean, first of all, I'm so grateful [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=331.88s)]
*  to be with you and also so grateful for the testimony [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  that Tracy offered because I think she actually explained [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=336.8s)]
*  precisely the point. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=340.0s)]
*  We cannot actually understand the story of this nation [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=343.34000000000003s)]
*  without the story of black Americans. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=346.3s)]
*  History can potentially be a moral instrument. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=348.74s)]
*  It can be something that allows us to look into the past, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=351.66s)]
*  understand both the virtues and the vices [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=354.58000000000004s)]
*  that give us information about how we ought [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=357.82s)]
*  to conduct ourselves in the present moment. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  We know all of the wealth of the United States [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=362.26s)]
*  had some in the antebellum period was centrally connected [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=365.1s)]
*  to the unfree labor of black people. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=369.14000000000004s)]
*  On the Whitney plantation, part of what you see [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=371.52s)]
*  is not simply the impact of generations of exploitation [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=374.4s)]
*  and unfreedom, but you also see the incredible body [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=379.24s)]
*  of knowledge, of skill that was required of people [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=382.92s)]
*  who were enslaved. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=386.24s)]
*  You can see, I mean, to go through Indigo and sugar [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=387.56s)]
*  and rice and it teaches about all of the different kinds [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=390.54s)]
*  of farming that took place there. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=393.8s)]
*  And that really is the story of the country. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=396.44s)]
*  And I'm afraid that part of what this administration [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=400.58s)]
*  is trying to do is not just erase parts of history, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=403.54s)]
*  but actually to erase the very idea of history [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=406.82s)]
*  and knowledge in the service of mythology. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=409.38s)]
*  You have to wonder why they are so desperate [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=411.82s)]
*  to have a public that is not informed, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=414.14s)]
*  that is not knowledgeable, that can't actually figure out [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=417.54s)]
*  where we come from as a part of how we decide [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=420.74s)]
*  about where we ought to go in the future. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=423.3s)]
*  Tracey, you gave such a moving account of the reason [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=425.98s)]
*  why you and your mother were motivated [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=430.72s)]
*  to put this book together. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=432.72s)]
*  When you meet people and you are having conversations, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=434.12s)]
*  particularly within the context of what's going on today, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=437.04s)]
*  what's the most important thing that you try to convey [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=440.56s)]
*  about her legacy and what it represents [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=443.44s)]
*  in terms of the larger story of black Americans [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=446.26s)]
*  in this country? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=448.98s)]
*  Well, like Dr. Perry just mentioned, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  it's a historical device here that we have. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=454.24s)]
*  I try to convey to people this tragic situation, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=459.04s)]
*  as sad as it was, it also brings immense strength and pride [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=466.08s)]
*  in me and my family that we were able to persevere [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=473.06s)]
*  and be resilient in these harsh conditions. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  And at the same time, as a people be able to contribute [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=482.0s)]
*  to a massive wealth, as Dr. Perry highlighted, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=487.08s)]
*  a massive wealth brought to the economy of Louisiana [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=491.88s)]
*  and also in turn to our country. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=496.4s)]
*  And when you have these conversations, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=500.6s)]
*  do you find, Tracey, that people are surprised? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=502.34s)]
*  Do you find that people are ignorant [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=506.08s)]
*  to some of this information? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=508.26s)]
*  What is their reaction when you tell the story? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=509.64s)]
*  Not just of your mother, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=512.32s)]
*  but of the Whitney plantation as a whole? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=513.16s)]
*  Yes, I think you hit the nail on the head, sir. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=517.48s)]
*  When I tell people about the situation or the history, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=521.6s)]
*  they say, are you for certain? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=525.08s)]
*  Your mom was in the antebellum period? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=527.28s)]
*  Like, no, this is happening now in our generation. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=529.6s)]
*  That's why the title is Life on Whitney Plantation, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=532.86s)]
*  100 Years After Slavery, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=536.04s)]
*  which you can find at the whitneyplantation.org site. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=538.36s)]
*  But yes, they're shocked. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=542.48s)]
*  I even had one younger cousin at a university [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=544.52s)]
*  in the seminar, one of his classes, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=548.64s)]
*  they talked about plantation life. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=550.76s)]
*  And he said, oh yeah, my grandmother lived [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=553.6800000000001s)]
*  on that plantation. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=555.8000000000001s)]
*  And they, the college professor, the students, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=557.08s)]
*  they said, are you sure? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=560.12s)]
*  The same thing I get. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=562.9200000000001s)]
*  We're talking about the antebellum period. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=563.76s)]
*  He's like, no, she was one of the last of the families [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=565.04s)]
*  to live on this plantation this day and age. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=569.4s)]
*  So people are shocked to hear that, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=571.88s)]
*  are shocked to hear that my grandmother, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=573.76s)]
*  who was one of my best friends, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=575.3199999999999s)]
*  watched her mother die in child labor [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=577.0s)]
*  while giving birth in those impoverished conditions [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  on that plantation. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=585.04s)]
*  Yes, this is stuff that was happening this day and age. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=586.48s)]
*  And usually I tell them, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=590.12s)]
*  you see some narratives of what occurred [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  in the last few decades. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=595.88s)]
*  And I tell them, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=597.2800000000001s)]
*  I know that there's been all the dastardly mistreatment [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=598.12s)]
*  of enslaved people during the plantation life, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=601.24s)]
*  but you don't read about sometimes [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=604.6800000000001s)]
*  what were the ramifications of that on their descendants. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=607.88s)]
*  So I aimed, and my mother aimed, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=613.12s)]
*  to capture that in this book. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=616.32s)]
*  Picking up on that very point, Dr. Perry, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=619.6s)]
*  is something that really strikes to me [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=623.76s)]
*  as the crux of the matter. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=626.4s)]
*  In order to understand structurally [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=628.24s)]
*  how these things have had an impact [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=630.0799999999999s)]
*  on things like economic inequality, generational poverty, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=631.92s)]
*  and other sort of constraints, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=636.24s)]
*  even environmental racism, for example, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=638.16s)]
*  when you don't tell these anecdotes [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=641.12s)]
*  and connect them to these systems, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=643.4799999999999s)]
*  people are not able to understand [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=645.8399999999999s)]
*  the lingering impact and effect. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=648.1999999999999s)]
*  But in your opinion, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  when you see these attacks, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=651.96s)]
*  is that partially the point or the intent [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=653.36s)]
*  of why there's such an effort to erase this history? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=656.64s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=662.96s)]
*  I mean, this is, when we talk about Louisiana, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=663.96s)]
*  we're talking about cancer alley. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=666.88s)]
*  When you have a history of devaluing people, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  one of the consequences is that then [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=671.8000000000001s)]
*  all of the suffering in our society [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=674.36s)]
*  is distributed in ways that allow various kinds [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=679.4s)]
*  of injustice to accumulate in certain populations. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=683.08s)]
*  So absolutely, there is a discourse that implies [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=685.92s)]
*  that the efforts to address the history [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=689.52s)]
*  and the ongoing impact of racial inequality [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=691.92s)]
*  is somehow racist in and of itself, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=694.28s)]
*  which is just, I mean, beyond wrong. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=697.44s)]
*  I mean, it's horrifying to suggest [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=700.24s)]
*  that when you have generations of people [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=702.04s)]
*  who at first have their labor, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  the value of their labor go to others, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=708.08s)]
*  and then for generations after to be exploited. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=709.84s)]
*  And then literally within, you know, I'm 52 years old. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=712.92s)]
*  It's within my lifetime that is the first steps [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=716.88s)]
*  that we're moving towards addressing generations [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=720.36s)]
*  of that kind of inequality, generations of that injustice, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=723.76s)]
*  and that now people are suggesting that somehow [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=726.96s)]
*  that effort to address that inequality is unfair. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=730.48s)]
*  You know, it's horrifying. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=734.68s)]
*  And we also continue to see the lingering impact. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=736.56s)]
*  And in some instances, it's an echoing [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=740.7199999999999s)]
*  and it's a vast impact of generations of inequality [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=743.04s)]
*  on health outcomes, on education outcomes, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=746.92s)]
*  on opportunities of various sorts. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=749.68s)]
*  So yes, they are absolutely trying to distract [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=751.4799999999999s)]
*  from that fact, but also trying to teach a false narrative [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=753.52s)]
*  about what this country is and has done [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=757.3199999999999s)]
*  so that people will be completely confused [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=759.64s)]
*  both inside and outside our community. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=762.8399999999999s)]
*  So I'm so grateful that we're having this conversation [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=764.56s)]
*  because it has a large potential impact. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=767.52s)]
*  A large potential impact indeed, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=770.4399999999999s)]
*  perhaps one of the most important conversations [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=772.2399999999999s)]
*  that we will have all day, if not for longer. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=774.4s)]
*  Thank you both Dr. Imani Perry [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=777.04s)]
*  and Tracy Terence-Farrell for being here. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubViuwXLlYI&t=779.1199999999999s)]
