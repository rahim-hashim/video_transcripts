# 'Brain drain': Why the loss of international students will have reverberations on the economy
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0)
*  And joining us now MSNBC's Antonia Hilton from Cambridge, Massachusetts. MSNBC legal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=0.0s)]
*  correspondent Lisa Rubin, MSNBC contributor Charlie Sykes and former Massachusetts congressman [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  and former special envoy to Northern Ireland Joe Kennedy. Lisa, you've been monitoring [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  the hearing. I understand they're in recess right now. There was this 11th hour filing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=16.64s)]
*  What came of it? It sounds like the judge, Ana, isn't buying this 11th hour filing as [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=21.46s)]
*  something that changes the posture of the case. And let me just review what the administration [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=26.78s)]
*  filed. It was a letter that they sent Harvard yesterday informing them of their intent to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=30.42s)]
*  terminate their ability to enroll foreign students. And if that makes you say, hey, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=36.34s)]
*  wait a second, didn't they already do that? They did. But what they said previously was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=40.46s)]
*  we're going to immediately revoke your ability to enroll foreign students now and for the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=45.18000000000001s)]
*  future. Now the administration has sort of taken a step back and sent Harvard the kind [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  of letter they should have sent originally referring to the regulatory framework for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=54.62s)]
*  how you are properly supposed to terminate a university's enrollment in what's called [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  CEVP. That's the program that allows any university throughout the country to enroll foreign students [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=64.62s)]
*  who aren't here on immigrant visas, but rather permission to study here in the country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=70.25999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the student and exchange visitor program. That's correct. And so the judge saying this [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=75.02s)]
*  morning, yeah, maybe the administration did the right thing and sent this letter, but [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=78.38s)]
*  there is so much uncertainty around the program. The fact that they did this at the 11th hour [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=83.42s)]
*  theoretically to ward off my preliminary injunction doesn't change the fact that there are foreign [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=88.30000000000001s)]
*  students at Harvard or who are about to enroll in Harvard for whom this has caused all kinds [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=93.22s)]
*  of confusion. I am inclined to extend my temporary restraining order that I entered last week. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=98.72s)]
*  That means until and unless further notice, Harvard is in the same situation with an ability [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=104.92s)]
*  to enroll foreign students and the administration can't do anything about it according to this [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=110.54s)]
*  judge. Yeah, the judge sounds like she was quite concerned about the harm that these [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=115.34s)]
*  students may be experiencing. Absolutely. And for her this morning, at least according [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=120.18s)]
*  to our colleague, Gary Grumbach, who is in federal court in Boston this morning, the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=125.34s)]
*  judge's real concern was less about Harvard and more about these foreign students who [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=129.1s)]
*  we know from reporting, including Antonia's are really facing sort of a Sophie's choice, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=133.4s)]
*  right? They don't know where to enroll, when they can enroll, whether they should go back [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=139.58s)]
*  to their home countries and participate in higher education there. This has caused an [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=145.10000000000002s)]
*  endless source of confusion for foreign students at Harvard. And there are a considerable number [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=149.66000000000003s)]
*  of them. As the president himself said earlier this week, he said that there were 31% of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=154.62s)]
*  Harvard students are from outside the country. We understand that to be closer to 27%. But [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=160.14000000000001s)]
*  still, that's a sizable number of students enrolled at Harvard who come from countries [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=164.58s)]
*  outside the U.S. and with permission to study here provided by the U.S. government. And [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=169.78s)]
*  we are told that hearing just concluded. I'll let you read in to get a sense of what's next [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=174.38000000000002s)]
*  in it. Antonia Harvard says that President Trump's actions have already made students [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  afraid, afraid to attend today's commencement, their own graduation. So I have to wonder [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=183.62s)]
*  even if Harvard prevails, is that fear factor already present there in Cambridge in some ways? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  Has the damage already been done? Anna, absolutely. The fear factor is present on Cambridge and in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=196.66000000000003s)]
*  Cambridge. And I think it is going to stay around for quite a while because no matter what happens [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=204.58s)]
*  in this one part of the fight, there are several fronts of this sort of Trump versus Harvard war, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  from additional funding cuts on their way to verbal sort of threats that he's made and insults [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=216.46s)]
*  that he's lodged against people here at the university. So the feeling is that if it's not [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  this, it will always be something else over the course of the next three and a half years. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=226.9s)]
*  To give you just a sense, while of course most of the people here are in a good mood, they're [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=231.82s)]
*  excited to celebrate, to reflect on their last several years here on campus. Many of the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=236.22s)]
*  international students that we've spoken to this morning have told us that they cannot go on camera. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=241.3s)]
*  They're afraid that the administration will see them on our air and perhaps snatch their visa away [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=245.26s)]
*  or something could happen to them. So that is a very real sentiment. Take a listen to a conversation [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=250.94s)]
*  I had with the mom of one American graduate who works in a quantum physics lab with primarily [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=255.5s)]
*  international students. But more generally, he's in a physics lab with a lot of international [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=261.58s)]
*  students and many of them are looking elsewhere, either to other top schools in the U.S. or [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=268.94s)]
*  to schools outside the U.S. And that is really sad because these are the top minds who would [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=275.98s)]
*  otherwise be educated at Harvard. The challenge though, Ana, is that there are international [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=281.1s)]
*  students who cannot return home for various reasons. There may be a war happening in the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=288.54s)]
*  place that they call home or they may themselves be fearful of political persecution in their home [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=293.74s)]
*  country. And so in addition to just figuring out, well, can I stay literally here in Cambridge, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=300.14s)]
*  Massachusetts, there's concern about, well, what happens if I actually do go overseas? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=304.74s)]
*  And then for American students, they are still facing the major funding cuts. So the son of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  the woman you just met there, he works in a lab that is in the process of losing its funding. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=314.97999999999996s)]
*  So as he graduates, he's actually going to go over to Princeton to continue doing the kind of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=320.42s)]
*  work that he does because in part that opportunity may not be here at Harvard. And so that's the kind [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=324.34s)]
*  of fear, the kind of consequence that all of this represents, that people are going to essentially [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=330.5s)]
*  be running away from these institutions. And as these fights come from one university down the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=335.54s)]
*  road to the next, they may abandon higher education in the United States as a whole. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=340.42s)]
*  That brain drain is the real risk and fear here, Ana. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=345.22s)]
*  Charlie, what is your reaction to what Antonia is describing there? Is this what Trump voters wanted? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=349.62s)]
*  Well, it's what Donald Trump wants, and this is what he's doing. And of course, the fear is [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=356.66s)]
*  exactly the point. But to that last point, the brain drain here is going to be extraordinary. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=362.26000000000005s)]
*  And look, there are a lot of ways in which higher education needs to be reformed. There's a lot of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=369.06s)]
*  ways in which Harvard needs to be reformed. But this is not about reform. It is about destruction. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=374.58000000000004s)]
*  And the loss of the international students is going to have reverberations throughout, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=379.3s)]
*  not just higher education, but throughout the economy and throughout the world. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  This has really been one of the great investments the federal government has made [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=389.62s)]
*  in building up these research functions in universities like Harvard. And they can't [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=394.74s)]
*  necessarily be replicated. And so the damage is being done in the short term. But the long-term [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=399.94s)]
*  damage is also great. And let me just make one other point. One of the reasons why we have so [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=407.86s)]
*  many foreign students who are playing such a critical role in many of the sciences in higher [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=413.14s)]
*  education is because American education has failed to have enough American students in the pipeline [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=418.18s)]
*  to do many of these specialized, to go into these specialized fields. So the downstream effect of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=425.78s)]
*  this is really great. This is a really historic act of self-sabotage by the Trump administration. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=432.97999999999996s)]
*  Congressman, you attended Harvard Law. And here's what President Trump has said about this [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=440.09999999999997s)]
*  university. He's called it anti-Semitic, far left, a threat to democracy, says it has crazed lunatics, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=445.85999999999996s)]
*  it's a liberal mess. As a Harvard alum, is any of that true? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=452.97999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump has said a lot of things. And I mean, listen, what I would say is on a long list of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=459.29999999999995s)]
*  dumb things this administration has done, this might not be the top one, but it's pretty darn [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=465.46s)]
*  close. Harvard, just as Charlie said, Harvard has needs for reform, higher ed has needs for reform. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=470.5s)]
*  But I'm not sure you could think of a better act of self-sabotage than one, yes, trying to gut [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=476.18s)]
*  some of the premier talent research institutions anywhere in the world with one act coming out of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=483.94s)]
*  the White House, two, at a time when we are in an almost existential race with some of the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=489.22s)]
*  largest competitors, toughest competitors in the world, particularly coming out of China on AI, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=495.22s)]
*  on quantum mechanics and quantum physics, quantum computing, on energy and fusion, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=499.86s)]
*  gutting these research institutions and saying to that talent, actually don't come here, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=505.70000000000005s)]
*  go to China, go elsewhere. And by the way, Chinese have been recruiting scientists and [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=509.86s)]
*  researchers from Massachusetts and from other core research institutions for decades now, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=513.86s)]
*  but giving them added reason to go there couldn't possibly be a dumber thing to do than to try to [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=518.9s)]
*  win an innovation race in the future. But it's not just obviously about Harvard, as Charlie said, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=524.66s)]
*  it's about a higher education ecosystem here. There's extraordinary research and talent at [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=528.98s)]
*  Arizona State, at University of Texas, at Florida, at Michigan, plenty of other places, telling that [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=533.6999999999999s)]
*  talent that wants to come here and help incubate that system of innovation and research to power [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=539.3s)]
*  American thought and business for next generation, telling them you're not welcome, we don't want you, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=545.14s)]
*  why would you possibly do that? And that's just as Antony said, that is the message that is being [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=550.3399999999999s)]
*  sent very clearly, not just to Harvard, but to every other research institution and institution [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=556.18s)]
*  of higher learning across the country. So as I said, not the dumbest thing, but pretty darn close. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=560.42s)]
*  You know, the president has argued that the radical left has taken over our quote, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=565.06s)]
*  once great educational institutions, so talking more broadly, not just about Harvard, members of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=568.9799999999999s)]
*  your family fought radical ideologies throughout history. So what's your response to him in that [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=573.3s)]
*  argument? My namesake is name is on the hall at Memorial Church because he died fighting [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=578.9s)]
*  Germans in World War II. There are Harvard students and folks and alumni have dedicated, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=586.0999999999999s)]
*  many of whom have dedicated their lives to upholding the values and principles and institutions that [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=595.62s)]
*  do in fact make America great and have had made America great for a long, long time. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=601.62s)]
*  The fact that this administration chooses to ignore their sacrifice and their contribution, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=606.02s)]
*  look, that's on Donald Trump, that's on Marco Rubio, I guess, for doing the 180 that he has done. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJepvMc8Ab0&t=609.86s)]
