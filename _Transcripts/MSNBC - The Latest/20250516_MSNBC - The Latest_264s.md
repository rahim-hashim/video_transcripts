*  cross examination prosecutors. They want Ventura off the stand by the end of the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=62.28s)]

*  of their most popular shows. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=81.12s)]
*  Out of me, young lady, could I trouble you for the next dance? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=84.92s)]
*  That's right. You guessed it. Richardson. They're coming back, but not just for [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=91.12s)]
*  one but two more seasons. And if you're in a political scandal, which I bet you [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=95.12s)]
*  are buckle up because the diplomat starring Carrie Russell, they're getting [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=100.44s)]
*  a fourth season. And speaking of four seasons, that series created by funny [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=104.7s)]
*  lady Tina Fey, they're getting a second swing too. And if you haven't seen it, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=110.2s)]
*  it is based on the 1981 film directed by and starring Alan Alda. It's one of my [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  favorite movies. Okay, I'm dating myself now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  Watch four seasons yet, but I am an avid Bridgerton viewer, so I'm kind of burning [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=123.16s)]
*  for those new seasons. But I got to do some binge watching here, I think, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=127.88s)]
*  because I don't think I'm caught up. The last time I saw it, I think the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=131.0s)]
*  characters were in very different places. Chloe, I don't know. But I also [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=134.24s)]
*  want to ask you about this moment back in March, right there where you are [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=137.68s)]
*  at 30 Rock Watch. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=141.88s)]

*  So Morgan Wallen's finally addressing his controversial SNL exit. The country [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=156.08s)]
*  music star says his decision to abruptly walk off the set at the end of the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  show during the credits was not because he was mad at anyone apparently, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=164.48s)]
*  but rather he was just quote ready to go home because he'd been there all week. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  Wallen was the musical guest on the March 29th episode with host Mikey [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  Madison. And as the clock struck one a.m., he skedaddled off the stage after [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  almost immediately after Madison signed off. Traditionally, the musical guest [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=180.92s)]
*  and post remain on stage to mingle with the cast. But then after his exit, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  the most memeable post posting a photo of a plane on Instagram writing Get me [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  to God's country. The phrase quickly went viral. Chloe, what was your favorite [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  of the of the Get me to God's country memes? There were some very Capitol Hill [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  centric ones that made it for the Hill Press Corral. I mean, I just have to say, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=203.16s)]

*  water cooler moments from this week. But listen, I gotta go because I gotta get [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  down to the courthouse to get inside for the Sean Diddy Combs trial. And that is [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  what's buzzing in the entertainment world. So you're all cut up for the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=232.84s)]
