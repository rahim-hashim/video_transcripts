# Center for American Progress CEO: GOP budget bill is an ‘economic train wreck’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0)
*  When you are arguing about illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits, 1.4 million, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=0.0s)]
*  1.4, they're not, they are not eligible. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  So they will be coming off. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=12.92s)]
*  So we, people are not, well, we all are going to die. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=15.44s)]
*  So for heaven sakes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=22.04s)]
*  For heaven sakes is right. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=27.32s)]
*  Republican Iowa Senator Joni Ernst caused quite a stir with those comments this week [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=28.64s)]
*  at a town hall where she was pressed about her support for Medicaid cuts in the House [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=33.28s)]
*  GOP budget bill. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=37.44s)]
*  After facing intense backlash, she doubled down with a sarcastic non-apology. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=39.2s)]
*  I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=45.68s)]
*  are all going to perish from this earth. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=56.56s)]
*  So I apologize. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=60.36s)]
*  And I'm really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=63.24s)]
*  fairy as well. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=68.64s)]
*  Joining us now, near a Tandon, former assistant to the president and domestic policy advisor [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  during the Biden administration and another Eugene, Jane Craig, chair of black Republicans [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=76.22s)]
*  for Harris. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  Because that is not really how Senator Ernst operates typically. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=83.24s)]
*  Like she does. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  She's not this sarcastic to the camera, walking through maybe a graveyard, making jokes like [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=92.64s)]
*  What the hell is going on? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=93.96s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=95.83999999999999s)]
*  I mean, the thing is this, it's this will run 2025. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  The Senator Ernst that we knew in 2014 or even like going back to 2010 when she first [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=99.56s)]
*  hit the scene is not the same or December or December is not the Senator Ernst we're [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=103.08s)]
*  dealing with in 2025. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=106.36s)]
*  We're dealing with a post Elon Musk that had an actual White House position. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=108.04s)]
*  We're dealing with a Donald Trump that's doing things that presidents typically do in Q4 [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=112.2s)]
*  of year four and Q2 of year one. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=115.84s)]
*  So that's the environment that we're in right now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=118.84s)]
*  Neera, Democrats actually pull better on health care. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  So this is a weak issue for Republicans. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=125.78s)]
*  How can they actually attack off of gaffes like this and what's actually happening with [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=128.6s)]
*  the budget? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  I thought this happened at an incredibly opportune time and it is a real issue. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=134.92s)]
*  The fact is that the Republican plan would mean 14 million people will lose health care [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=138.64s)]
*  and when people lose health care, people die. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=144.16s)]
*  So it is a completely legitimate issue. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=146.44s)]
*  The fact that this reconciliation bill, this budget bill, this big beautiful bill really [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=148.64s)]
*  means people, we are, it is Robin Hood in reverse. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  We are taking health care. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=157.78s)]
*  They are taking health care from working class people in order to pay for a tax cut for [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=159.52s)]
*  billionaires. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=165.24s)]
*  That is the fact of the matter and that's why I thought the fact that there was so much [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=166.24s)]
*  umbrage about this, people are so angry. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=170.68s)]
*  In Iowa, it's a uniting issue and as we head into Senate consideration of this legislation, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=173.28s)]
*  which is going to happen in the next week or two, the fact that Joni Ernst made this [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=181.48s)]
*  huge colossal mistake is really crucial because it illustrates the essential problem, which [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=185.4s)]
*  is senators are used to, are actually supposed to save your life, not do things to help kill [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=191.16s)]
*  people. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=196.24s)]
*  Well on the reconciliation bill, you might not be surprised to know that the Speaker [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=197.24s)]
*  of the House would disagree with your characterization of the reconciliation bill. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=200.96s)]
*  Here's what he had to say just moments ago on Meet the Press. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  And Mr. Speaker, a number of Senate Republicans share Elon Musk's concerns that it will add [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=210.0s)]
*  to the debt and deficit. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=215.88s)]
*  So how do you convince your Republican Senate colleagues to get on board and support this [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=217.12s)]
*  bill? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=222.6s)]
*  Well, I convinced my friends and colleagues by use of the facts. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=223.6s)]
*  I sent a long text message to my good friend Elon Musk after he made those comments the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  other day to explain this is not a spending bill. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=233.72s)]
*  This is a reconciliation package. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=237.14s)]
*  It is reconciling a budget. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=239.24s)]
*  So there is some additional spending, as you noted earlier at the opening, for national [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=241.28s)]
*  security, for historic investments in border security, the largest in generations. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=246.12s)]
*  Who wants to take it? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=255.88s)]
*  Because all I know is this is a spending bill. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=256.88s)]
*  It's this 100% spending bill. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=259.88s)]
*  And the thing is this, you know, one more time why Elon should not have been in government, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=261.44s)]
*  he doesn't even understand that this is still a mandatory spending, not a discretionary [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  about is, hey, is Tesla going to turn a profit if they lose their tax credits for EVs? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=268.32s)]
*  But the thing is this, Republicans, they're drunk on spending. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=275.12s)]
*  Every year and year out, they say Democrats are going to blow up the budget, Democrats [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=278.84s)]
*  are going to... [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=281.32s)]
*  But we have a united Republican government and spending is going up. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=282.32s)]
*  It's not an actual cut in spending. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=284.88s)]
*  This is an actual increase in spending. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=286.12s)]
*  It's really de-blowing up of the budget, de-blowing up the deficit, de-blowing up of the national [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=287.44s)]
*  debt. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=291.48s)]
*  I just want to add, you know, what's really crucial about this bill to remember for Republicans [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=292.48s)]
*  is that it is adding trillions of dollars to the debt and deficit at a time where the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=297.56s)]
*  bond market, the economy is in a precarious position. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=303.64000000000004s)]
*  And you're seeing Republican voices make the point. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=306.6s)]
*  You know, Jamie Dimon, not a liberal Democrat, is basically saying the bond market could [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=310.12s)]
*  crack. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  He said the threat is in the House, basically. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  Yes, essentially. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  What this means is this bill, which will, again, add trillions of dollars to the debt [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=320.92s)]
*  and deficit while cutting almost a trillion dollars from Medicaid in order to pay for [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=326.6s)]
*  trillion upon trillion upon trillions of dollars of tax cuts that no one is demanding except [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=333.6s)]
*  the billionaires, that this is an economic train wreck. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=339.76s)]
*  And Republicans who have lectured Democrats on fiscal responsibility are throwing it all [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=345.64s)]
*  out the window for these tax cuts. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  Remember, tax cuts are spending. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=351.08s)]
*  They have to be paid. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  And these are not new tax cuts. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  They just extend the tax cuts so people aren't going to actually feel any kind of new benefit. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=355.24s)]
*  Right. You're not going to have, you know, someone who was working three jobs already [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=359.6s)]
*  that's going to feel like, oh, you know, these tax cuts are great. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  This is better for me. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=365.72s)]
*  And the thing is this, right, James Carver was on before us and the infamous quote, it's [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=366.72s)]
*  all about the economy, stupid. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  You cannot have a healthy economy if you have unhealthy people. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=372.0s)]
*  And when you have the Republicans directly down on Capitol Hill cutting Medicare and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=374.72s)]
*  Medicaid, you know, from seniors, from vulnerable communities, people that are literally working [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=378.92s)]
*  class people, if these people get sick, guess what? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=383.16s)]
*  They can't work. They can't take care of their children. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  And that just hurts our economy across the board. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=387.48s)]
*  And I would just add one thing, which is, you know, what Trump is doing, what the Republicans [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  are doing, you know, let's just remember that people who are going to lose health care, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=394.52000000000004s)]
*  just to your point, but also the people who are paying these tariffs, the people who's [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=399.6s)]
*  going to pay a higher credit card bill because interest rates are going up, are working class [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=404.28000000000003s)]
*  people, the very people these people claim to speak for. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=408.56s)]
*  They are bearing the burden of all of this. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=412.32s)]
*  And that's why I think it's really important for Democrats to hold their chest up high as [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=414.68s)]
*  they fight this legislation. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=418.64s)]
*  You know, there are some government cuts I can get behind, certainly. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=420.12s)]
*  But I tend to be more strong government. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=424.16s)]
*  But things like the NOAA, the National Weather Organization that overseas and lets us know [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=427.88s)]
*  when we're in trouble, things like FEMA, things like the FAA. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=435.72s)]
*  What are we funding? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=439.76s)]
*  We're funding these tax cuts, yet we aren't taking care of the most base needs to duck [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=441.24s)]
*  and cover. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=447.44s)]
*  This is the true legacy of Elon Musk, right? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=449.64s)]
*  Because, look, I think a lot of people could have said, hey, we could reform the government. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=452.72s)]
*  The places where he's cutting are kind of the basic services that we need. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=456.64s)]
*  Like when you can't rely on airplanes coming out of an airport because the air traffic [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=461.40000000000003s)]
*  controllers have been and their support has been cut, when the weather service has lost [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=467.88s)]
*  hundreds of people, these are these are elements that help our economy grow. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=473.76s)]
*  You know, it's not it's these are basic services for people. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=479.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, I don't think it's like extravagant to be able to rely on the air traffic control [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=481.96000000000004s)]
*  system. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=486.24s)]
*  Park services this summer. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=486.72s)]
*  But so when these basic services just aren't there and they've started to hit in certain [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  pockets, but not everywhere, is that something? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=493.56s)]
*  Is that the moment Democrats capitalize on? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=496.72s)]
*  The issue is this, right, that there's actually been real harm done. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=498.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I love that you brought up NOAA and FEMA, right? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=501.32s)]
*  We're dealing with a situation right now in St. Louis where and across the Midwest where [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=503.92s)]
*  tornadoes hit. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  That's something that NOAA would have caught and FEMA would have responded to. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=509.08s)]
*  And in a situation where, you know, people should be opting up and coming together among [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=512.64s)]
*  our agencies to take care of our American citizens, our fellow American citizens, largely [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=518.36s)]
*  also black and brown citizens in these places, our federal government is opting out and [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=522.52s)]
*  it's literally harm is already being done before we even get into another budget that's [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=526.76s)]
*  going to further cut these agencies. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=530.72s)]
*  Or North Carolina, where the administration literally just said they weren't approving [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=531.84s)]
*  additional dollars for North Carolina. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=537.6s)]
*  Naira, one of the things that we all know is that this attention economy where to [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=539.36s)]
*  break through, you have to do a lot, right? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=544.52s)]
*  And so and to get people to pay attention to something for a long period of time, you [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=546.2s)]
*  have to do a lot. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=549.76s)]
*  It is June 1. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=550.88s)]
*  How do Democrats make sure that the effects of these, what we're going, what they're [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=553.08s)]
*  feeling right now, they actually make Republicans pay for in November? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=557.92s)]
*  How do you guys do that? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=561.12s)]
*  So I think that we have to focus like a laser beam on actual harms to people and really [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=561.76s)]
*  try to tell the stories at the local level. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=567.04s)]
*  And I applaud Democrats for going into Republican districts. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=569.48s)]
*  We really saw our last couple of recesses. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=573.0s)]
*  Democrats would use stories of people who are harmed by Medicaid from a Republican district, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=575.4s)]
*  go into the Republican district and really make clear. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=580.76s)]
*  And what's amazing about those those town halls is you'll have Eric Swalwell go into a [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=583.3199999999999s)]
*  Republican district and 600, 800, a thousand people are coming out from that district. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=587.56s)]
*  The point is, you know, we have to remember these things are not popular. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=594.6s)]
*  In fact, Donald Trump is not popular. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=598.0s)]
*  He's the least popular president. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=600.28s)]
*  And it's important for us to remember that and go into like, don't be shy. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=601.88s)]
*  Don't be scared. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=607.12s)]
*  Don't be a deer in headlights. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=608.12s)]
*  Go into Republican districts and act like this is the people who are bearing the burden [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=609.5600000000001s)]
*  of this are working class people. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=614.64s)]
*  Neera, since we have you at the table and you worked in the most recent administration, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=616.2s)]

*  Just quit your job. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqaamSEG1Z0&t=674.56s)]
