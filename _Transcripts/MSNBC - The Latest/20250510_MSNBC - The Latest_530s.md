*  federal probe into allegation of housing fraud is quote baseless and discredited. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=11.72s)]
*  In February last year Trump was ordered to pay more than 450 million dollars in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=16.88s)]
*  penalties from a lawsuit brought by James's office that accused him of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=21.32s)]
*  inflating his net worth to secure financial benefits. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=25.0s)]
*  This is nothing more than an extension of his revenge his retribution and he [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=28.48s)]
*  finally got up to the J's and so I stand prepared to respond to these [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=33.68s)]
*  baseless attacks with facts and we look forward obviously to further discussions [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=38.64s)]
*  with the Department of Justice I have been someone who has been targeted but I [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=45.56s)]
*  am not fearful I am fearless and I will continue to walk into the office of the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=50.8s)]
*  New York State Attorney General and again protect the residents and protect [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=56.0s)]
*  them from any harms coming from the federal government. Back again we've got [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=62.8s)]
*  Michael Hardaway and Brendan Buck. Michael you know you heard those fighting [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=67.32s)]
*  words there from James but in announcing this investigation into whether or not [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=70.6s)]
*  she falsified paperwork for property she owns in Virginia and New York the US [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=74.48s)]
*  Attorney said James quote unethically ran around the state campaigning on [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  getting Donald Trump. The merits of what James being accused of aside for the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=83.48s)]
*  moment what is your takeaway when prosecutors are explicitly saying there [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=88.48s)]
*  is a political component to the investigation into her? Well it's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=92.04s)]
*  shocking she's being attacked and persecuted for doing her job which is [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=96.44s)]
*  prosecuting someone who committed a crime like Donald Trump did. I mean this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=100.72s)]
*  doesn't happen in a real democracy the idea that Donald Trump has weaponized [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  the entire federal government against all of his enemies and opponents from [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  the law firms that represented his political opponents to the federal [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=112.44s)]
*  officials that have prosecuted him for his spreadsheet of crimes that he's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  committed. I mean this is shocking and we're only five months in. My real [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=120.38s)]
*  question is where does this go? I mean we've got three and a half years of this [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=124.08s)]
*  guy who seems to have no regard for the Constitution or the rule of law how far [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=128.2s)]
*  does this go? But Brendan Trump campaigned on the promise of that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=133.68s)]
*  retribution against his perceived enemies so should anyone be surprised and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=138.24s)]
*  what is your take on this investigation? I mean he did but he also said that he [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=142.28s)]
*  wasn't going to use DOJ in the way that he says it was used against him and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  obviously we can't take that very seriously. He's already put out [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=150.88s)]
*  executive memorandums, EOs by the president saying going after people like [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=159.04s)]
*  Miles Taylor and Chris Kreb. He's very out in the open going after people he [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=163.76s)]
*  perceived to be going after him previously. Certainly this feels like [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=169.16s)]
*  retribution. It feels pretty small sort of ticky-tacky stuff that they're going [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=172.64s)]
*  after her on but also feels a bit like intimidation to people who may be [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=176.48s)]
*  interested in coming after him in the future. We know that he's going after [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=181.22s)]
*  law firms trying to discourage any law firms from taking any cases that may [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=184.96s)]
*  hurt him so they're covered on all their bases just to make sure that nobody's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=188.44s)]
*  holding Donald Trump accountable in any way that they can. And look that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=191.56s)]
*  intimidation has been surprisingly effective in some venues. Brendan I also [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=195.24s)]
*  want to ask you you've got a new New York Times op-ed and in it you warn that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=199.0s)]
*  Trump's quote one big beautiful bill the details of which Republicans are [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  scrambling to work out could actually be a trap for the GOC GOP if they're [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  trying to offset the damage of President Trump's tariffs. So the heart of this [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=211.52s)]
*  bill is extending this 2017 law that reduces personal income tax. Can you tell [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=215.32000000000002s)]
*  us why you think it could be foolish for Republicans to believe that this package [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  is going to blunt the economic impact of those tariffs? Yeah well I'll start by [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=224.4s)]
*  saying I'm biased. I helped pass the 2017 tax law when I was working for Paul [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  Ryan. I think it was a good law and I think Congress should extend it. What I'm [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=233.84s)]
*  concerned about for Republicans is that they should not expect any voters to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  give them a big thank you for doing so. This is just keeping tax rates where [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=242.4s)]
*  they currently are. Look we actually cut people's taxes in 2017 and in 2018 and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  nobody noticed and we and we've lost the House that year. I don't think [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=253.36s)]
*  they're gonna get people are gonna give see a lot of bump in their in their pay [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=258.04s)]
*  or take-home pay as a result of this but then when you add in the fact that the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=262.2s)]
*  president is adding these tariffs adding to the cost of living it's gonna [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=266.92s)]
*  squander any economic benefit from this tax law and I think that the trap here [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=271.92s)]
*  is Republican leaders know this they know the tariffs are bad news but they [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=276.04s)]
*  are they cannot bring themselves to criticize him or try to do anything [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=280.26000000000005s)]
*  about that because they need Donald Trump to help pass that tax bill because [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=283.70000000000005s)]
*  there's gonna be a lot of people who aren't gonna want to vote for it and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=288.3s)]
*  they're gonna need his political muscle to do it so as long as they're looking [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=290.46000000000004s)]
*  the other way while tariffs keep raining down the economic situation is [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  gonna be worse and they aren't gonna really get any relief for passing this [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=298.22s)]
*  tax bill again because it's just keeping people's taxes where they already are [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=301.1s)]
*  but Michael on that note when it comes to this budget bill you've now got [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=304.02000000000004s)]
*  speaker Johnson he appears to be backing off some of the most aggressive [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=307.78s)]
*  cuts to Medicare but you know Republican lawmakers and competitive districts are [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=311.7s)]
*  pushing back against slashing Medicaid you know that third rail of politics [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=316.02s)]
*  over fear it it's gonna cost them votes could Democrats use this potentially [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=320.41999999999996s)]
*  getting Republicans on the record saying they're willing to cut these [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=325.65999999999997s)]
*  entitlement programs to help them potentially overtake the House next year [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=328.35999999999996s)]
*  yeah they can and they should look Republicans for whatever reason seem to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=332.41999999999996s)]
*  be committed to committing political suicide Medicare I'm sorry Medicaid is [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=337.06s)]
*  one of the most popular things in America it's far more popular than even [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=342.98s)]
*  ice cream you've got 97% of Americans who say that Medicaid is critical to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=347.38s)]
*  people in their community only 90% of Americans like ice cream and so I say [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=352.9s)]
*  all that to say if Democrats are smart which they are which leader Jeffries is [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=357.7s)]
*  leading this effort to drive awareness around the country around the idea that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=362.44s)]
*  you can't touch Medicaid that people need Medicaid in a political climate and [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=366.82s)]
*  an economic climate where everything is already unaffordable and that's without [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=371.62s)]
*  the $4,000 and additional taxes people will pay because of Trump's tariffs and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=376.34s)]
*  so if Republicans hope to avoid a blue wave in next year's midterms they have [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=381.58s)]
*  to figure out some way to back away from this friend and Americans opinion of [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=387.42s)]
*  ice cream aside you know to complicate matters further it's not really clear [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=391.82s)]
*  what exactly president Trump wants in this bill we've got the social media [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=395.62s)]
*  post where Trump said Republicans should probably not boost taxes on the nation's [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=398.98s)]
*  wealthiest people but in the same post he also said but I'm okay if they do [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=403.42s)]
*  this was after he reached out to speaker Mike Johnson about adding a tax hike on [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=407.7s)]
*  the highest earners something GOP lawmakers told me as early as this week [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=412.86s)]
*  that that's a non-starter with them what do you make of these deliberations well [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=416.86s)]
*  I think Donald Trump understands the politics of this bill admittedly in 2017 [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=421.46s)]
*  2018 we got beat up for I think unfairly calling the the tax law of tax cuts for [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=426.18s)]
*  the rich and he wants to take that criticism away problem is that we have [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=430.82s)]
*  40 years of Republican orthodoxy which is you never raise taxes and so we got [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=435.5s)]
*  some pretty fierce pushback from from members of the Republican conference in [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=439.97999999999996s)]
*  Congress so I don't think it's gonna happen but in some ways it is an [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=444.02s)]
*  admission that this is probably too rich for for the upper income and I'm sure [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=447.5s)]
*  Democrats are gonna make plenty of hay with that this is a situation where this [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=452.06s)]
*  is the biggest thing that Donald Trump has legislatively and he's basically been [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=455.78s)]
*  ignoring it his first hundred days and so just now he seems to have woken up [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=459.26s)]
*  into some of the details and he's meddling in it and making things harder [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=462.58s)]
*  it's not surprising that's what he did before but I'm sure Republican leaders [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=465.78s)]
*  don't appreciate him piping in with with random ideas that they have no interest [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=469.54s)]
*  in including and Michael quickly before I let you go if Republicans do manage to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=473.54s)]
*  levy attacks on high-income earners does that help or hurt Democrats well I don't [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=478.22s)]
*  think they will but it helps Democrats in the context of Republicans have [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=483.82s)]
*  come in and done nothing they promise to do in terms of driving down prices in [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=488.3s)]
*  terms of making America more affordable it would just be another failure of them [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=492.46000000000004s)]
*  to do anything surrounding any of those things but I don't think that they're [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=496.78000000000003s)]
*  going to raise taxes on their donors who support them and who drive their [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=501.1s)]
*  agenda all right Michael Hardaway Brennan Buck thank you both [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnRnQaUvgY&t=505.66s)]
