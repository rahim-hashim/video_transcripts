# 'So far-fetched, so outlandish, so brazen': Outrage over Trump's proposal to 'take over' Gaza
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw)
*  You have a really great take on this today. Among the things you write is this. When it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=0.0s)]
*  came to Gaza, Mr. Trump's thinking on Tuesday was so far outside the box that it was not [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=4.48s)]
*  clear he even knew there was a box. Provocative, intriguing, outlandish, outrageous, and not [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=9.64s)]
*  at all presidential. You know, as Kelly just said, do we know if this is real, if it's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=15.88s)]
*  simply provocative, maybe another part of his strategy to flood the zone? So we're talking [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=21.0s)]
*  about this and not about Elon Musk or mass deportations or shutting down the Department [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=26.34s)]
*  of Education. What do you think? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=31.58s)]
*  Well, on the one hand, it seems hard to take serious because it seems so far-fetched, so [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=34.14s)]
*  outlandish, so brazen, and so antithetical to anything that any U.S. president would [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=37.82s)]
*  ever conceive of, certainly in the modern era. On the other hand, you know, as Kelly [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=43.3s)]
*  noted, he was reading from notes. He told her, this is not something he had raised lately. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=49.06s)]
*  There's not like an actual plan. Nobody has done any actual work to document what this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=55.3s)]
*  would require, what kind of logistics might be involved or cost might be involved. But [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=59.66s)]
*  it's a little bit more than just him talking off the top of his head. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=65.1s)]
*  And he may not mean it seriously in the sense that we will ever pursue this. It's hard to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=69.1s)]
*  see how that would ever happen. Remember, he ran for office in 2016, decrying the idea [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=72.74000000000001s)]
*  of nation-building in the Middle East. Now he's proposed perhaps the most expansive idea [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=77.98s)]
*  of nation-building in the Middle East, certainly since the Iraq War two decades ago. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=83.62s)]
*  It may be that he loves getting people riled up and maybe that he likes to throw, you know, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=88.46s)]
*  stink bombs in the middle of the conversation because it doesn't seem possible they could do [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=97.06s)]
*  this. And yet he did say he's taking it seriously and he's got everybody else talking about [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=101.34s)]
*  it. And it is fair to say that Gaza is a demolition site. He used that phrase. More than half [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=105.02s)]
*  the buildings have been destroyed. It's hard to see how people can live there without some sort [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=110.42s)]
*  of massive reconstruction project. Nobody else come up with a better idea. But so far, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=115.06s)]
*  obviously, this is a non-starter from the point of view of, you know, most people in the region [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=119.7s)]
*  and certainly most people in Washington. Well, the other thing is, Peter, and you mentioned this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=125.06s)]
*  as well, is that it seemed to be an idea that grew by the hour as the day went on. I mean, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=129.22s)]
*  tell us more about that and what some people would consider the audacity to propose it without [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=134.82s)]
*  any details or seemingly any real idea of what would be involved. Yeah, it did grow through the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=140.18s)]
*  day. At the beginning of the day, his aides were telling reporters, he asked, look, it's going to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=146.34s)]
*  take 15 years to rebuild Gaza, something a lot of people would agree with. And we had to figure out [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=150.18s)]
*  how to work with partners in the region to help people in the Palestinians living there to find [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  someplace to live during that. A lot of people might agree with that, at least on the face. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=160.02s)]
*  By the time he met with reporters for an executive order signing, he's saying, you know, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=164.5s)]
*  there's no alternative for the Palestinians but to leave Gaza, which is a more provocative way [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=169.86s)]
*  of saying it. Within an hour or so, he's hosting Netanyahu, and he goes even further still, saying [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=174.26s)]
*  that, you know, that he wants all Palestinians to leave and that they won't tell him no, which [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=179.22s)]
*  sounds kind of menacing, of course. And it was by the evening when Kelly O'Donnell is shown there [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=184.1s)]
*  at that press conference in the East Room that he finally goes even further by saying the United [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=188.58s)]
*  States would take ownership of Gaza, which of course really, I think, made head spin all over [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=193.94s)]
*  the region. So Richard Engel, what's been the reaction to this overseas? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=200.98s)]
*  Well, the reaction in the Middle East has been shock. It has been horror. People have described [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=207.94s)]
*  it as ethnic cleansing. They described it as profoundly destabilizing to the entire Middle East [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=213.94s)]
*  since this event happened. And we're working with a time difference here. So since this event [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=221.62s)]
*  happened last night in the U.S., I've been getting phone calls, texts pretty much through the night [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=226.66s)]
*  with people trying to figure out exactly the subject that you're trying to figure out. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=233.86s)]
*  Is he really serious? It seems so detached from reality, and it would be so brutal to carry out. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=237.78s)]
*  You have a situation where Gaza is more or less destroyed right now. Many of the homes, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  the buildings have been damaged, and the infrastructure has been torn up. So people [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=251.22s)]
*  are now in the midst of going back to northern Gaza in particular. A lot of Gazans, as you remember, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=256.1s)]
*  were forced down into the south, which was less damaged, although quite significantly as well, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=262.66s)]
*  and they're going back up to the north and seeing all of this rubble. So they're already going [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=268.66s)]
*  through this trauma right now of having been under attack, having been crammed down into southern [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=273.62s)]
*  Gaza. Now they're making the journey often on foot to the north, and then they suddenly hear [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=279.3s)]
*  from President Trump, oh, by the way, you're all going to have to leave again. You're all going to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=285.14s)]
*  have to go to countries where you don't want to go, countries that don't want to have you, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=289.94s)]
*  and the U.S. is going to be responsible for doing this. The U.S. is going to take possession somehow [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=294.74s)]
*  of that land and build some sort of riviera. And Palestinians are quite convinced this riviera [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=300.58000000000004s)]
*  does not apply to them, that they will be expelled and that there could be, if this [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=306.82s)]
*  scenario ever played out, some sort of development projects, but that they would not be the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=312.09999999999997s)]
*  beneficiaries here. So I'm hearing a lot of outrage and a lot of questions about how serious [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  he is, because when you think about the practicalities, how would this work? It just seems so implausible [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=323.14s)]
*  because President Trump would have to come up with some sort of plan. They would have to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=328.82s)]
*  get Palestinians to agree to leave, and some probably would leave, no doubt. There's a lot [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=334.18s)]
*  of destruction there. People are given other alternatives. Maybe they would go. But then, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=339.86s)]
*  what about the people? And there are many, and we spoke to some of them today, who say they don't [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=343.62s)]
*  want to leave because leaving isn't just leaving their home. It's leaving the homeland. It's [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=347.94s)]
*  abandoning the idea that there will ever be a Palestinian state because you can't have a [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=352.98s)]
*  Palestinian state without any people. So if the Palestinians from Gaza, roughly two million of them, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=357.3s)]
*  were suddenly sent to Jordan or Egypt and or other countries in the region, that would be [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=363.46s)]
*  really the end of the Palestinian state. And the only people in the Middle East who are celebrating [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=370.73999999999995s)]
*  this today are the hardline Israeli settlers who all along thought this was a great opportunity, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=375.85999999999996s)]
*  this post-October 7th moment, to reoccupy Gaza and to restore Jewish settlements to the area. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=382.5s)]
*  So it has sent people into something of a tailspin in the region as they're trying to figure out, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=392.58s)]
*  is he really going to do this? Is he really serious about this? And I guess we'll find out [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=400.02s)]
*  more in the days ahead if this was just some sort of thought balloon that he had, clearly with the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=405.21999999999997s)]
*  encouragement of some Israelis, or if this is really going to become policy. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=412.74s)]
*  So, Elif, let's assume the president is serious. Talk to me about what would be involved here on [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=418.5s)]
*  the U.S. side, logistically, financially, because Peter points this out in his article. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=422.82s)]
*  This would be the biggest U.S. commitment of strength and money in the Middle East in 20 years, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=428.18s)]
*  back to when you were in the Bush administration. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=433.46s)]
*  No, it would be another occupation just like in Iraq. And is that what the American public, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=436.74s)]
*  especially the Trump voters who do not want an interventionist foreign policy, is that what they [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=442.26s)]
*  voted for? I think that even Donald Trump's hold on his base is not that strong, where deploying [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=447.78s)]
*  American troops to occupy and seize Gaza, that might even be a bridge too far for those voters. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=453.61999999999995s)]
*  It is just an idea that logistically and financially, morally, is completely stupid. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=460.82s)]
*  And you have to admire that Donald Trump, for whatever reason he said this, let's hope that [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=470.02s)]
*  it's just a trial balloon to distract from Elon Musk absorbing all of his headlines. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=474.98s)]
*  He is shameless and he doesn't mind putting out such a preposterous, toxic idea when it is just [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=480.66s)]
*  completely not feasible in terms of our national debt and in terms of the American public and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=487.62s)]
*  their tolerance for another war. Well, Peter, let's talk about the politics of this, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=494.58000000000004s)]
*  because it would seem to be, as just pointed out, the opposite of everything Trump has [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=499.54s)]
*  campaigned on or said he believed in for a long time, extricating the U.S. from the Middle East, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=504.74s)]
*  saving money. And yet while Democrats seem stunned, some Republicans seem to at least be [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=509.94s)]
*  trying to get on board. Take a listen. This is an extraordinarily dangerous [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=515.78s)]
*  approach for the president to take and not consistent with American values. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=522.74s)]
*  Is it different? And is he thinking outside the box? Absolutely. Does that mean that other [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=528.02s)]
*  people are going to start coming up with ideas about how we can find a peaceful solution? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=534.1s)]
*  I hope so. I'm not sure whether this was off the cuff or a strategy, but in either case, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=538.1s)]
*  I think it actually sets back the cause of peace in that region. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=545.62s)]
*  We're trying to get the details of it, but I think this is a good development. We have to [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=550.8199999999999s)]
*  back Israel 100 percent, and so whatever form that takes, we're interested in having that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=555.14s)]
*  discussion. But it was a surprising development, but I think it's one that we'll applaud. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=560.42s)]
*  I have to say that's something that we hear often, Peter, from Republicans. We'll have to [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=566.34s)]
*  get the details of it. But how do you see this playing out politically? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=570.34s)]
*  Well, you know, I mean, look, there are some Republicans who are questioning it. Senator [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=575.3s)]
*  Rand Paul, who's always been an anti-interventionist, has tweeted out that the United States has no [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=579.38s)]
*  business contemplating another occupation in the Middle East. And actually, to a least point about [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=584.18s)]
*  Iraq and my own mention of that in the story, I would add that there is even a difference there. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=589.8599999999999s)]
*  Even with Iraq, the United States' goal was to help them build a democracy of their own, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=594.0999999999999s)]
*  reconstruct it, and then get out, to leave the country to them. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=599.06s)]
*  What Trump is talking about here, by the way, is owning it at lock, stock and barrel for the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=601.78s)]
*  United States and not allowing the Palestinians to come back. They're not going in there to [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47BS2wITXuw&t=606.0999999999999s)]
