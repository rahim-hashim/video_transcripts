# Treated 'like ANIMALS': Reported inhumane conditions inside Trump's 'Alligator Alcatraz'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY)
*  Meantime, as we return to a new challenge against that controversial migrant detention [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=0.0s)]
*  facility in Florida, the one that's been dubbed Alligator Alcatraz, five Democratic Florida [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=4.68s)]
*  lawmakers have filed a lawsuit against Governor Ron DeSantis and the Florida Department of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=9.48s)]
*  Emergency Management, the executive director of that, after they were denied access to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=13.64s)]
*  the center. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=18.8s)]
*  A DeSantis representative said, quote, the state is looking forward to quickly dispensing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=19.8s)]
*  with this dumb lawsuit. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=23.76s)]
*  Still joining us now, Florida State Senator Chevron Jones. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=26.2s)]
*  Chev, good to have you here on the show. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=29.36s)]
*  You are one of those five lawmakers suing your state. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=31.72s)]
*  So why file this suit? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=35.28s)]
*  And why is it important that you get access to the facility? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=37.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Alex. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=41.12s)]
*  Listen, we're not asking for access. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=42.12s)]
*  We're entitled to it because it's the law. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=44.28s)]
*  My colleagues and I were denied access on July 3rd. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=46.76s)]
*  In the Constitution, it gives us the legal authority to be able to go into any state [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=50.36s)]
*  run or any county run facility. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  So, yes, we found a writ of court warrant against Governor DeSantis and the Department [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=57.68s)]
*  of Emergency Management because of them denying us entry into the facility. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=63.48s)]
*  OK, so along with this suit, you do plan to attend a tour of the facility tomorrow. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm curious what you're looking for specifically, what you expect to see. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=74.44s)]
*  And do you think the reason you were denied July 3rd was to offer the facility more time [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  to, you know, clean things up, make things a bit more presentable for the inspection [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=85.88s)]
*  that you will conduct? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=90.28s)]
*  Well, Alex, unfortunately, the unfortunate part about that is that we don't want a sanitized [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=92.44s)]
*  tour. We were going on a tour that was unannounced for the very reason to be able to look at [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  what and how the facility and whether it was up to par for those individuals. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=103.63999999999999s)]
*  And the fact that they denied us of that is unfortunate. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=108.6s)]
*  Now, when we get there on Saturday, we're not going to be able to talk to any of the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=112.04s)]
*  detainees there. We know that they have cleaned up. But I will tell you, Alex, that we have [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=115.96s)]
*  spoken with family members who have shared that their family members have been denied [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=120.36s)]
*  access to their medication. We have been shared by family members that their family member is [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=125.32s)]
*  making it clear that they have not been fed or they've been denied a shower. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=131.88s)]
*  So, these inhumane treatments that's happening is par for the course of this administration [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=135.8s)]
*  and the Trump administration. And I heard Stephen Miller say last week on Fox News when [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=140.28s)]
*  it comes to inhumane treatment and that it wasn't happening. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=145.24s)]
*  Well, I have a group of text messages from many people who are family members who are there [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=147.72s)]
*  to prove Stephen Miller wrong and what they're doing to push back on the Trump administration [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=152.52s)]
*  and how they are handling this, in which they are calling immigration policy. And it's not [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=156.68s)]
*  what they are doing right now. They are doing this to these individuals because they are [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=160.84s)]
*  politically vulnerable and it's politically expedient for them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=164.76s)]
*  Yeah, things like lack of water, issues of electricity, as you're saying, being prevented [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=168.2s)]
*  from getting medication, copious amounts of mosquitoes. That said, the president has [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  described this place as not a nice place, but he has said that it could serve as a blueprint of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  sorts for other immigration facilities nationwide down the road. What is your reaction to that? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, listen, the president has made it clear and is based off of the name of this facility, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=189.16s)]
*  Alligator Alcatraz, and their idea that they are trying to go after the worst of the worst. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  What I will tell you is that the worst of the worst are not the individuals that's in there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=199.96s)]
*  The worst of the worst is not the individual. That's what the talking points that they're [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=204.36s)]
*  giving. I'll tell you who's in there. The individuals who are in this facility, Alex, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  are individuals who are on TPS, individuals who are in the middle of a process. That is who are [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=211.56s)]
*  in there right now. And it's unfortunate that the Trump administration, that this is their guise of [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  what immigration policy looked like. When I truly believe there is a more humane way that we can do [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=222.52s)]
*  this, here's what I will say, because I was asked the question, do you believe that there is something [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=227.96s)]
*  about this facility that you can get on board with? I could. If they were genuinely saying that they [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=232.36s)]
*  were going after criminals, because I believe me or anybody else would not want criminals roaming [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=237.4s)]
*  our state or our country, but that's not what they're doing. They are taking advantage and they are [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  treating individuals like animals. But in our actuality, these are actual human beings who [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  are here in this state legally waiting for the federal government to give them their access [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=252.28s)]
*  into this country. I think you said it right there. Florida State Senator, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=257.08s)]
*  Chev Jones. Thank you so much, Chev. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHX7cAes1bY&t=261.64s)]
