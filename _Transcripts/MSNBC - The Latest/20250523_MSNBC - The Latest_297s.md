# 'Enough to make you crazy': Social Security chatbot talks in circles; DOGE further degrades service
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg)
*  Right now, if you have an issue with your Social Security and call the Social Security Administration to ask about it, this is who picks up. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=0.0s)]
*  How can I help you today? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=11.0s)]
*  Can I speak to an agent? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=14.0s)]
*  To better serve you, please briefly explain the reason for your call. How can I help you today? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=20.0s)]
*  I didn't get a check in April. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=26.0s)]
*  The 2025 cost of living adjustment or COLA for Social Security and Supplemental Security Income or SSI beneficiaries is 2.5%. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=30.0s)]
*  The standard Medicare Part B premium is $185 per month. If you're finished, feel free to hang up. Otherwise, how can I help you today? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=42.0s)]
*  That's enough to make you crazy. I mean, that was Social Security's new artificial intelligence chat bot. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=52.0s)]
*  It is not particularly intelligent, it seems. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=58.0s)]
*  So we could go a reporter from the Washington Post called the Social Security hotline, that's what you just heard, with the very basic issue. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=62.0s)]
*  She didn't get a check. She wanted to speak to an agent. This is something lots of people are experiencing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=69.0s)]
*  The reporter wanted to know how long it would take for the chat bot to help with that very simple issue. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=74.0s)]
*  I didn't get a check in April and I want to speak to an agent. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=80.0s)]
*  You can get Social Security retirement benefits and work at the same time. Say agent for additional assistance. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=84.0s)]
*  If you're finished, feel free to hang up. Otherwise, how can I help you today? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=94.0s)]
*  Agent. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=99.0s)]
*  For faster service, please say the reason for your call. How can I help you today? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=101.0s)]
*  I didn't get my April check and I want to speak to an agent. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=108.0s)]
*  The 2025 cost of living adjustment or COLA. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=111.0s)]
*  I mean, that is maddening. And not only does Social Security already use that AI chat bot for its national phone number, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=120.0s)]
*  it's planning to roll out that automated chat bot to all of its field offices by this summer. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=131.0s)]
*  Ever since Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency infiltrated the Social Security Administration, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=135.0s)]
*  the agency has gotten much, much worse. I mean, that's not the only thing, the AI chat bot. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=141.0s)]
*  The website keeps crashing. The wait times have skyrocketed. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=148.0s)]
*  For months now, all across the country, Social Security recipients are dealing with an unbelievable amount of chaos and confusion. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=151.0s)]
*  But rather than focusing on those ideas, Dozier has been firing workers by the thousands, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=158.0s)]
*  pushing thousands more to retire and devoting tons of resources to hunt for almost completely non-existent fraud. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=163.0s)]
*  Case in point, I mean, last week, the publication NextGov obtained internal Social Security documents showing how Dozier went looking for phone specific fraud [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=172.0s)]
*  and found almost none. I literally mean almost none. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=181.0s)]
*  To be exact, Dozier used a new anti-fraud tool on 110,000 claims made over the phone, 110,000, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=184.0s)]
*  and only found two that might potentially be fraudulent. Two. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=190.0s)]
*  But that anti-fraud tool slowed retirement claim processing by 25% across the board. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=196.0s)]
*  Great job, guys. Good job on that one. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=202.0s)]
*  Now, Social Security just got a new leader, a new commissioner of Social Security. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=207.0s)]
*  Frank Bazzignano was sworn into the role just a week and a half ago. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=211.0s)]
*  And I wish I could tell you that Commissioner Bazzignano was just the man for the job. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=215.0s)]
*  I wish I could tell you that he definitely knows what he is doing and will just turn this whole thing around. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=218.0s)]
*  But yesterday, ABC News obtained audio of Commissioner Bazzignano telling his staff about when he first got offered his new gig. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=224.0s)]
*  So take a listen to that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=231.0s)]
*  I got a phone call and it's about Social Security. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=233.0s)]
*  And I'm really, I'm really not, I swear I'm not looking for a job. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=237.0s)]
*  And I'm like, well, what am I going to do? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=242.0s)]
*  So I'm Googling Social Security. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=244.0s)]
*  You know, one of my great skills. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=247.0s)]
*  I'm one of the great Googlers on the East Coast. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=249.0s)]
*  I'm like, what the heck is the commissioner of Social Security? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=251.0s)]
*  What the heck is the commissioner of Social Security was his last question as he's telling the story of learning he was going to be. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=256.0s)]
*  Exactly that. You are now the commissioner of Social Security, sir. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=264.0s)]
*  You are it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=268.0s)]
*  And for all our sakes, I hope Google is giving you lots of good answers on how to fix your agency. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=269.0s)]
*  Since you're the Googler guy, I guess. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DakKe9A8tbg&t=274.0s)]
