# 'Trump will go after Elon's money next.' Michael Cohen predicts toxic Trump-Elon fallout
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao)
*  And just like that, Elon Musk has left Washington, D.C. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=0.0s)]
*  Or do you believe that he has left Washington, D.C.? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=5.2s)]
*  He has left in body, if not in spirit, and in phone calls. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=7.44s)]
*  He's got some bruises on him. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=10.48s)]
*  Literally. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=12.64s)]
*  Like, spiritual, emotional bruises, but also a big one on him. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  He is leaving D.C. with a black eye, literally and figuratively. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=16.48s)]
*  But a lot of questions about how much damage he's done, whether or not he is going to be [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=20.56s)]
*  leaving or just kind of like pulling into the shadows, or maybe he's actually had a [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=24.8s)]
*  falling out with Donald Trump as Michael Cohen, who's going to join us in a few minutes, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=28.56s)]
*  had previously suggested. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  So we'll see what happens, but not a good way to end. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=34.56s)]
*  I think the investors in Tesla may be quite excited to have him back, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=37.68s)]
*  given how much damage he's done to the brand. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=42.56s)]
*  Not that like the brand was doing so well before Doge. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=44.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=49.76s)]
*  And in fact, the FT had a story this week about how investors are demanding that he [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=50.08s)]
*  spend 40 hours a week. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=54.64s)]
*  Back to the nine to five. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=56.8s)]
*  Yeah, because no one wants to work anymore in this country, apparently, including the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  richest man in the world. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=63.28s)]
*  And, you know, he was all about the return to office mandate before. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=65.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=68.64s)]
*  But the Doge project technically lives on with or without him present in D.C. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=69.12s)]
*  Yeah, and as he said, and we'll get into this in a little bit, he said it's a way of life. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=74.4s)]
*  Like Buddhism. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=78.16s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=79.04s)]
*  I think people over on Capitol Hill who are passing the new big, beautiful budget [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  probably have a different way of life than what Elon Musk is proposing, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  seeing the numbers that are being floating around. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=86.96s)]
*  But it'll it'll be interesting to see how it plays out. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=88.72s)]
*  Well, we'll dig into that in a whole lot more. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  But we want to start this hour with a lot of developments. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  And we're going to get to this more with our next guest. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=97.36s)]
*  He's got plenty more to say about Trump and Musk and that bizarre press conference, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=98.96s)]
*  Michael Cohen, as I mentioned. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=103.28s)]
*  But that's not the only chaos that we saw from the White House this week. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=104.72s)]
*  Once again, Donald Trump's erratic tariff policies really sent the markets plunging [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  into chaos. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  No other way to say it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  Yesterday, Trump ranted on Truth Social about trade relations on China. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=115.52s)]
*  And he wrote this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=120.08s)]
*  The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  has totally violated its agreement with us. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  So much for being Mr. Nice Guy. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=128.48s)]
*  Now, that post came just days after Trump was mocked for his on-again, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=130.88s)]
*  off-again approach to tariffs. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=134.88s)]
*  Traders on Wall Street adopted a new nickname for the president's whiplash trade policies. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=136.88s)]
*  They're calling it TACO, and it is an acronym that stands for Trump Always Chickens Out. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  Needless to say, Trump didn't react well when he was asked about it in the White House. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=151.36s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=155.52s)]
*  Mr. President, Wall Street analysts have coined a new term called the TACO trade. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=157.68s)]
*  They're saying Trump always chickens out on your tariff threats, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  and that's why markets are higher this week. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  I kick out. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=167.52s)]
*  Chicken out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  Oh, then I chicken out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=170.08s)]
*  I've never heard that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=171.84s)]
*  You mean because I reduced China from 145 percent that I set, down to 100, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=172.72s)]
*  and then down to another number, and I said you have to open up your whole country? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=178.56s)]
*  And because I gave the European Union a 50 percent tax tariff? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=182.88s)]
*  We had a dead country. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=190.88s)]
*  We had a country people didn't think was going to survive, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=192.16s)]
*  and you ask a nasty question like that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=194.4s)]
*  It's called negotiation. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=197.76s)]
*  All right, joining us now is someone who knows Trump all too well, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=200.0s)]
*  Michael Cohen, former personal attorney to Donald Trump. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=203.12s)]
*  He's also the host of the Mia Culpa podcast and substack top rated host at The Real Michael Cohen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=205.84s)]
*  Michael, it's good to have you with us. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=211.68s)]
*  You know somebody. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=212.88s)]
*  You know Donald Trump better than others. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=214.88s)]
*  You certainly know his psychology better than most. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  What did you make of his reaction to that soundbite? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=219.84s)]
*  The fact that he is being called basically, I guess I don't want to say TACO Trump, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=221.68s)]
*  but TACO it is. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=226.0s)]
*  It's very delicious. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=227.2s)]
*  Nickname as humiliating. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  Knowing Trump, he'll probably try to coin that and make money off of it down the road. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=230.72s)]
*  I think it's the word chicken that really. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=234.08s)]
*  Yeah, you're 100 percent correct. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=236.08s)]
*  It's the word chicken because he doesn't want to be perceived as anything other than a superhero, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  Than a godlike figure. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  This is the whole problem. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=246.32000000000002s)]
*  The problem is we're looking at it the wrong way. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=247.84s)]
*  It's not getting to him. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it caught him off guard, and so he looks surprised, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=252.32000000000002s)]
*  but it's not getting to him the way Democrats think. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=255.52s)]
*  This isn't going to be the thing that changes the outcome of 2026. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=258.88s)]
*  And as Democrats, we have to stop. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  We're never going to beat the bully in the playground when it comes to name calling. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=266.16s)]
*  That Trump singularly owns. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=271.6s)]
*  What we have to do is we have to start to impress upon people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=274.08s)]
*  We need to fight this fight in a manner that the Democrats have never fought it before. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=278.48s)]
*  The old playbook that they have that Ken Martin has that was written by, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=284.4s)]
*  I don't know, somebody in Hillary Clinton's basement. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=288.23999999999995s)]
*  It's over. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=290.64s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  We need to start coming up with things like consumers pay tax tariffs or tariffs are taxes. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=293.2s)]
*  These three words, which is what Trump does, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  Build the wall, lock her up, mass deportation. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=303.12s)]
*  Now, it's always easy to remember three word slogans. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=306.0s)]
*  We need to do the same thing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=310.64s)]
*  That way, when you go to the big box store and then you see that the cost on something [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=311.92s)]
*  that you pay $10 for is now $21, you understand consumers pay tariffs or tariffs are taxes. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  We have to let people understand that things are not good. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=324.72s)]
*  While all of this is going on, if you read the New York Times article, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=330.56s)]
*  his favorability ratings are going up. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=334.64s)]
*  So that's why I don't believe that calling him taco Trump or whatever they're calling him [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=337.68s)]
*  is making any difference. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  So you don't think that calling him a chicken, mocking him, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  might bait him into doing something even more aggressively stupid? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  That's my concern here. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  More aggressively stupid? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  That's already been taking place? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=356.48s)]
*  Like that's on the tariffs. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=358.24s)]
*  He reduced the tariffs and maybe he'll jack them up again [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=360.24s)]
*  because he wants to show what a big strong man he is. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=363.36s)]
*  If in fact that they don't come to the table, which most analysts believe that they will not, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=365.68s)]
*  will he not jack the tariffs up again? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=371.36s)]
*  Simply because it's not about policy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=374.8s)]
*  For Trump, it's about power. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=378.24s)]
*  He wants everybody to come to him, bend the knee, kiss the ring, and then say, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=380.72s)]
*  Trump, you're right. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=387.44s)]
*  You're the most powerful man on the planet. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=388.96s)]
*  All hail King Donald. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=391.52s)]
*  What is it that we can do to get back in your good grace? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=393.36s)]
*  So is he purposely erratic and chaotic then? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=395.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=398.0s)]
*  He's always managed through chaos. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=398.32s)]
*  The Trump Organization, we operated through chaos. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  He also did the exact same thing at the Trump Organization that he's doing in the White House, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=403.76s)]
*  which is you pit one individual against another. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=408.8s)]
*  This is just nothing with Trump is ever new. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=412.32s)]
*  It's always a rehash of what was done before. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=415.2s)]
*  The one thing I was going to say though is, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=417.84000000000003s)]
*  this was not the Democrats calling him chicken. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=420.32s)]
*  This was the industry insider, the traders. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=422.8s)]
*  He's always had a thing, correct me if I'm wrong, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  he's always sought the approval of the powerful traders in the Wall Street [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=428.08s)]
*  and the business elites in this country. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=433.04s)]
*  He covets their attention. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=434.8s)]
*  He covets their respect, as you said. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=436.16s)]
*  So when this name came out, it wasn't coming out as a Democratic punchline. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=438.16s)]
*  Nobody's campaigning on Donald Trump being a chicken. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  It's the people who are living day to day on the trading floor who have to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=445.04s)]
*  guess which way they have to trade or strategize about how they have to trade [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=449.36s)]
*  are calling Donald Trump a chicken. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=453.6s)]
*  And a lot of them voted for him. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=455.44s)]
*  What's that? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=456.64s)]
*  And a lot of voted for him. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=457.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's why I'm saying to you, and just to push back on your point, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  and I don't disagree with you that Democrats need to come up with something better, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=461.04s)]
*  but this is coming from the industry and the Wall Street and the rich people [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=464.56s)]
*  that he wants to be a part of and they're telling him you're a chicken. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=467.76s)]
*  No, it's coming from the lower level analysts and those that are on Wall Street. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  It's not coming from the Jamie Dimons. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  It's not coming from the Steve Schwarzmans. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=477.44s)]
*  They're not calling him Taco Trump. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=480.64s)]
*  It's the young traders that came up with the nickname. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=482.8s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=486.48s)]
*  And that's the whole point I'm trying to make to the Democratic Party. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=487.92s)]
*  This is not the strategy that we need in order to ensure 2026. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=491.68s)]
*  I have to ask, who do you think punched Elon Musk in the eye? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=496.4s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of reports. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=500.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=502.32s)]
*  I mean, it would have been nice. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=502.88s)]
*  Do you believe it was X's son? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=503.92s)]
*  No. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=505.52s)]
*  You don't buy that? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=506.48s)]
*  You don't think he has a really mean left hook or something? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=510.0s)]
*  For all you know, maybe he threw a fire truck or something at him because Elon is irritating. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=510.48s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=518.24s)]
*  Well, dolls are harder to come by nowadays, so it may not be. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=519.76s)]
*  It's not that they're not harder to come by. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=522.64s)]
*  They're just, I don't know, two and a half times the expense because they're all manufactured in China. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=524.48s)]
*  But what do you make of the bromance coming to an end? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=529.36s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=533.36s)]
*  I mean, there's so many layers to this. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=533.6s)]
*  Let's just start on a personal level, right? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=535.36s)]
*  Whether or not Doge lives on, what that looks like, what lasting damage he has done. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=537.36s)]
*  Put that aside for a moment. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  We'll get into that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=542.72s)]
*  Give me your take on the way Donald Trump, and I would argue, used Elon Musk for his money over [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  the course of the last seven to eight months, helps him get elected, and then realizes he's [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=550.16s)]
*  been somewhat of a liability because of his quirkiness, the way he behaves, that he's now [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=555.04s)]
*  basically discarding him. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=559.28s)]
*  Wow, Eamon, you're like a psychic. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=560.72s)]
*  I've been saying this now forever. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=563.76s)]
*  Donald doesn't care about anyone or anything other than himself. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=565.92s)]
*  Look at what he did to me, for God's sakes. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=569.68s)]
*  Guy who was with him for a decade and a half, who literally would have taken a bullet for him, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=571.76s)]
*  but for him being the one pulling the trigger. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=576.56s)]
*  I mean, I said from the very start that this bromance was going to come to an end. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=579.12s)]
*  In fact, I was on a couple of the MSNBC shows, and I'm going to go one step even further again. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=584.4799999999999s)]
*  I'm going to say Trump will ultimately go after Elon's money next because it bothers him that he [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=590.3199999999999s)]
*  is the richest man in the world. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  Yes, he used him for his money. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  Now he's going to go and he's going to figure out how Elon, with his companies, took advantage [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=599.8399999999999s)]
*  of the United States of America. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=604.64s)]
*  They're going to turn around, use Doge to go, right? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=606.4s)]
*  Government efficiency, fraud, waste, and abuse. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=608.7199999999999s)]
*  How is it that he got $7,000 as a credit for every Tesla vehicle that was sold? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=611.28s)]
*  That's where his billions were made. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=616.9599999999999s)]
*  Why should the United States pay for electric vehicles? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=619.52s)]
*  Pay your own car if that's what you want. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=623.44s)]
*  So they're going to claw it back. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=625.2800000000001s)]
*  He's going to do to Elon Musk, my prediction, what Mohammed bin Salman did to the other members [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=626.96s)]
*  of the royal family. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=632.96s)]
*  So let me ask you a broader question because you can speak from experience on this. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=634.32s)]
*  Why is it that so many Trump allies mistakenly assume that the loyalty goes both ways? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=638.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, they don't. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=643.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, you did. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=644.96s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=645.84s)]
*  I always knew that loyalty with Trump, it's like First Avenue, goes one way, but I thought [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=646.8s)]
*  I would be different. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=651.92s)]
*  I wrote about it in my book, Disloyal. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=653.5999999999999s)]
*  Does it seem like Elon thinks he's different, though? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=655.04s)]
*  100%. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=657.04s)]
*  And so does Lutnick and so does Besant and so does Marco Rubio and so does even J.D. Vance. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=658.24s)]
*  They all think that they're different, that Donald is going to shine the light on them. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=664.7199999999999s)]
*  When push comes to shove, the perceived- [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=669.52s)]
*  Why does everybody have the same delusion? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=672.8s)]
*  I don't have the answer to that. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=675.52s)]
*  It's just he's a cult leader and we were all indoctrinated into the cult. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B9MliHIao&t=676.88s)]
