# ‘Looney tunes’: Pam Bondi ordered DOJ to ban paper straws, ex-DOJ lawyer says
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0)
*  But now we turn to President Trump's legal roller coaster. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=0.0s)]
*  He's coming off a rocky week of setbacks as the Supreme Court stopped some of his deportations [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=3.6s)]
*  under the Alien Enemies Act and appeared divided over how lower courts should handle his executive [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=8.56s)]
*  order banning birthright citizenship. But Donald Trump has an ace in his legal corner, Attorney [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  General Pam Bondi, who often seems to operate more like his personal attorney than the top [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=21.6s)]
*  law enforcement officer for the country. During her confirmation hearings, Bondi pledged to be [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=26.32s)]
*  independent and vowed that politics would not factor into her decisions. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=32.32s)]
*  No one will be prosecuted, investigated because they are a political opponent. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=37.52s)]
*  The partisanship, the weaponization will be gone. America will have one tier [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=42.8s)]
*  of justice for all. There will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=50.96s)]
*  I believe that the Justice Department must be independent and must act independently. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=56.0s)]
*  Woo, how things have changed since she was sworn in just over three months ago. Now, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=65.04s)]
*  the New York Times reports that Bondi, quote, sees her role as that of a surrogate, a faithful [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=70.0s)]
*  executor and high-volume messenger compelled to seed ground to, gosh, to empowered players in the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=76.96s)]
*  West Wing and in her own building who exercise significant authority that rivals her own, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=86.32s)]
*  according to interviews with 20 current and former officials. Perhaps that could also explain why, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=91.6s)]
*  as the Times points out, she has made at least three dozen near-exclusive appearances on Fox [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=96.96s)]
*  News shows during her short tenure. She could come on this show. Joining us now, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=103.84s)]
*  Paul Butler, former federal prosecutor and MSNBC legal analyst, and Liz Euer, former DOJ pardon [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=108.48s)]
*  attorney and federal public defender. Thank you both very much for being here. Sorry for [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  choking on my own words and talking about that. But Paul, could you please just explain to viewers [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=119.84s)]
*  how the way Bondi is conducting herself in her job as attorney general of the United States [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=128.96s)]
*  is so problematic? And did you also hear what what Eugene and I heard in that thing? She kind of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=136.16s)]
*  choked on one tier of justice, one tier of justice in those confirmation hearings. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=143.2s)]
*  So, Jonathan, when I was a federal prosecutor and went to court, I would say, my name is Paul Butler [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=148.48s)]
*  and I represent the United States of America. That's what every federal prosecutor says, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=153.6s)]
*  except that pale Bondi represents Donald Trump. She's the attorney general of his dreams because [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=158.32s)]
*  she's really more of a political operative. He's talked about it a long time. He's wanted that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=165.04s)]
*  He's gotten it. Yeah. So again, when she says that she the department is independent, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=170.32s)]
*  it's not like it's been independent in the previous 200 years. Again, she seems to be [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=176.24s)]
*  taking marching orders from Trump about who to investigate and who to prosecute, including by [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=181.36s)]
*  putting Cash Patel and Don Boningo in charge of federal investigations, in charge of what used to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  be the world's best law enforcement agency. They have less experience than any other [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=195.44000000000003s)]
*  leaders of that agency in the last 100 years. Liz, you are suing the DOJ for records related [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=201.84s)]
*  to your termination, for your refusal to restore Mel Gibson's gun rights. There are others who have [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=207.76s)]
*  resigned because they didn't want to do something that the administration wanted them to do. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=214.72s)]
*  What does that do, though, for the American people when lawyers like yourself, who've been doing this [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=219.92s)]
*  for a long time, who are not political, right? Your job is to be there no matter who the president [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  is at the United States, no matter who the attorney general is. What does that do for the justice [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=230.0s)]
*  system in this country? It's really dangerous. I mean, that's the big problem with it, to root out [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=234.4s)]
*  career experts who are trying to use their years of experience to inform the decisions that are [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  being made by the department about key issues related to public safety. That is just dangerous. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=245.84s)]
*  It's irresponsible, it's reckless, and it makes us less safe as a country. In my case, I was fired. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=252.16s)]
*  I didn't resign, I was just fired. And that occurred after I gave my advice based on my [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=258.48s)]
*  experience about what I believed was in the interest of our public safety as a country. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=264.8s)]
*  Paul, Elise here. I would like to talk about the Trump DOJ's move to basically take out the layer [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=270.64s)]
*  of checks and balance, so to say, before indicting a member of Congress and making it easier to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=278.0s)]
*  indict members of Congress, federal prosecutors around the country. It'll be easier for them. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=283.68s)]
*  What is this going to change in the law and in the way that corruption cases against public [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  officials have been previously pursued? And would this work both ways if it stays in effect [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=297.6s)]
*  so extensively? And if Democrats empower, they could essentially do the same thing. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=305.04s)]
*  Yes. So Elise, I worked at the Public Integrity Section, and whenever there was a considered [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  prosecution of a Congress person, we had to sign off on it. Even if the prosecution and investigation [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=316.24s)]
*  originated in a U.S. Attorney's office, we had to sign off on it because we were the experts. We knew [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=322.96s)]
*  what was going on all over the country. We understood how this potential prosecution weighed in [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=328.88s)]
*  with regard to the other work that the Department of Justice was doing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=334.96s)]
*  And so now this proposed move to take that layer of review out. If a U.S. Attorney wants to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=340.0s)]
*  prosecute a Congress person, then he or she can. They still have to get the approval of the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=346.56s)]
*  Attorney General, but as we were just discussing, that person is pale and bondy. She's going to say [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=352.32s)]
*  yes to whatever Donald Trump wants, including now this potential of political prosecutions. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=356.88s)]
*  Think about what happened in New Jersey where allegedly Congress people are being [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=362.96s)]
*  investigated now for just doing their job, for going to a facility that they're supposed to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=369.28s)]
*  conduct oversight of. So typically that would come to the Public Integrity Section. We'd say [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=373.52s)]
*  yes or no. That can be prosecuted. Now if Alina Havel wants to do that, she can. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  This gets to retribution. The President made it clear during the campaign that he [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=385.67999999999995s)]
*  he was going to go after his political enemies. And the moment he got inaugurated, he just started [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=391.84s)]
*  and he continues. I think we have a graphic of the prominent people that he has targeted. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=397.04s)]
*  Paul talked about the Mayor of Newark, Ross Baraka, the potential of arrests of members of Congress. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=404.96s)]
*  But he's also gone after judges and prosecutors. What does that do to the people like yourself, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=412.08s)]
*  like you and Paul, former prosecutors who are the front line in terms of the defense [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  of the rule of law? Yeah, so it's a total misuse of the department's resources. The resources of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  the Department of Justice are meant to keep us safe, to uphold our laws and to uphold our civil [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=432.24s)]
*  rights. And they're being used right now to defeat those very interests, which is very concerning. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=437.44s)]
*  What's happening with the leadership of the department is the shots are really being called [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  in the White House. The New York Times article you referenced reported that Stephen Miller, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=447.76s)]
*  who is not even an attorney, is actually the person who is making all of the decisions that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=452.08s)]
*  are then being pushed down to the Department of Justice. So that is not how things have ever [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=458.8s)]
*  operated in our history. And it's on issues that are big and important, but it's also on [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=463.76s)]
*  minutiae. And if I could just share a quick anecdote. When I was at the department before [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=469.04s)]
*  I was fired, we were getting bombarded daily with these orders from the attorney general. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=474.88s)]
*  Pam Bondi is signing memos to the workforce that are giving us our marching orders, telling us, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=480.4s)]
*  you are all the president's lawyers, carry out his mission. And it got down so far into the minutia [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=485.76s)]
*  that we got a memo to the 115,000 employees of the department saying the Department of Justice [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=491.68s)]
*  is abolishing paper straws because the president doesn't like paper straws. So it is our obligation [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=498.0s)]
*  attorneys in the Department of Justice to eradicate the scourge of paper straws and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=505.12s)]
*  replace them with plastic. I mean, it's lunatum. There are real things happening in this country, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=510.64000000000004s)]
*  serious things that people are dealing with. It doesn't matter what side of the spectrum [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=515.6s)]
*  you're on politically. And so I mean, cops, that the people who spend their lives thinking [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=519.84s)]
*  about the rule of law, defending and protecting the rule of law, the constitution are being asked [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=530.0s)]
*  to do things just because Donald Trump doesn't want to do them. I guess I probably shouldn't be [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=535.6s)]
*  as shocked as I am because of where we are politically. But I guess, I just can't believe. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=539.92s)]
*  What is the mood inside DOJ as these things have happened? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=551.68s)]
*  Well, a lot of people took advantage of the second DOJ buyout offer recently because they [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=556.0s)]
*  declined the first one. They saw how things were going. And after seeing it for a couple of months, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=563.92s)]
*  they said, oh no, this is not for me. So people have fled the department. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=568.4s)]
*  Brainger. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=572.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, lots of incredibly smart, talented lawyers who have spent [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=573.6s)]
*  years or even decades at the department have left because the morale is low and people feel [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=578.8s)]
*  like they do not have the freedom to share their views. And they feel like they're not [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=584.32s)]
*  supported in their mission. And they feel like they're being asked to do things that are not [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  appropriate. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgOBVXrcOE0&t=594.4000000000001s)]
