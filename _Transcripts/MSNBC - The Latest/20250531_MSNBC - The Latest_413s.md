# Trump ‘will do anything to suit his own interests’ amid controversial pardons: Fmr. Republican
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA)
*  President Trump now saying more big-name pardons could be on the way after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=0.0s)]
*  already issuing 27 pardons and commutations just this week, including [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  for reality TV stars Julie and Todd Chrisley, convicted of fraud and tax [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  evasion who were released from federal prison. Trump also said he's looking into [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  possible pardons for the men convicted of planning to kidnap Michigan Governor [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=17.42s)]
*  Gretchen Whitmer and he didn't rule out a pardon for Sean Diddy Combs currently [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=21.46s)]
*  on trial for sex trafficking. Michael Hardaway and Ashley Pratt-Oates are back [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=26.5s)]
*  with me. That last one, that was a stunner actually and let's talk about [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=31.38s)]
*  U.S. pardon attorney Ed Martin Michael who thanked Trump for pardoning Scott [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=35.68s)]
*  Jenkins, a former sheriff in Virginia convicted of accepting over $75,000 in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=40.74s)]
*  bribes writing, no MAGA left behind. Is that the clearest sign yet of just how [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=45.58s)]
*  simple the path can be for Trump allies to potentially pick up a get out of jail [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=50.94s)]
*  free card? This is a shame. Now remember Donald Trump has pardoned a litany of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=55.46s)]
*  criminals from the criminals who tried to overturn the election on January the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=60.78s)]
*  6th to his son-in-law's father who was indicted 18 times on criminal charges [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=65.12s)]
*  and has now been given the best ambassadorship there is which is a [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=70.54s)]
*  U.S. ambassador to France. This is shocking but not really because Donald [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=75.38s)]
*  Trump himself is a criminal who has a number of felonies and so I'm not sure [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=79.98s)]
*  what the litmus test is in terms of how to get a pardon here but if you're a [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=84.42s)]
*  criminal in America and certainly a Trump connected or rich criminal it's a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=88.22s)]
*  great time to be you. You know Ashley the New York Times describes the pardons as [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=92.78s)]
*  quote a wholesale effort to redefine crime looking to downplay white-collar [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=97.38s)]
*  crime in particular not far removed though from his own accusations and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=103.34s)]
*  convictions to Michael's point is that his motivation in addition to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=107.78s)]
*  getting I don't know potential leverage for himself? Yeah he's using pardons to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=113.78s)]
*  suit his own political agenda here and he's made it very clear that he thinks [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=119.86s)]
*  he has been wrongly accused of these things right I mean he's made that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  abundantly clear so he's on a war path right now again to suit his own [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=129.9s)]
*  political agenda move the needle forward where he can wherever it suits him and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=134.34s)]
*  he is redefining it he thinks corruption and fraud are no big deal and this [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=138.62s)]
*  should be something that concerns us all to all of the points that have been [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=143.14s)]
*  made here because again redefining this wholesale is again saying corruption and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=146.73999999999998s)]
*  fraud are okay I think this is something that again should be concerning [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=152.17999999999998s)]
*  especially at the frequency which he's doing it but he has shown that again he [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=156.29999999999998s)]
*  will do anything to suit his own interests and that's exactly what this [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  is and we should expect more of it. And Michael David Frum writes about what he [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=163.1s)]
*  calls Trump's world historical heist and the billions of dollars that he has [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=167.82s)]
*  accumulating through foreign deals and Frum says quote the brazenness of the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=172.74s)]
*  self-enrichment resembles nothing seen in any earlier White House he adds while [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  prior administrations have had money scandals quote the presidents at the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=181.82000000000002s)]
*  center of them have almost always been motivated by misplaced loyalty to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=185.9s)]
*  others rather than their personal greed is that Michael why this feels different [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=190.82000000000002s)]
*  than past presidential corruption and what's the remedy? That and just the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=196.18s)]
*  massive scale Donald Trump has made at least three billion dollars this year [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=201.64s)]
*  alone during the presidency when he makes all of these decisions around [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=205.55999999999997s)]
*  pardons or around foreign deals or whatever it may be and we can't figure [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=209.44s)]
*  out why the answer just might be this secretive account that he has set up [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=213.55999999999997s)]
*  that allows him to take anonymous donations from anywhere in the world [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  which is this crypto meme account and so we've never seen anything like this and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=220.67999999999998s)]
*  I think in terms of scale this might be the greatest grift in American history [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=225.92s)]
*  with Donald Trump being the greatest con man in American history it's [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=229.68s)]
*  incredibly problematic the speaker and leader to have to step in and do [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=233.22s)]
*  something to save the republic and protect us all but actually when [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  questioned about Trump's alleged corruption the White House and top [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=241.56s)]
*  Republicans like Mike Johnson have repeatedly said he's doing everything [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=244.52s)]
*  out in the open that he doesn't have anything to hide is that all that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=248.64s)]
*  matters I mean are Americans gonna buy that his actions are ethically or [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=253.36s)]
*  legally fine as long as he's openly admitting them I think his brazenness [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=256.84s)]
*  should concern us all but apparently the party that has said that they're the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=262.11999999999995s)]
*  party of rule and law it only seems to be when they can define what rules and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=266.35999999999996s)]
*  laws they should actually follow which again we see with the pardons we see [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  with the corruption we see with Trump profiting and his business is profiting [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=275.12s)]
*  as a result of him being president but you know his followers can't lock her up [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=279.47999999999996s)]
*  when Clinton was running again all of these things that are just going to come [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  back to haunt Republicans I think in elections that come after Trump again [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=287.64000000000004s)]
*  these were all things that we were warned about time after time and many of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  us warned about when Trump was running for the re-election again and he's just [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=296.56s)]
*  so brazen about it this time because he believes he has a mandate to do so I [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=300.6s)]
*  wouldn't be surprised if again because he thinks the Constitution can be bent [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=304.04s)]
*  at his will he even tries to run for a third term which again we've heard some [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=308.24s)]
*  rumblings of there are hats out there so we'll see what ends up happening but [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=313.12s)]
*  again the brazenness is what should concern Mike Johnson not the fact that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=317.32s)]
*  all of this is just being done in the open you know Michael the Washington [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=320.84s)]
*  Post now reports that Qatar did not offer Trump that private jet as he had [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=324.64s)]
*  claimed instead it was the Trump administration that approached Qatar [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  through a sale and the country later agreed to provide it as a gift but what [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=332.88s)]
*  does it tell you I mean what kind of deal could Trump have made for Qatar to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=337.24s)]
*  gift it for free excellent question and again it goes back to this secret of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=341.56s)]
*  meme coin account in terms of these decisions he's making on trade on [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=346.96s)]
*  tariffs on everything what is the litmus test behind it are people just [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=351.52s)]
*  feeding money to this guy through this secretive account and getting what they [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=356.12s)]
*  want I don't know the answer to that question but Congress should figure this [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=360.32s)]
*  out and Republicans in Congress have to because this is incredibly problematic [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=363.44s)]
*  you can't have the president possibly making decisions based on who gives him [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=367.64s)]
*  the largest bribe the fact that he's out there begging for a free plane is [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=371.68s)]
*  shocking it really is shocking if the president of the United States is going [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  to inform government a begging for a free plane when he already has one also [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=380.28s)]
*  by the way he claims to be a billionaire he can buy his own plane if that's the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=384.96s)]
*  case Michael Hardaway and Ashley Prado it's good to see you both thank you so [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=388.4s)]
*  much [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gXtCoGPTOA&t=392.64s)]
