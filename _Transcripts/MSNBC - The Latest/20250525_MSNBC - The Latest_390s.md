# 'Go where your talents are wanted': Jonathan Capehart's talks new book ‘Yet Here I Am’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM)
*  The time has come. Our friend and colleague, our hero Jonathan Capehart's new book is out, yet here I am. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=0.0s)]
*  Lessons from Black Man, Search for Home. It is fabulous. I have read it multiple times at this point. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=8.0s)]
*  He recounts stories from his life about embracing identity, picking battles, seizing opportunity, and finding his voice. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=15.0s)]
*  I want to read something from the book that has stuck with me and I just can't get it out of my head. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=24.0s)]
*  Rita, he says he's pretty cousin Rita, that's what he calls her in the book. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=36.0s)]
*  Rita and I were not yet aware that we were enjoying our freedom as the first generation in our family to never have to pick cotton. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=40.0s)]
*  Slaves bent their backs to pick it. Even after the Civil War that freed them, generations of their descendants, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=47.0s)]
*  our parents, aunts, uncles, and distant cousins continued their work for pittance. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=52.0s)]
*  Because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 enacted exactly three years to the day before I was born, the duty stopped with Joe Nathan's and Isla May's grandchildren. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=56.0s)]
*  And I mean, I mean. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=66.0s)]
*  So I wanted to put that in historical context to remind people that this country has only been free for slightly longer than 50 years. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=74.0s)]
*  I'm 57 and you don't look at it. Well, thank you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=85.0s)]
*  But when we were running around in the yard in North Carolina, as I was writing this book, I realized, wait, Rita and I won the first generation in our family that didn't have to pick cotton. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=89.0s)]
*  But also we were among the first generation to truly live free in America. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=100.0s)]
*  Day, you're a freedom. The words in the Constitution officially applied to us. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=107.0s)]
*  And so why by framing it that way, I wanted people to understand that freedom in America is new, brand new. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=113.0s)]
*  And the old ways of America are still in the memories of people who are still with us and they aren't that old. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=122.0s)]
*  I was lucky enough to get an early copy from you. I actually begged you for one. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=131.0s)]
*  I was on a lie harassing for it and got it. And then I was on a flight and I realized I had read through 10 chapters without stopping. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=137.0s)]
*  It was a longer flight out to L.A. And it was so engaging. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=146.0s)]
*  And the first part of the book, especially where you do talk about the South and going down with your grandmother and you talk about how she was a Jehovah's Witness and witnessing, witnessing is a big thing to go around and to tell everyone about. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=150.0s)]
*  And yes, and so you would go with her. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=166.0s)]
*  And so talk about what you learned and what an impact it made on your life. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=169.0s)]
*  Those experiences, those experiences were the first stories I wrote down in 2017. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=174.0s)]
*  They had been in my head basically since I was a kid. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=179.0s)]
*  Grandma being a Jehovah's Witness, going witnessing with my grandmother, which is down south, which is completely different than the way it's done, way it's done up north. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=183.0s)]
*  You can see my grandma come in in her car and you know, we'll go into these homes almost always African-Americans. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=192.0s)]
*  And I remember seeing the three portraits that I started calling the Holy Black Trinity, Kennedy, King and Christ. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=200.0s)]
*  And sometimes there was RFK on the wall and just the smell of the homes, the look of toil on the faces. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=205.0s)]
*  I remember and as I put it down and that is where in those visits where I formed the way I look at race, the way I look at my country was formed during those encounters. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=215.0s)]
*  In this book, as people have been buying it and reading and as you've been going around, what are the lessons you hoped to share with people? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=229.0s)]
*  What are the things you wanted people to leave? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=237.0s)]
*  So that's the other the other reason why I wanted to put my story down is that I've learned a lot in in my life and I wanted to share the lessons that I learned because I want people who might not be black, might not be LGBTQ. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=238.0s)]
*  But maybe we have had the same experiences. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=253.0s)]
*  And so here here's what I here's what I've learned. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=256.0s)]
*  And maybe it will help you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=259.0s)]
*  The number one lesson being when someone asks you what you want, tell them. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=260.0s)]
*  I had someone told tell me that they would always under underplay what they wanted in the hopes that maybe they would rise. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=265.0s)]
*  And I was like, no, absolutely. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=273.0s)]
*  Tell them what you want. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=275.0s)]
*  And that's what I did. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=276.0s)]
*  Someone asks me what I want. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=278.0s)]
*  I tell them. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=279.0s)]
*  And that's how I got my internship at the Today Show. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=280.0s)]
*  That's how I got my job at Bloomberg News as a columnist. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=282.0s)]
*  I didn't want to work there. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=285.0s)]
*  And he said, what do you want to do? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=286.0s)]
*  I told him and he said, well, why can't you do that here? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=287.0s)]
*  The other one is go where your talents are wanted. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=290.0s)]
*  A lot of people sometimes are in places where they are they're busting their asses. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=294.0s)]
*  They're doing really good work, but they're not getting the recognition. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=299.0s)]
*  But someone over there is saying, hey, come over here and do this. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=302.0s)]
*  Hey, come over here and do that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=305.0s)]
*  And that's what I ended up doing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=307.0s)]
*  Moderating panels around the world, hosting radio shows. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=309.0s)]
*  And then the other thing, the final lesson is everything we do in life is an audition for something else. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=313.0s)]
*  We just don't know what yet. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=321.0s)]
*  And because I was doing all what seemed to be all these disparate things, they ended up being forming the template that makes it possible for me to sit here right now. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=323.0s)]
*  It was inspiring. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=334.0s)]
*  It made me think I got to go out there and apply some of Jonathan's wisdom. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=335.0s)]
*  But it really was a beautiful book. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=339.0s)]
*  And you write so well and it's so engaging. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=341.0s)]
*  And for MSNBC viewers, there also is a cameo from our favorite Reverend Al Sharpe. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=344.0s)]
*  Yes, there's a couple. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=350.0s)]
*  There's a really look. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=351.0s)]
*  There's a great story about me, Reverend Sharpton, Reverend Jackson, which is how I met Reverend Sharpton and a suit. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=353.0s)]
*  Everyone's heard about the box, but no one's talked about. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=361.0s)]
*  You got to buy the book to read that story. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=364.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=367.0s)]
*  Yes, you do. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=368.0s)]
*  You. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HiBrgaYsgM&t=380.0s)]
