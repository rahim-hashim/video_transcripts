# ‘Hidden struggle’: New reporting on Sen. John Fetterman draws concerns
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno)
*  I first interviewed now Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania on this show just about 10 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=0.0s)]
*  years ago, back in the fall of 2015. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=6.72s)]
*  He was running for the Democratic nomination in the Pennsylvania Senate race. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=9.4s)]
*  I gotta say, I mean, you know, it seems like you've done great work there, but it's a town [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=14.84s)]
*  of 3,000 people. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=19.04s)]
*  I mean, that is a very, very big leap. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=20.04s)]
*  What makes you qualify to be U.S. Senator going from this position, which is a pretty [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=22.56s)]
*  on the ground position? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=26.84s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  I think it makes me uniquely qualified because all of the issues that we have dealt with [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=29.24s)]
*  in Braddock, again, inequality, safe community policing and health care, all these different [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=33.08s)]
*  challenges are just the same issues, but we're going to scale it up to statewide. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=40.4s)]
*  It's the same game played in a bigger stadium. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=47.379999999999995s)]
*  Fetterman was a fascinating guy, is a fascinating guy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=51.76s)]
*  He was the mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, a small town just outside of Pittsburgh, and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=53.4s)]
*  lost that Senate primary race in 2016. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  He then went on to be elected lieutenant governor and then he won the Senate primary in 2022. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=59.8s)]
*  And that year I was able to speak with him again as a Democratic nominee just four months [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=64.0s)]
*  after he suffered a stroke on the campaign trail. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  He's now the senator from Pennsylvania. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=72.92s)]
*  The last time he was on this show was in September 2023. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  We've not spoken to Senator Fetterman since then, but today a new article in New York [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=77.16s)]
*  Magazine gives a really eye opening and at times profoundly unnerving look into Fetterman's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  world from his health, both physical and mental, his politics, and urgent concerns [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=86.48s)]
*  among those closest to him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=91.4s)]
*  Joining me now is Ben Terrace, the Washington correspondent for New York Magazine who reported [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=93.08s)]
*  out that article. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=97.4s)]
*  And Ben, I have to say this was one of those pieces that I had my jaw on the floor for [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=98.4s)]
*  much of it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  It's an incredible piece of reporting. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  So thanks for your excellent work. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=106.68s)]
*  The major headline here and what is a very long piece is that some of the people closest [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=109.68s)]
*  to Senator Fetterman, I mean really close, are extremely concerned about his well-being [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  and mental health. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=119.63999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=121.63999999999999s)]
*  It was a really hard story to work on to be honest. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  It was a sad story. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  These are a lot of people who truly believed in Fetterman for a long time and some of them [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  have political disagreements with him now and a lot of people want to make this all [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=133.64s)]
*  about political disagreements. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=136.64s)]
*  But these are people who are genuinely worried about him. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=138.6s)]
*  They had a hard time working for him and they want to see him get back on his recovery plan. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=141.56s)]
*  They feel like he has fallen off the recovery plan that he was on. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=147.0s)]
*  Basically this is someone who had a stroke in the campaign, had to come back from that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=150.6s)]
*  stroke and go campaign even as he is having severe auditory processing issues as a result, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=154.16s)]
*  which is a nightmare if you have to talk all the time. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=160.16s)]
*  He manages to get elected and then he checks himself into Walter Reed for six weeks for [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=163.44s)]
*  depression. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=167.4s)]
*  What are the people closest to him seeing that has them so worried? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=168.92s)]
*  Well at the time, that was a really worrying time because he had to check into Walter Reed [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=174.28s)]
*  to begin with. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=178.27999999999997s)]
*  As I report in the story, he kind of had a little bit of a break I'd say where he no [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=179.48s)]
*  longer could do the job without getting help. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=187.72s)]
*  So he goes to the hospital and at the hospital he gets treatment. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  When he comes out of the hospital after kind of a harrowing visit there for a while, he [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  levels out and things are good for a long time. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=196.92s)]
*  Everybody that was working for him is really proud of him. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=200.83999999999997s)]
*  They feel like he's done a really important thing here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=203.76s)]
*  He has helped destigmatize mental health. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  He's proving that people who have mental health issues are able to do this job if they get [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  treatment. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  But over time, some of the people that I talked to started to believe that maybe he wasn't [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  as good as he had let on and that behind the scenes they were having a very difficult time [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  with him where he would shut down, he wouldn't do the job. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=226.4s)]
*  There would be days where they'd have to clear his schedule so he wouldn't kind of be around [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=230.04s)]
*  people saying what was described as unhinged stuff. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=233.84s)]
*  And eventually it got to a point where one of these former staffers sent a long email [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  to Senator Fetterman's doctor to kind of, I don't know, I'd say ring the alarm bell [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=243.72s)]
*  that things weren't going well. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=250.2s)]
*  That's Adam Jenelson, the staffer who's named in the piece that you talked to. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=252.8s)]
*  I should say you talked to him. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=256.04s)]
*  You also talked to Fetterman himself. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=257.04s)]
*  You talked to people around him. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=258.04s)]
*  Fetterman does speak to you for the piece. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=259.48s)]
*  Jenelson's been a frequent guest on this program. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=261.12s)]
*  Here's just one little bit of color. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=263.32s)]
*  This is Sherrod Brown right before that hospital admission. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=264.96s)]
*  Or I guess a week after his hospital discharge, Democratic Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown came [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=269.2s)]
*  to pay Fetterman a visit in his new Capitol Hill office. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=274.44s)]
*  Their meeting went awry. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=277.24s)]
*  Brown tried his best to get a conversation going. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  But according to two people present, Fetterman was virtually catatonic. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=281.08s)]
*  He was doing essentially kind of figure eights up and down and not talking to the senator. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=284.1s)]
*  This really freaked out a lot of folks. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=291.02000000000004s)]
*  Was that part of what got him in Walter Reed or that was after Walter Reed? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=294.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=297.94s)]
*  That's what got him to Walter Reed. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=298.94s)]
*  So before that, he had a moment where he had to go to George Washington because he was [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=300.3s)]
*  suffering from dehydration and was at a retreat and kind of wandered into the street and was [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=305.18s)]
*  almost hit by a car, according to my reporting, and went to GW. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=310.28s)]
*  And a week later, he has this moment. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=314.4s)]
*  And after this happens, the staff calls the doctor in the Senate, I believe, and they [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=316.53999999999996s)]
*  all agree it's time to get him to Walter Reed for some serious treatment. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=321.4s)]
*  Now one of the things that's publicly clear is a change in the political trajectory of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  Fetterman who had been kind of he had been endorsed by Bernie Sanders. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  He had been sort of the progressive wing of the party. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=335.0s)]
*  I talked to him about his in that interview I did a long time ago to his wife who came [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=338.0s)]
*  here when she was undocumented. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=341.6s)]
*  He gave a very spirited defense of her being here. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=342.6s)]
*  And he has moved to the right, I think, on a number of key issues. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=346.88s)]
*  He still votes with the Democrats, mostly, but particularly on Israel and Gaza. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=350.72s)]
*  And there's some really unnerving things that you report him saying. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=355.72s)]
*  He went on to make statements that shocked people. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=360.86s)]
*  In opposing a ceasefire, he said, let's get back to killing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=362.92s)]
*  A person who heard the conversation told me he said, kill them all. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=365.92s)]
*  In a statement, Fetterman denied the account, adding any reference to killing was solely [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=369.36s)]
*  about Hamas. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=372.6s)]
*  I do support the destruction of that organization down to its last member. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=373.6s)]
*  When a representative of a progressive pro-Israel group, Jeremy Ben-Ami, had a conversation [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=377.62s)]
*  about a two-state solution, he said to Palestinians, you can't reform sour milk. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=382.20000000000005s)]
*  What do people around him make of his politics on this question? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=388.0s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=392.36s)]
*  People don't really know exactly where it came from. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=395.42s)]
*  He says he's been pro-Israel forever. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=397.26s)]
*  And he probably has been to a degree. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=400.1s)]
*  It's the rhetoric that is shocking people so much. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=401.78s)]
*  It's the fact that he is the most outspoken Israel hawk in the entire Democratic Party, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=404.1s)]
*  it seems like, that's surprising to people. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=409.18s)]
*  And I don't want to make the claim that this has anything to do with his mental health. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=411.74s)]
*  I think that people are surprised by this because it seems out of character for the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=415.54s)]
*  man who kind of exuded empathy. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=420.54s)]
*  His radical empathy was a big part of who he was. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=424.41999999999996s)]
*  And this kind of rhetoric just does not square with that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=427.5s)]
*  This is what I want to sort of, you don't sort of define, say this definitively, but [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=430.58s)]
*  in the last 35 seconds here, I mean, you don't want to pathologize someone's politics. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=434.65999999999997s)]
*  And yet, this is a person who suffered an enormous trauma, health-wise. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=440.41999999999996s)]
*  Like, is he a different person? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDheR0LSno&t=444.85999999999996s)]
