# Trump admin will 'exaggerate the illegal activity that is taking place’: Peters on L.A. protests
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0)
*  Welcome back. President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in LA is sparking a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=0.0s)]
*  new wave of legal questions and uncertainty. The president is citing a rarely used federal [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=4.44s)]
*  law that allows him to be put atop the chain of command in order to deploy 2,000 California [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=9.72s)]
*  National Guard troops. Now Governor Gavin Newsom tells NBC's Jacob Soboroff he'll file [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=14.8s)]
*  a lawsuit challenging that authority. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=19.56s)]
*  He's exacerbated the conditions. He's, you know, lit the Burberry Hill match. He's putting [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=23.56s)]
*  fuel on this fire ever since he announced he was taking over the National Guard in a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=27.64s)]
*  legal act, in a moral act, an unconstitutional act, and we're going to test that theory with [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=32.4s)]
*  a lawsuit. Under his executive order, and specifically notes, and under what the DOD [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=36.32s)]
*  did, is they had to coordinate with the governor of the state. They never coordinate with the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=41.32s)]
*  governor of the state. There was no problem working collaboratively in a mutual aid system [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=45.44s)]
*  with local law enforcement, but there's a protocol, there's a process. He didn't care [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=49.72s)]
*  about that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=53.16s)]
*  Joining us now is James Sample, Hofstra University professor of law, and here with me on set [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=55.44s)]
*  MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin and Jeremy Peters, New York Times reporter and an MSNBC [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=59.96s)]
*  contributor. Lisa, we'll start with you. Does the governor have a successful argument in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=65.2s)]
*  this legal challenge that he's set to make? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=69.6s)]
*  I think that he might, Ali, and obviously the instances in which a governor of the state [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=72.4s)]
*  has sued the president of the United States for invoking a federal authority to call in [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=77.52s)]
*  the National Guard are few and far between. If there are any, I can't recall them off [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=81.72s)]
*  the top of my head. The statute that Trump is basing this memorandum off of essentially [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=86.0s)]
*  says that the president can call in the National Guard as federal service whenever the United [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=90.32s)]
*  States is invaded or in danger of invasion by a foreign nation, or for example, there [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=96.4s)]
*  is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=101.0s)]
*  States. And that's where I think Governor Newsom does have a point that whatever is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=105.6s)]
*  going on in Los Angeles right now, which both he and Mayor Karen Bass say that LAPD in combination [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=109.28s)]
*  with existing federal civilian law enforcement had well in hand. It's not an invasion. It's [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  not a danger of an invasion and it's not a rebellion or a danger of a rebellion. Statutorily, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=119.6s)]
*  they're going to say it doesn't fit. They're also going to say it's an infringement in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  all likelihood of their 10th Amendment rights as a state to be free from certain interference [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=128.2s)]
*  by the federal government. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think that's all really important, especially when you take it in context of how the administration [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  has talked about immigration over the course of the last several years, both on the campaign [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=138.42s)]
*  trail and here in the White House, this idea that there is some kind of a national emergency [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=142.42s)]
*  around it. I imagine that's something that we could hear in this legal filing from their [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=147.17999999999998s)]
*  side once, of course, the legal part of this is fully underway. But James, there seems [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=151.94s)]
*  to be some uncertainty over the law that's cited in Trump's order, justifying the deployment [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=157.14s)]
*  of the National Guard. So what exactly would that law permit? And does this current scenario [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=161.61999999999998s)]
*  constitute the kind of major crisis that would fit it? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  It's a really good question. And to Lisa's point and Lisa's answer to your question, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=171.08s)]
*  Ali, we are in uncharted territory. And I feel like we say that over and over again [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=174.98000000000002s)]
*  in the Trump administration, in all sorts of contexts, we talk about aggressive, aggressive [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=180.5s)]
*  uses of executive power. We talk about unprecedented or uncharted waters. This really is that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=185.10000000000002s)]
*  And as a number of your prior guests in the earlier segment said, when you haven't done [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=191.5s)]
*  in this instance, invoking this particular law since 1965, I mean, not only were you [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=196.1s)]
*  not alive in 1965, even I wasn't alive in 1965. That was not yesterday. So when we're [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=202.01999999999998s)]
*  talking about something that is used that rarely, and by that rarely, we mean in the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=207.42s)]
*  absence of the governor's request, the governor's consent, we just don't have a whole lot of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  guideposts in terms of the legal framework for whether or not this is constitutional. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=219.26s)]
*  But to Lisa's point on the constitutional framework, we are really now in the upside [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=223.7s)]
*  down. If you think about the left right dichotomy of America, the red blue dichotomy of America, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=228.54s)]
*  normally the federalism argument, the federalism, the 10th Amendment point is the point being [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=234.06s)]
*  pressed by conservatives, by Republicans, generally speaking, in relatively conservative [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=239.7s)]
*  states against, for example, the Affordable Care Act. Here, we're flipping that system [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  entirely on its head. We're flipping that frame entirely on its head. And we're talking [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=251.86s)]
*  about a Republican president of the United States invoking an executive authority that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=255.78s)]
*  is, I think at this point, so far, my answer to whether or not what he's done so far is [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=261.54s)]
*  illegal is, I think it's ill-advised but not yet illegal. If, however, these individuals [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=267.14s)]
*  who have been co-opted and constricted into the federal force from the State National [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=273.72s)]
*  Guard are called upon to do things that they are not authorized to do under Section 10, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=278.62s)]
*  Title 10, as opposed to under the Insurrection Act, which has not yet been invoked, then [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  in that scenario, I think California is likely to have a very successful challenge on its [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=289.66s)]
*  hands. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=294.54s)]
*  And those are, I think, some really helpful goalposts for us as we try to continue watching [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=295.54s)]
*  and then layering the legal ramifications on top of what we're seeing on the ground. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=299.26s)]
*  And we've talked here about how there are so few precedents for us to pull on. Yamiche [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=303.78000000000003s)]
*  was actually teeing us up with one of the few of them, which is the last time a president [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=308.16s)]
*  sent National Guard troops in to deal with civil unrest without cooperation from a state's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=313.32000000000005s)]
*  governor, which was in 1965, when Yamiche was mentioning this, President Lyndon B. Johnson [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=317.68s)]
*  bypassed Alabama's governor to protect civil rights demonstrators marching from Selma to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=322.88000000000005s)]
*  Montgomery. These present circumstances aren't that, Jeremy, and yet it's where the most [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=327.56s)]
*  recent historical precedent that we have. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=333.16s)]
*  Right. And I doubt that that historical precedent even occurred to Trump as he was making this [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=335.24s)]
*  decision. This is not an administration, a White House that feels very bound by history, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=342.2s)]
*  or it would seem the Constitution even. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  So what this stems from is not only a disregard for norms and laws, but also the feeling that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=350.08s)]
*  Trump missed out on a chance to do this in 2020, when there actually was an emergency, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  when cities like Minneapolis were really under siege by violent protesters and businesses [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=366.0s)]
*  got looted and burned. You're talking about a thousand businesses damaged in Minneapolis [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=371.4s)]
*  alone. That was a scenario where you could have seen the need for an act this serious. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  So they've been, you know, they've had this itchy trigger figure for so long now, just [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  waiting for an opportunity to do this. And they kind of blow it with this really sporadic [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=386.64s)]
*  protest activity in Los Angeles. Yes, a lot of it was bad. They're burning of cars, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=392.8s)]
*  assaulting ICE officers. That stuff is clearly illegal. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=398.59999999999997s)]
*  And I don't hear, by the way, any Democrats out there saying that they like that, that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=402.36s)]
*  that's good, that they should be, you know, this is a First Amendment act protected under [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=406.2s)]
*  the Constitution. No, there are clearly anarchists in these protests that need to be dealt with [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=410.64s)]
*  swiftly by law enforcement. But it's a pretty like compare these pictures to what we saw [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=415.68s)]
*  in the summer of 2020. And this is not the kind of incident that Trump would have justification [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=421.6s)]
*  for taking a step this serious. And yet you and I have covered this group of people around [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  the president for almost 10 years now. This is a group that I think tries to find moments [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  of opportunity. I mean, what do you think the conversations are that are happening inside [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  the president's inner circle, which, as we were pointing out in the last segment, has way [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=443.08s)]
*  less guardrails this time around than at any point in 2016 or during his time out of office, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=447.2s)]
*  but campaigning to get back in in 2020 and 2024? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=452.2s)]
*  I can tell you exactly what they are from what I've been told is do it, make an example of [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  these people. And to that end, they will the Trump administration and his acolytes, they [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=458.88s)]
*  will exaggerate the illegal activity that's taking place. They will just as we saw back [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=464.44s)]
*  in 1992, actually, during the Rodney King riots, they will exaggerate the involvement [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=469.64s)]
*  of people here illegally in the protests, you know, anything they can to kind of justify [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=474.0s)]
*  this expect them to do. I just don't think this is the example that is really going to [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=478.16s)]
*  have public opinion behind them. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=484.88s)]
*  And yet it comes against the backdrop. And we'll dig into this later in the show of Stephen [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=486.76s)]
*  Miller and other top officials demanding that ICE do more on the deportation front, criminal [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=490.24s)]
*  history or not. But Lisa, if we can circle back to the legal piece of this, too, you're [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=495.2s)]
*  seeing the White House now have to walk back the idea that maybe they would arrest the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=499.96s)]
*  governor or the mayor if they intervened or interceded in any of these operations on the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  ground. The fact that that walk back even exists. I mean, what does that tell you about [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=508.96s)]
*  the legal line that is once again being towed here? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=512.96s)]
*  I think the legal line is a really fuzzy one. The last time I checked the Constitution, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=516.16s)]
*  deep regret at how you acted in a past scenario is not a constitutional justification. But [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=520.08s)]
*  in terms of I think that was a moment where Tom Homan got a little bit too cute by half, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=525.96s)]
*  right? Because he was asked what would happen if Mayor Bass or Governor Newsom tried to [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=530.5200000000001s)]
*  obstruct law enforcement authority and he said they would be arrested too. I don't think [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  he meant to suggest that they are under investigation. His point was only that obstruction of law [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  enforcement activity would be treated seriously no matter who it's done by. The question [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=544.2s)]
*  here is what constitutes obstruction? If you're not physically obstructing law enforcement [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=548.36s)]
*  with your body, is there a scenario in which this White House would constitute actions [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBMGItvTST0&t=553.4000000000001s)]
