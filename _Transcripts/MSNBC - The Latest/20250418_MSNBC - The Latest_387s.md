# 'This should be shocking': Judge torches Trump admin. for neglecting due process for deportees
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w)
*  This was from the federal courthouse today in Richmond, Virginia, the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=0.0s)]
*  I will read to you from this ruling, quote, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=5.0s)]
*  It is difficult in some cases to get to the very heart of the matter, but in this case it is not hard at all. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=7.0s)]
*  The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=12.0s)]
*  without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=17.0s)]
*  Further, it claims, in essence, that because it has rid itself of custody, that there is nothing that can be done. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=22.0s)]
*  This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=27.0s)]
*  The government asserts that Kilmar Abrego-Garcia is a terrorist and a member of MS-13. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=35.0s)]
*  Perhaps, but perhaps not. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=40.0s)]
*  Regardless, he is still entitled to due process. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=43.0s)]
*  If the government is confident of its position, it should be assured that that position will prevail in proceedings to terminate the withholding of removal order. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=46.0s)]
*  Moreover, the government has conceded that Abrego-Garcia was wrongly or, quote, mistakenly deported. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=55.0s)]
*  Why, then, should it not make what was wrong right? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=60.0s)]
*  Quote, The Supreme Court's decision remains, as always, our guidepost. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=64.0s)]
*  The decision rightly requires the lower federal courts to give due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=69.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court's decision does not, however, allow the government to do essentially nothing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=76.0s)]
*  It requires the government to, quote, facilitate Mr. Abrego-Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=81.0s)]
*  Facilitate is an active verb. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=92.0s)]
*  It requires that steps be taken, as the Supreme Court has made perfectly clear. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=95.0s)]
*  Facilitation does not permit the admittedly erroneous deportation of an individual in disregard of a court order that the government not so subtly spurns. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=100.0s)]
*  Facilitation does not sanction the abrogation of habeas corpus through the transfer of custody to foreign detention centers in the manner attempted here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=109.0s)]
*  Allowing this would, quote, facilitate foreign detention more than it would domestic return. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=118.0s)]
*  It would reduce the rule of law to lawlessness and tarnish the very values for which Americans of diverse views and persuasions have always stood. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=124.0s)]
*  The government is obviously frustrated and displeased with the rulings of the court. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=132.0s)]
*  Let one thing be clear. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=136.0s)]
*  Court rulings are not above criticism. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=138.0s)]
*  Criticism keeps us on our toes and helps us do a better job. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=140.0s)]
*  Court rulings can overstep and they can further intrude upon the prerogatives of other branches. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=143.0s)]
*  Courts thus speak with the knowledge of their imperfections, but also with the sense that they instill a fidelity to law that would be sorely missed in their absence. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=148.0s)]
*  If today the executive branch claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=158.0s)]
*  And what assurance shall there be that the executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=173.0s)]
*  The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present and the executive's obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed would lose its meaning. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=182.0s)]
*  Today, both the U.S. and El Salvadoran governments disclaim any authority and or responsibility to return Mr. Abrego Garcia. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=192.0s)]
*  We are told that neither government has the power to act. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=198.0s)]
*  The result will be to leave matters generally, and Mr. Abrego Garcia specifically, in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=201.0s)]
*  The basic differences between the branches mandate a serious effort at mutual respect. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=210.0s)]
*  The respect that courts must accord the executive must be reciprocated by the executive's respect for the courts. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=215.0s)]
*  Too often today, this has not been the case, as calls for impeachment of judges, for decisions the executive disfavors, and exhortations to disregard court orders sadly illustrate. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=222.0s)]
*  Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=234.0s)]
*  This is a losing proposition all around. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=241.0s)]
*  The judiciary will lose much from the constant intimations of its illegitimacy, to which by custom and detachment we can only sparingly reply. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=244.0s)]
*  But the executive will lose much from a public perception of its lawlessness and all of its attendant contagions. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=253.0s)]
*  The executive may succeed for a time in weakening the courts, but over time history will script the tragic gap between what was and all that might have been. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=262.0s)]
*  And law in time will sign its epitaph. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=274.0s)]
*  It is, as we have noted, all too possible to see in this case an incipient crisis. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=278.0s)]
*  But it may present an opportunity as well. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=283.0s)]
*  We yet cling to the hope that it is not naive to believe our good brethren in the executive branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=285.0s)]
*  This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=294.0s)]
*  While there is still time. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=305.0s)]
*  That ruling today written by a high profile conservative judge on the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=310.0s)]
*  In case it's not obvious, the point of that ruling is to deny the Trump administration what it was asking for, which was an emergency stay to let them avoid what the courts have thus far very plainly ordered them to do. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=317.0s)]
*  This ruling on the Kilmar-Arvrigo-Garcia case in which the Trump administration has been ordered to bring him back to the U.S. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=329.0s)]
*  This, that I just read you, this comes on the heels, of course, of yesterday's ruling that it's not just Kilmar-Arvrigo-Garcia. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=336.0s)]
*  The Trump administration has been ordered to retake U.S. custody of all these guys, of the hundreds of men who the Trump administration sent to El Salvador for potentially life in prison without any courts adjudication as to their fate inside the United States. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=343.0s)]
*  Remarkable, remarkable rulings these last two days, particularly this ruling tonight from the Fourth Circuit. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6_YReina6w&t=360.0s)]
