# Trump doubting Putin is a ‘change of course’: Journalist
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg)
*  Joining me now we have Peter Baker, New York Times chief White House correspondent and MSNBC political analyst and our really good friend [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's get into this Peter because when Zelensky posts this picture [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Saying things like very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic if we achieve joint results [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=10.92s)]
*  Is he trying to appeal to Trump's ego perhaps and try to get him to support? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=16.46s)]
*  Zelensky and Ukraine resume doing so at least and is it working and how much of a victory is it for Zelensky? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  To get this meeting at all during this very short visit [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=30.04s)]
*  Well, I think it was important for Zelensky to get with President Trump in the same room [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=33.24s)]
*  Remember the last time they were in the same room together. It didn't go so well. That was that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=37.84s)]
*  Meltdown right and I think what Zelensky has learned what it seems like he's learned from that is that face-to-face [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=41.64s)]
*  Confrontation with Trump isn't the best way necessarily to get him on your side and Zelensky needs him to be at least somewhat on [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=48.56s)]
*  His side, right? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  So the social media post you showed there demonstrates [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=55.4s)]
*  An interest or desire on Zelensky's part to flatter Trump because that's what foreign leaders have decided is the best way to [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=60.44s)]
*  Try to keep him engaged rather than you know quarrel with him [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=67.64s)]
*  You want to tell him how good he is how he is unique how he can do things and nobody else can do [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=72.34s)]
*  In order to make sure that he is at least semi sympathetic to your point of view [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=76.64s)]
*  That doesn't necessarily mean that Trump is gonna get a good deal out of Putin for Ukraine [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=80.56s)]
*  What they put on the table so far is pretty one-sided [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=85.0s)]
*  in Russia's interest, but Zelensky obviously is trying to like [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=87.96s)]
*  Cokes Trump into having a little bit more understanding of Ukraine's point of view on this. Yeah, I have to say I actually love that picture [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=92.32s)]
*  It is incredible that enormous space and just the two of them all alone [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=99.36s)]
*  Right in the middle of it pretty extraordinary and just this morning Peter [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=103.84s)]
*  You published a piece on how Trump has played into Putin's hands [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=107.4s)]
*  And as you say in his first 100 days [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=111.28s)]
*  You note how Russia has benefited to the point you were just making not only from Trump's direct action and rhetoric regarding the war in Ukraine [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  Notable today after Trump met with Zelensky. He posted about his doubts that Putin even wants to end the war [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=121.0s)]
*  Can you make any sense of where the potential for peace stands? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=128.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's very interesting yet right to hear him say or to read what he said today about how maybe Putin is tapping me [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=133.24s)]
*  I think that was the phrase used happening [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=139.56s)]
*  It was another way of saying playing him the Putin really isn't interested in peace [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=141.56s)]
*  But maybe in fact that he Trump has to be tough on Putin in terms of imposing new sanctions or so forth [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=145.24s)]
*  That is a change of course for him to some extent as Vaughn mentioned [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=151.16s)]
*  He did say the other day Vladimir stopped with regard to the latest missile strike on Keith [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=154.72s)]
*  And it may be that Trump is waking up to the idea that that Putin really is the aggressor here that Putin is the one [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=158.52s)]
*  Who wants this war to continue because Putin is the one who started this war in the first place [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=164.04s)]
*  Now that doesn't mean that Trump has given up on on on a Russia tilted deal again [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=167.96s)]
*  what's on the table right now gives a lot of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=174.60000000000002s)]
*  What Russia would want and what we made the point in the article was there's a whole lot of other things that Trump has [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=177.8s)]
*  done in his first hundred days that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=182.56s)]
*  Is to Russia's benefit whether it's intended that way or not getting rid of things like Voice of America [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  Radio-free Europe the National Endowment for [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=190.52s)]
*  democracy [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=193.8s)]
*  Shutting down efforts to fight Russian [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=195.16s)]
*  Disinformation and kleptocracy and election interference all of those things are things that Moscow of course would have high on his priority list [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=198.76s)]
*  So it's trying to take measure of where Trump is in this early [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=205.64s)]
*  Part of a second term visa v Russia. Well get ready Vladimir Putin because in this post [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=210.44s)]
*  He says he's just tapping me along as you said and the next phrase and has to be dealt with differently [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=216.04s)]
*  Through banking or secondary sanctions, so [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=222.2s)]
*  Let me ask you Peter about Donald Trump who had a pretty lengthy post on truth social with some critical words about your piece [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=226.0s)]
*  And the New York Times is coverage of this war as he blamed both Biden and Obama administrations for the situation in Ukraine [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  It was peppered with personal insults as well [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=240.88s)]
*  How do you respond to something like that both this substance and the nature of the attack? Oh? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=243.33999999999997s)]
*  You know, I mean I think we're all used to it at this point. It's just he does this [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=249.92s)]
*  This is what he's done for last ten years [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=253.2s)]
*  That's not really what's important. What's important is what's going on in terms of these peace talks [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  What's important is what's going on in terms of the US government what's important is what's going on in Ukraine on the ground [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=259.92s)]
*  That's what's important [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=265.48s)]
*  He raises the question about whether or not Obama and Biden deserve [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=266.64s)]
*  Blame or criticism for what happened in Ukraine and of course there are plenty of people who have plenty of criticism for both of those [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=270.36s)]
*  Presidents absolutely, but President Trump is the one who's in office right now [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=276.0s)]
*  It's important for us to cover what he's doing and what the outcomes might be [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBlmzSj3Fg&t=278.96s)]
