# 'No one knows what's going on, mate': Economist on Trump's mixed messages on tariffs
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I)
*  Let's begin with NBC News senior White House correspondent Garrett Haake, business and data [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=0.0s)]
*  correspondent Brian Chung, and professor of economics and public policy at the University [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=4.32s)]
*  of Michigan Justin Wolfers. Garrett, so is there progress with China or not? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=8.96s)]
*  I think it's unclear, Anna, but the signs point to no. If I were to shake my magic eight ball on [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=15.6s)]
*  this, where we are right now is you have the president saying repeatedly that there are some [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=20.88s)]
*  level of talks going on between the United States and China. Meanwhile, his treasury secretary, his [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=25.6s)]
*  top economic advisor, and the Chinese say that's not true. So while there may be kind of a narrow, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  technically accurate way to say that at some level, there are always conversations ongoing [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=37.52s)]
*  between the two largest economies in the world. There's no particular indication that any of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=42.16s)]
*  those conversations are leading anywhere that will end in the tariffs being lowered. And that's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=46.72s)]
*  really what this is all about. The White House is very keen to show progress across the board [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=51.52s)]
*  that they're getting somewhere by using these tariffs as a negotiating tactic. And the Chinese, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=56.64s)]
*  for their part, are saying that may be true, but you're not getting anywhere with us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=61.36s)]
*  Brian, the markets keep spiking and then they're sinking all based on these impromptu comments that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=66.16s)]
*  we keep hearing from President Trump comments that at the end of the day end up being flip-flopped or [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=71.84s)]
*  walked back. Any sign Wall Street's going to stop engaging in what appears to be a kind of a boy who [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=77.44s)]
*  cried wolf scenario? Yeah, well look, I mean when you have a market that is as sensitive as anytime [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  you even hear progress on talks happening, that's certainly not good for markets because the idea is [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=88.96s)]
*  an investor is you want certainty. You want to know that investment that you're going to make today [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=94.72s)]
*  is going to pay out in a month, going to pay out in a year, going to pay out in 10 years. And the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=97.92s)]
*  problem is that even companies can't forecast what they're going to be making in the quarters [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=101.84s)]
*  coming up because of this tariff uncertainty. They don't know what the policies are going to be, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=105.68s)]
*  let alone in that tomorrow. They don't even know what it's going to be in the next hour. So you [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  have the likes of American Airlines that's pulling their 2025 outlook. PepsiCo announced that they [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=113.2s)]
*  would be cutting their annual profit forecast. So they offered a forecast but said it's going [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  to be lower. United Airlines a few weeks ago saying, you know what, we don't even know what [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=122.4s)]
*  the outcomes are here. Let's have two different scenarios for what our revenue and what our [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  business is going to look like in the coming months. So again, this is not an environment [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=131.60000000000002s)]
*  that's filled with any certainty. Investors are reflecting that. That's the reason why markets [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=135.04s)]
*  remain volatile. Although I want to point out today in early trading for the first 30 minutes, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  at least it seems like things are relatively mixed across markets. It's a quieter Wall Street [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=142.4s)]
*  Day than I'm used to seeing as of the last few weeks. We started the show, things were in the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=146.72s)]
*  green, but as we were just now talking, things have taken a dip, at least in the Dow. So we don't [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  know where things are going to end. Yeah, higher on the S&P, but anything could happen. Well, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  and you talk about how things have been changing day to day or in some cases hour by hour, in some [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=159.04s)]
*  cases, Justin, it could be minute by minute. I just want to recap all the mixed messages [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=164.24s)]
*  on China in the last 24 hours. First, yesterday morning, the treasury secretary said, quote, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=168.88s)]
*  both sides are waiting to speak to the other. Well, then shortly after that, President Trump said this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=174.8s)]
*  Are you talking to them actively now? Actively. Everything's active. Has there been any direct [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=182.72s)]
*  contact between the U.S. and China trade at all? Yeah, of course. And every day. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=188.0s)]
*  Well, then last night, Trump's economic director, he contradicted what we just heard from the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=195.2s)]
*  president. Listen. The president will announce when talks happen, if they happen, but it's clear [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=200.32s)]
*  that the president and our team are open to talks. The Chinese have signaled that they're open to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=208.0s)]
*  talks. Then just this morning, China says any claims about negotiations happening are unfounded. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=214.64s)]
*  Justin, what is the impact of all this? Not just the immediate impact, but longer term, too? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=223.11999999999998s)]
*  Look, it's amazing. I'm an economist. I've been following this closely. And if you asked me where [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=230.0s)]
*  tariff negotiations are between the two great superpowers of the global economy, my answer is [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=235.11999999999998s)]
*  not only do I not know, but different people in the White House are saying different things. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=240.72s)]
*  It makes it impossible. Look, first of all, for businesses, we rely on China for all sorts of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  inputs into our own production. They rely on us as well. It makes it hard for moms and dads at home. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=250.96s)]
*  I was talking to a friend the other day who needs a new air conditioner, and he said, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=258.32s)]
*  should I wait? Well, tariffs are 145 percent. And the president said that's about to change, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=261.36s)]
*  so you should wait. But then the president said that maybe it won't change. And then the press [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=266.32s)]
*  secretary said it definitely won't change. No one knows what's going on, right? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=270.4s)]
*  Exactly. No one knows. But one thing we do know is that there's a lot of uncertainty. There is [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=275.28s)]
*  already some damage being done. People are losing their retirements. Businesses are starting to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  turn away product. President Trump has already admitted 145 percent tariff rate is so high that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  China basically isn't doing business with the U.S. right now. Take a listen. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=297.2s)]
*  I haven't brought it down. I haven't brought it so 145. I haven't brought it down. I said it's a [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  high tariff. It is a high tariff, but I haven't brought it down. It basically means China's not [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=307.84s)]
*  doing any business with us essentially because it's a very high number. So when you add that to the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=312.64s)]
*  price of a product, you know, a lot of those products aren't going to sell. Brian, talk to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=317.44s)]
*  us more about how Americans are already feeling the impact. Well, I mean, I think Justin just hit [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=323.2s)]
*  on it, right? I mean, people that are trying to make decisions like buying an air conditioner [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=327.84s)]
*  or having to watch the White House press conference to see whether or not the policies are such that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=331.2s)]
*  they should try to buy an hour, try to wait. And I think that that is just another layer of uncertainty [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  that is very much similar to what Wall Street and a lot of these C-suite offices are facing as well. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=340.0s)]
*  But I do think to kind of loop back to an earlier question that you had about whether or not markets [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=344.32s)]
*  are willing to engage in this boy who cried wolf game, I do think though that there's a fair point [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  to be made about the tail wagging the dog in this scenario, because yes, it is indeed the case that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=352.8s)]
*  Wall Street has been really, really whipsawing off of what we've been seeing out of Washington, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=357.6s)]
*  D.C. But at the same time, it was the bond markets that appeared to maybe convince the president to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=361.68s)]
*  pare back on those so-called reciprocal tariffs during those discussions a few weeks ago. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=366.16s)]
*  And maybe even suggest that the conversations with the retail executives of Home Depot, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=371.2s)]
*  Target and Walmart earlier this week, maybe convince them to also dial down the rhetoric [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=376.08000000000004s)]
*  specifically on China, given that so many of those retailers source from China. But I do think the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=379.44s)]
*  question here is, can negotiations be had? I think another interesting thread here is that a lot of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=384.16s)]
*  diplomats are in Washington, D.C. right now for those IMF meetings. So it's not that you really [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=389.04s)]
*  even need to get on a plane going all the way to Beijing to have conversations. There are people [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=393.84s)]
*  right up on K Street right now to have those conversations. So the door is open. That's what [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=398.0s)]
*  the Chinese government has said. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said this over and over again. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=402.64s)]
*  The door is open if the U.S. wants to talk. The question is, is the United States, to put this in [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=406.88s)]
*  relationship terms, in the talking stage? We don't know. Well, let's talk to Garrett about who they're [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=411.6s)]
*  talking to, because we heard from the White House press secretary in the last couple of days that [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=416.88s)]
*  there are some 18 written offers or proposals that have been presented. Do we know which countries [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  and how far along they are? I can't say with a cool Australian accent, but I'm going to put, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=428.96s)]
*  no one knows what's going on, mate, on like a sign I can hold up to answer questions like these, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=433.36s)]
*  because the White House is not being forthcoming about that kind of information, perhaps not [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=438.0s)]
*  wanting to raise expectations that they will get 18 trade deals. They're not saying who these [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=442.72s)]
*  countries are who have, they say, submitted these written offers. I think the countries that we know, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=448.32s)]
*  there are serious trade negotiations going on with, really the two big ones are India and Japan. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=453.44s)]
*  Obviously, the vice president was just in India. The president had hosted both leaders of those [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=459.12s)]
*  countries here at the White House before these so-called reciprocal tariffs went into effect. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=464.48s)]
*  And I think that's why those negotiations are at more of an advanced stage than perhaps the other [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=469.36s)]
*  16 to 18 that might have submitted some kind of offer, because there were already discussions [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=474.96s)]
*  happening. Now those discussions take on a greater urgency. But those are really the only two I can [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=480.08s)]
*  point to with any specificity and say, we know that there are specific issues being discussed [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=484.24s)]
*  by the right people to ultimately get to new trade deals. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=489.2s)]
*  Justin, I, speaking of that cool Australian accent, I do want to get some sound in here. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=493.76s)]
*  This is with mega donor Ken Griffin. Here's what he said about Trump's trade actions yesterday. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=500.08s)]
*  The United States was more than just a nation. It's a brand. It's a universal brand. It was like [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=507.2s)]
*  an aspiration for most of the world. And we're eroding that brand right now. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=514.56s)]
*  Justin, we know President Trump cares a lot about branding and image. What's happening to the U.S. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=520.8s)]
*  economic brand right now? Look, let me tell you a story of a young kid growing up in Australia. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=527.6s)]
*  I used to watch a lot of sport. I love sport. And whenever the Olympics are on, if there was [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=534.48s)]
*  an Australian, I'd cheer for the Aussie. But me and all my mates, if there wasn't an Aussie in the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=538.64s)]
*  race, we'd cheer for an American. And this is not just a statement about sports. This is, Ken Griffin [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  was right. It's a statement about aspiration. This was a country that people all around the world [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=549.36s)]
*  looked at and saw opportunity and amazing things going on. And we've lost that. Young Aussie kids [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=554.48s)]
*  don't cheer for the Americans anymore. To give a much starker example, after Trump threatened to [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=561.28s)]
*  take over Canada, he might have thought it was a joke. But if someone threatens to take over your [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=567.28s)]
*  country, it's not funny. They put billions of dollars into defense. Their relationship with [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=572.88s)]
*  the United States is forever wounded. And we can go a step further. Now, one of the things that [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=579.12s)]
*  really makes me angry here is the simple loss of credibility. Nothing that the White House says [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=583.1999999999999s)]
*  one day is true again the next day. Fair enough. It's good TV. But if we have an economic crisis, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=589.68s)]
*  the real problem is we're going to have to rely on a Treasury Secretary being able to walk out and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=595.68s)]
*  say, it's all right, folks. I can calm markets. We've got your back. This is what we're doing. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=599.92s)]
*  But if he's already used up his full quota of lies for the year, he's not going to have that [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=604.64s)]
*  ability. And we're going to be prone to being to all sorts of economic shocks. There's the chaos [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=608.7199999999999s)]
*  happening outside the White House. And now we're learning of some chaos inside as well. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=615.12s)]
*  Garrett, we have this reporting that Elon Musk and Treasury Secretary [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=620.72s)]
*  Besson had a shouting match in the West Wing over who should run the IRS. What can you tell us? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=624.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. This took place about a week ago and happened in a hallway near the Oval Office, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=630.32s)]
*  the two going back and forth about the person who had then been tapped to lead the IRS. The IRS has [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=635.52s)]

*  bit of a hot potato. Besson and Elon Musk disagreeing in that moment. The White House has since [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=645.6800000000001s)]
*  tried to put a positive spin on this, calling the disagreements a normal part of any healthy policy [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=650.88s)]

*  fight and disagree and may the best idea win. And that seems to be the way the White House is [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HMvfyJS7I&t=664.24s)]
