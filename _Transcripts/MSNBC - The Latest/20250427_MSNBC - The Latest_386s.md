# Empty shelves to ‘hit us in waves’ amid trade war: What to expect
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc)
*  New today, consumer sentiment plummeting to one of the lowest levels on record amid a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=0.0s)]
*  fierce trade war. Retailers are warning of empty shelves reminiscent of the pandemic, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=5.48s)]
*  with the 145 percent tariff on nearly all Chinese imports in place. Yesterday, President Trump [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=11.02s)]
*  said he's ready to make a deal with President Xi. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=16.56s)]
*  Have you spoken to him since the tariffs? When did you last speak to him? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  I don't want to comment on that, but I've spoken to him many times. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  When did that happen and what did he do? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=27.479999999999997s)]
*  I'll let you know at the appropriate time. Let's see if we can make a deal. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  Meantime, major ports like the Port of Los Angeles are seeing a steep drop in imports [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=34.48s)]
*  from China. And joining me now, we have Laurie Ann Lerocco, Global Supply Chain reporter for CNBC [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=40.48s)]
*  Business News. Laurie is also the author of the book Trade War, Containers Don't Lie, Navigating [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  the Bluster. Laurie, big welcome to you. So when it comes to the prospect of empty store shelves, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=52.12s)]
*  which products could be hit hardest and should consumers be worried? I mean, are you seeing a [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=58.12s)]
*  rush to buy certain things right now? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=63.12s)]
*  We really shouldn't see a rush because we actually have the items in. It's going to hit us [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=64.12s)]
*  in waves, Alex. And this is what we're going to kind of see with the timeline. Starting in June, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=72.12s)]
*  this is where you're going to start seeing those items that we love to get really cheap online. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=77.56s)]
*  Those are the items that are going to get hit first. And those are like the fast fashion [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=83.56s)]
*  products we might get on Amazon. And the reason why is that smaller businesses, they can't afford [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=88.56s)]
*  to have front loaded, right? All of these items in to beef up their inventory. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=95.56s)]
*  Then starting in July, this is critical because this is the back to school time, right? Where [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=100.56s)]
*  parents are going into the stores to get their kids their school clothes. So you're looking at [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=106.0s)]
*  backpacks. You're looking at notebooks. You're going to be looking at all of these items that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=112.0s)]
*  some have been brought in. But there has been a major pause when you're looking at the amount of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=117.0s)]
*  items that have been brought in. And people are just really uncertain, if you will, is it going to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=124.0s)]
*  consume or going to buy? We have seen the pull back on a multitude of different economic [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=129.0s)]
*  indicators in terms of that hesitancy. And without really any definitive acknowledgement of what's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=134.44s)]
*  going on, we're going to see this pull back. And then in addition to the fast fashion and the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=140.44s)]
*  school clothes, also electronics because of the connectivity, right, of the inventory of the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=145.44s)]
*  supply chain. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=150.44s)]
*  I'm going to get to that in one second. But let me ask, because you're saying basically we have [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=151.44s)]
*  until June that the supply is there as of now. Does that apply to the car industry? Because we [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=155.44s)]
*  reported people are rushing up to buy cars or renew leases or whatever they need to do. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=161.88s)]
*  Yeah, it really depends on the item. And when it comes to the autos, Alex, it's those tariffs that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=165.88s)]
*  have already been slapped. And so people are trying to get in there, right? Let's get that car that's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=173.88s)]
*  out in the lot now before another one has to come in that will be more expensive. So that's why you're [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=179.88s)]
*  seeing that rush for the bigger ticket items. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=185.88s)]
*  OK, so it's about the bottom dollar there. So we learned yesterday that China exempted some U.S.-made [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=189.32s)]
*  microchips from tariffs. Does this indicate that China is backing down on some level? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=195.32s)]
*  I really don't think so, Alex. I mean, it shows that there's a willingness, right, of the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=199.32s)]
*  cooperation. But as we have seen with the prior trade war that's still in existence, there is so much [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=207.32s)]
*  rhetoric. And because of this conflicting comments between Trump and the Chinese officials about if a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=213.76s)]
*  deal is happening, we're going to just continue to be in this push and pause, if you will, of do we [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=221.76s)]
*  make more things? Do we hold off? What do we do? So I'm kind of hesitant to see that this is like a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=227.76s)]
*  victory, if anything, for Trump. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=233.76s)]
*  Well, walk us through what is happening at our West Coast ports. I mean, how much of a drop in [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=236.76s)]
*  shipments from Asia are they experiencing? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=242.2s)]
*  We are seeing a massive, massive drop, Alex. You are looking at a 44% decrease in vessels year over [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=247.2s)]
*  year coming in. And what's really key here, Alex, are the people that move the containers. You need [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=256.2s)]
*  people to move trade. If you have 40% less containers coming in, that is going to impact the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=263.2s)]
*  people that are the truckers, the railroads, the warehousing. This is more than just us consuming [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=270.64s)]
*  and us bringing in orders. There's an entire supply chain here that is connected to jobs. And so the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=277.64s)]
*  longer this goes, Alex, we're going to see some significant impact here in terms of employment. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=284.64s)]
*  In fact, the port of Oakland, which is a huge, huge port that relies on both imports and exports, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=291.64s)]
*  they're very, very balanced. They've got a 50-50 split. They already started warning on Friday about [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=298.08s)]
*  the detriment when it comes to jobs and the exposure with this. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=305.08s)]
*  As you well know, Lorianne, we have seen this week the CEOs of the nation's top retail stores meeting [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=309.08s)]
*  with President Trump and warning the tariffs could no doubt lead to these shortages. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=315.08s)]
*  Even if a deal is reached soon, are we in for at least some troubling times ahead? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=321.08s)]
*  I believe we are. And the reason why is that trade takes time to move and you also have to order it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=328.08s)]
*  The fact that we've had a pause in all of these manufacturing plants, I have had sources tell me in [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=335.08s)]
*  China that there are factories that are literally shut down because they're not making any products [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=341.08s)]
*  for the United States. So if you think about it, remember with COVID, everything shut down and then [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=346.08s)]
*  everything ramped back up. And so what happens is once you hit that unpause button, it's going to be [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=352.52s)]
*  that rush to make the materials and then get the product on the vessels and back here, which causes [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=358.52s)]
*  congestion and raises freight prices. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbPvoxxsDbc&t=363.52s)]
