# ‘Constructed by cartoon villains': House minority whip on Trump’s budget bill
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ)
*  So I look at those numbers and I think to myself, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  how in the world did they win working class voters? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=4.8s)]
*  And what are they going to tell working class voters [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=8.16s)]
*  about their big, beautiful bill come midterms? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=11.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, listen, they won working class voters [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=15.36s)]
*  by saying, we see you, we're gonna work with you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=18.72s)]
*  because we know cost of living is out of reach. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=22.44s)]
*  A recent study said a majority of families, 60%, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=24.96s)]
*  can't afford the basics, housing, groceries, childcare, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  but then they turn around and betray their own voters. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=34.64s)]
*  They betray the people that live in the districts [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=38.12s)]
*  that they represent. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=42.4s)]
*  And what we have is a bill that is almost [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=43.76s)]
*  like it's constructed by cartoon villains [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=47.44s)]
*  because it is taking away healthcare [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=50.54s)]
*  for nearly 14 million Americans. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=53.5s)]
*  It is the biggest cut to food programs [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=56.260000000000005s)]
*  we've ever seen could impact 42 million people. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=59.02s)]
*  And all for what? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=64.54s)]
*  To have a tax cut that is so large [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=66.62s)]
*  for the very, very wealthiest, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=70.22s)]
*  making the winner circle so small in this country. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=72.22s)]
*  And the attic kicker, which you just mentioned, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=76.42s)]
*  and then they put trillions on the credit card [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=80.02000000000001s)]
*  for future generations to pay. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=84.06s)]
*  At a time when Moody's is already bringing down [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=86.02000000000001s)]
*  the current credit score. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=89.86s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=90.7s)]
*  Yeah, I credit what it used to be. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  It isn't what it used to be. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  With this crew in charge. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=95.1s)]
*  And to your point, Representative Clark, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=95.94s)]
*  you've got the Congressional Budget Office [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=97.82s)]
*  analysis of this agenda bill, this big, beautiful bill, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=100.62s)]
*  tells us $267 billion will be spent less [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=104.34s)]
*  in the federal spending for SNAP, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  698 billion less in federal subsidies [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=112.46s)]
*  for Medicaid changes, to your point. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  And to your other point, 2.3 trillion increase [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=117.86s)]
*  in the deficit over 10 years. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=120.98s)]
*  CBO also notes that the increase in the deficit [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=122.58s)]
*  would trigger 500 billion in automatic cuts [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=125.3s)]
*  to Medicare starting next year. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=127.66s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=129.7s)]
*  So the way, folks, the way our system works, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=130.54s)]
*  the way this whole thing is designed [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=133.74s)]
*  is that when Congress acts, and it acts in a way, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=135.46s)]
*  as you know, Simone, having served in the White House, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=138.46s)]
*  when it acts in a way that puts pressure on the system, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=141.44s)]
*  the system will self-correct. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=144.74s)]
*  There are automatic cuts that kick in [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=146.54s)]
*  because those have been in place for a long time. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=149.17999999999998s)]
*  Talk about what that aspect of this, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=151.28s)]
*  which is not focused on a lot. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=153.54s)]
*  No, this- [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=155.22s)]
*  That will also have a major impact. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=156.06s)]
*  You know, this is part of the problem [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=157.7s)]
*  when you have a bill that is created [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  in a solely partisan manner [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=161.34s)]
*  and is being adopted and changed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=163.98s)]
*  We don't even know, as we are talking right now, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=166.73999999999998s)]
*  exactly what we could be voting on tonight [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=170.56s)]
*  because they are still don't have their bill [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=173.38s)]
*  in front of the Rules Committee. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=177.34s)]
*  So we've been meeting since 1 a.m., [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=179.28s)]
*  but we're still operating, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=181.94s)]
*  waiting for our Republican colleagues [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=184.01999999999998s)]
*  to settle their own inner fight [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=186.38s)]
*  and come to us with what their plans are [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=188.94s)]
*  for the American people. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=191.46s)]
*  But what we do know is the president [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=193.22s)]
*  was at the Capitol yesterday, 24 hours ago, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=195.42s)]
*  and said, we will not touch Medicare. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=199.74s)]
*  Half a trillion dollars later, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=202.82s)]
*  we are also about to devastate Medicare. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=205.3s)]
*  So there is nothing that is off limits, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=208.86s)]
*  nothing off limits in order to have these tax cuts. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=212.18s)]
*  And it is, when you add into it the Moody's rating, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=216.54s)]
*  because it is families at home [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=221.82s)]
*  that are gonna have to bear these interest rates, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=223.86s)]
*  and then the tariffs that are put on top of that, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=226.46s)]
*  back to school shopping, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=230.78s)]
*  shopping for young children [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=232.88s)]
*  where the cost of cribs and shoes and clothes and car seats. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=234.74s)]
*  And the things you carry babies in. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=239.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, a stroller for the president. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=240.9s)]
*  Those things are wheels. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=244.9s)]
*  It's just going to go through the roof, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=246.82s)]
*  and we already know people are not making it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=249.34s)]
*  Why are they doing this? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=252.58s)]
*  I just, you know, well, I don't, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=254.98s)]
*  there are very few little things I agree with, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=258.18s)]
*  some of my Republican friends on. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=260.2s)]
*  I think that they're, you know, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=262.0s)]
*  the Republican legislators, they're smart folks. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=263.84s)]
*  This bill feels like a political suicide. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  Just the agenda, we'll put it up on the screen. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=271.36s)]
*  It cuts taxes, but it includes tax hikes on universities, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  on non-citizens, and even some families with children, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  even though the people who are non-citizens, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=279.36s)]
*  they also pay taxes, but they don't take, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=281.32s)]
*  but you know what, nevermind. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=282.68s)]
*  Too deep in the weeds. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=283.64s)]
*  That's too technical. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=284.48s)]
*  Too technical. Come on. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=285.64s)]
*  It scales back Medicaid and SNAP, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=286.64s)]
*  which would make it easier for people to lose coverage [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=289.44s)]
*  with work requirements. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=291.28s)]
*  I will note some of the biggest beneficiaries [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=292.76s)]
*  of SNAP are in rural America. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=294.56s)]
*  It ends clean energy programs, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=296.8s)]
*  which would phase out electric car tax break [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=298.88s)]
*  by the end of 2025. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=300.82s)]
*  That also is, they're going after [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=302.2s)]
*  the Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=304.28s)]
*  which brought a lot of companies. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=308.08s)]
*  I'm thinking about Republicans in upstate New York. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=309.64s)]
*  I thought Micron was coming there to build a plant. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=312.4s)]
*  What's going on with the IRA money? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=314.52s)]
*  It cuts back education programs. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=316.84s)]
*  It limits a Biden-era student loan repayment plan [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  that ties payment to income and household size, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=321.36s)]
*  yet they want people to repay their student loans. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=324.0s)]
*  It increases national security [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=326.04s)]
*  and immigration enforcement spending, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=327.48s)]
*  175 billion for the border control agents. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=329.24s)]
*  I don't see anything in here about addressing [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=332.6s)]
*  the root causes of migration. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  Why are they doing this? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is the plan, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=338.24s)]
*  and they will do anything in order to reward [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  their donor class with tax cuts, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=343.44s)]
*  and they are just, their sole allegiance has become [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  to Donald Trump at the expense of the people they serve. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=351.08s)]
*  And you mentioned a point that so many of these cuts [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=355.04s)]
*  have this outsize impact on women and women who live [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=358.92s)]
*  in rural areas of this country. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=363.76s)]
*  And these tend to be areas [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=366.2s)]
*  that are represented by Republicans. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=369.12s)]

*  and medically underserved communities will close. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=404.42s)]
*  That's two million patients who are not only getting [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECmgohFYxQ&t=408.5s)]
