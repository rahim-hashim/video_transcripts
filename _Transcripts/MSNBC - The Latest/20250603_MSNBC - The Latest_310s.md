# 'This is not a joke': Rep. Swalwell reacts to FEMA head saying he wasn't aware of hurricane season
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ)
*  Joining us now Democratic congressman of California, Eric Swalwell. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  So she's right, of course, in the first term of Donald Trump there were some guardrails [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=4.0s)]
*  in place. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=9.48s)]
*  Those have largely gone away, right? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=10.48s)]
*  So how is this going to play out? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=12.48s)]
*  Is he going to get what he wants? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=15.24s)]
*  Is Doge going to get what he wants? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Well Doge, by the way, is also asking for $60 million more for Doge. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  That math is not math-ing to me because the promise of Doge was that it was going to save [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=24.62s)]
*  us over a trillion dollars and now they're telling us they need money to make more cuts. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=27.74s)]
*  That's like me at 20 calling home from college and saying, Dad, if you send me more money, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=33.1s)]
*  I'll save more money this month. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=37.099999999999994s)]
*  That doesn't add up. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=39.22s)]
*  But who this really hurts, I want to tell you a story. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=40.46s)]
*  I went to the St. Louis suburbs recently and I had a house party of about 100 people and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=42.739999999999995s)]
*  a Republican came and he said he'd never been to a political event in his life, but the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=48.84s)]
*  is that that day, he's a small business owner, runs a health care company, that day that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=53.54s)]
*  he heard about my house party, he had to fire, lay off half of his workforce because USAID [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=59.54s)]
*  had just told him they were not going to pay him the $25 million in services he had already [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=67.18s)]
*  performed. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=72.25999999999999s)]
*  So we look at USAID and Republicans say this is foreign aid. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=73.58s)]
*  Now much of it is spent in the US and it's not just in the DC suburbs. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=77.14s)]
*  It's in places like the St. Louis suburbs. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=80.74s)]
*  So that's the small town effect that this cut is going to have. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=82.74s)]
*  It's an impactful story and it's one that you and most of your Democratic colleagues [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=87.25999999999999s)]
*  have been telling for a while now and yet in that new CNN poll it shows only 16% of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=92.66s)]
*  Americans say Democrats are the party with strong leaders. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=97.97999999999999s)]
*  Just 19% say Democrats can get things done. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=101.5s)]
*  So beyond telling these stories and I think I've certainly heard a lot of them, I've [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=106.22s)]
*  read a lot of them, besides saying Doge is destructive and we're not in the majority, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=111.3s)]
*  what are you going to do to convince those base voters that you are doing something? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=118.06s)]
*  Boldness. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=123.46000000000001s)]
*  People look at Democrats and they see that we had power. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  We had the White House, the Senate and the House, but if you were a mom in America you [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=126.82s)]
*  didn't think your kids were any safer at school from a mass shooting because we didn't pass [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=130.86s)]
*  background checks or an assault weapons ban and we let the filibuster get in the way. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=134.98s)]
*  So we were perceived as being weak when we had power. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=139.01999999999998s)]
*  So with boldness I think we can tell Americans if you're going to bet on yourself, if you're [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=142.01999999999998s)]
*  going to risk everything and work hard, you're going to have a government that will bet on [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=150.26s)]
*  When it comes to your health care, we're not just going to protect it and stop them from [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=151.26s)]
*  taking 14 million people off health care, we're going to double down on cures and investments [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=154.45999999999998s)]
*  to make sure that cures are within reach for everyone. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=160.0s)]
*  So I see an opportunity for boldness and I'm seeing a lot of new leaders emerge. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=162.9s)]
*  Times like these frankly reveal to me not just who should lead but who should leave. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  You're seeing Jasmine Crockett, Maxwell Frost, Robert Garcia, new leaders stepping up, going [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=172.82s)]
*  to town halls and Republican districts and revealing themselves to be able to meet the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=178.3s)]
*  moment and to bring that boldness. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=182.46s)]
*  There is a lot of hope on the Democratic side that all of this is going to start to come [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=184.5s)]
*  to fruition in the midterms, right? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=188.58s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=190.54000000000002s)]
*  We're going to take control of Congress. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=191.54s)]
*  In the meantime though, let's talk about what's happening right now because it's a long time [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=193.14s)]
*  until then and a lot can happen. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  The acting head of FEMA said he was not aware that there was a hurricane season and later [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=199.06s)]
*  they said he was joking. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  Staffers reportedly were left confused. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  They don't know what plan they're following for a hurricane season that has already begun. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=209.5s)]
*  I know you introduced a bill earlier this year to help beef up FEMA's response to natural [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=214.42s)]
*  disasters. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  Do they have what they need right now? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=220.86s)]
*  No. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=222.46s)]
*  I'm the number two Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=223.46s)]
*  This is not a joke. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=225.86s)]
*  It's not a joke if you live in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina where hurricanes have just [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=227.10000000000002s)]
*  ravaged those states. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=231.54000000000002s)]
*  It's not a joke in California where we have suffered from wildfires. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=233.3s)]
*  People in my district and Americans across the country, they work too hard to have unserious [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  individuals in their government. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=243.94s)]
*  They pay too much in taxes to have unserious individuals not take seriously and bring responsible [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=245.38s)]
*  solutions to their communities. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=252.06s)]
*  If that's true, what do you do about it? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=253.06s)]
*  You need a free press that can report on it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=255.26s)]
*  These press reports are important. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=257.34s)]
*  You need town squares to be full of people who care. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=259.36s)]
*  June 14 is no King's Day. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=262.1s)]
*  You're going to see about 2,000 protests across the country. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=263.7s)]
*  You need independent courts that will rule against abuses of power. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=266.5s)]
*  We're seeing all three of those. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=270.38s)]
*  The only one that's missing is a check by Congress. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=271.46s)]
*  That's gone. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=275.82s)]
*  But those three legs, a press, a town square, and the courts, that can hold up our democracy [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=276.82s)]
*  until we get to the midterms. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=281.7s)]
*  You feeling good about the midterms? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=282.7s)]
*  I feel good about the midterms. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=283.7s)]
*  Three seats and we're going to win by way more than that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=284.7s)]
*  Eric Swalwell, thanks for coming in. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=287.18s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=288.5s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=289.5s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=290.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ujNN-HJfQ&t=301.46s)]
