# ‘Complete bloodbath’: DOJ official on Trump admin’s changes to Civil Rights Division
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ)
*  Joining us now, NBC News justice and intelligence correspondent Ken Delaney and MSNBC legal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  analyst and former federal prosecutor Barbara McQuade. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=4.9s)]
*  Ken, what are the changes being made at the DOJ? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=7.92s)]
*  Jose, one of the Justice Department lawyers I spoke to called what's happening a complete [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=11.4s)]
*  bloodbath. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=16.14s)]
*  The Trump administration is changing the basic mission of the Civil Rights Division, the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  way it's operated since it was founded in 1957, to help uphold the voting rights of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  African Americans. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=26.64s)]
*  And this is happening in two main ways. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=27.64s)]
*  One, the DOJ has pushed out nearly all the career civil servants and management positions. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  These are people with decades of experience who have served under Democratic and Republican [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=34.76s)]
*  presidents, including in Trump's first term. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=38.2s)]
*  Many of them were reassigned to jobs unrelated to their expertise. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=40.72s)]
*  And second, the department's leader issued a series of memos last week that essentially [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=43.94s)]
*  abandoned the division's longstanding priorities of enforcing laws prohibiting discrimination [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=47.68s)]
*  against minority groups. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=52.94s)]
*  And instead, the memos say the division will now seek to enforce President Trump's executive [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=54.34s)]
*  orders, many of which focus on, frankly, protecting white Christians. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=58.92s)]
*  Those orders include restoring merit-based opportunity, designated English as the official [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=62.52s)]
*  language of the U.S., and eradicating so-called anti-Christian bias. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=67.4s)]
*  As an example, the division is now investigating whether Los Angeles is improperly withholding [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=71.88000000000001s)]
*  gun permits and has withdrawn several actions around voting rights and taken the opposite [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=76.36s)]
*  position. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=81.4s)]
*  One lawyer told me they have been working there for 18 years and they are now being [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=82.4s)]
*  asked to do the opposite of what they had been doing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=85.62s)]
*  Jose, this did not happen in the first Trump term. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=88.08s)]
*  But as we've learned across a number of fronts, this second term is much different. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=90.8s)]
*  And so, Barbara, legally, the administration has, I guess, the right to do this? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  Or do you see that there are some legal issues involved in these changes? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, to the extent, Jose, that they are enforcing acts of Congress, then they have the ability [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  to do this. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=111.63999999999999s)]
*  But as Ken just said, some of these things are simply executive orders of the president [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=112.63999999999999s)]
*  of questionable legality. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=117.44s)]
*  And so I imagine that some of these actions may be challenged in court. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=119.08s)]
*  To the extent they bring civil complaints or criminal charges, we will see them tested [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  in court. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=128.28s)]
*  I think the thing that's most distressing is that the Civil Rights Division has long [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=129.28s)]
*  been regarded as the crown jewel of the Department of Justice, a place where the Justice Department [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  works to achieve the promise of America. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=138.68s)]
*  And instead, it seems that now this shift has been made to try to send America back [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  to a time before we worked to achieve racial equality in this country. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  And you, I know, worked on civil rights cases during your time at the DOJ. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=151.12s)]
*  How are these changes, you think, going to impact things? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=154.68s)]
*  Well, I think, number one, we're seeing some of the most experienced career lawyers in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=159.44s)]
*  the division being reassigned to lesser responsibilities or leaving on their own, because this isn't [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=165.24s)]
*  the kind of work they signed up for. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=171.32s)]
*  So I think we're going to see a mass exodus of the kinds of very good lawyers that we've [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=173.44s)]
*  come to know at the Civil Rights Division. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=178.52s)]
*  And I worry about who they'll be replaced with. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  The assistant attorney general for civil rights clearly has a very different agenda, and one [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  could expect that she will hire replacements in that mold. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=187.68s)]
*  And then those people will be in that division for decades to come. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=191.32s)]
*  So this could be the kind of thing that cannot simply be unwound with a new election, but [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=195.24s)]
*  may take a generation to resolve. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=199.78s)]
*  Ken, Attorney General Pam Bondi also announced grant cuts to a variety of organizations at [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=202.76s)]
*  the DOJ. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=207.52s)]
*  What do we know about that? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=208.52s)]
*  Yes, Jose, we're told these cuts were recommended by DOJ, and they target groups that provide [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=209.52s)]
*  services to crime victims. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=214.24s)]
*  And Attorney General Bondi has boasted about these cuts on social media, suggesting that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=216.28s)]
*  they took aim at what she views as wasteful spending. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=220.0s)]
*  And she cited gender-affirming care to trans prison inmates as an example. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  But we also learned that Bondi has already reversed some of these cuts, including one [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=226.96s)]
*  program that paid for domestic violence victims to bring their pets to shelters. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=230.6s)]
*  And the National Center for Victims of Crime told us that the DOJ was revoking $2.8 million [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  of its federal grant funding, and they said they would have to close a national hotline [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  called the Victim Connect Resource Center, which helps crime victims to learn about their [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  rights and options. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiMAG9WlUQ&t=248.88s)]
