# Conclave to find new Pope will begin within weeks
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA)
*  From here in Rome to the far-flung reaches of the Catholic Church, much is being written and said about the legacy of Pope Francis, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=0.0s)]
*  his fearlessness in wading into fraught political debates like immigration and war, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=7.0s)]
*  a man who created a church both more open to divorced and LGBTQ Catholics, but closed to the idea of married or women priests. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=12.0s)]
*  It is a complex legacy that frustrated progressives and conservatives alike, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=22.0s)]
*  but also raises the question of how much of what Pope Francis changed will essentially stick. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=26.0s)]
*  And that will be up to his successor. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=33.0s)]
*  Joining me now, Father John Bartunek and NBC News and MSNBC contributor. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=36.0s)]
*  It's good to see you, Father. We've talked in this hour about changes to policy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=41.0s)]
*  We've talked about the book of rights. We've talked about the elevation of so many new cardinals now making up the majority of voting cardinals. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=46.0s)]
*  I wonder in a broader sense, how much of Francis's impact do you think is here to stay? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=54.0s)]
*  It's a great question. You know, it's always a lot of conjecture. We never can really tell the future. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=62.0s)]
*  But I think some of the most important of his contributions are definitely here to stay. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=66.0s)]
*  Let's take, for instance, just a couple of them. One, I think that a lot of people overlook. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=71.0s)]
*  There is what we talk about a lot of clergy about the Francis effect from a point of view of like everyday life [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=76.0s)]
*  of so many Catholics. As soon as Pope Francis became Pope, I remember as a priest being out, being in an airport, being out at a restaurant [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=83.0s)]
*  and people coming up to me who were Catholics but who hadn't practiced their faith for a long time. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=92.0s)]
*  And somehow the pastoral generosity and warmth of Pope Francis made them want to come back and give a second chance to their faith. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=97.0s)]
*  So I think there are so many of those people who have come back to their faith, have rediscovered their faith. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=106.0s)]
*  And that's going to last regardless of who the next Pope is. I think also if you think about it, we have had over 10. Oh, go ahead. Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=112.0s)]
*  No, no, no. Please continue. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=121.0s)]
*  Yeah. So also we've had now over 10 years of a new generation of clergy under Pope Francis. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=124.0s)]
*  The young ones being formed in the seminary, young priests who have begun their ministry. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=131.0s)]
*  And one of Pope Francis's most constant themes was for us as priests, as ministers of the gospel, to put encounter before doctrine. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=137.0s)]
*  Don't get rid of doctrine, but realize that doctrine has to be accepted by a person. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=146.0s)]
*  So he really emphasized, you remember the famous phrase of a shepherd should smell like his sheep. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=152.0s)]
*  We should be out there encountering people, not pre not having a prejudice. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=157.0s)]
*  Encounter everyone. So there's a whole generation of clergy that has kind of absorbed, especially the young seminarians, the young priests have absorbed this as their approach. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=162.0s)]
*  We're going to start with an encounter. We're going to meet people where they're at. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=170.0s)]
*  We're going to bring the gospel to them, show how it's relevant, how it can make a difference. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=173.0s)]
*  So I think that's something else that's not going to change. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=178.0s)]
*  The third thing I would say that doesn't matter who the successor is, the church's conception of itself. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=180.0s)]
*  Pope Francis emphasized so much how universal the church is, the peripheries. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=186.0s)]
*  Everyone is invited to be part of this great adventure of living the gospel. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=192.0s)]
*  And then also the way that he reconstituted the College of Cardinals. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=197.0s)]
*  So this sense that this universal vision, I think that's kind of seeped into the mentality of so many Catholics over the last 10, 12 years. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=201.0s)]
*  And I don't think that's going to change either. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=210.0s)]
*  So I think those are some of the lasting parts of this legacy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=211.0s)]
*  There is a challenge, I think, because American Catholics tend to see the entire church through their own eyes, their own experiences, their own sensibilities, then I think also their own social beliefs. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=216.0s)]
*  Yet they only make up about 6% of the church worldwide. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=228.0s)]
*  As someone who has worked on the Senate of Bishops, somebody who obviously works in a world that is global, I know you spend a lot of time here as well as back in Michigan. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=232.0s)]
*  What do you think American Catholics should know about the global church? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=245.0s)]
*  Well, I think that the most important thing that we all should keep in mind is that we're all called to be missionaries. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=252.0s)]
*  We're all called to be kind of going out to new corners to bring the gospel. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=259.0s)]
*  So American Catholics, we just keep that in mind. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=263.0s)]
*  I think it's going to help put the different pieces in their place. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=266.0s)]
*  Certain pieces are more important than other pieces. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=269.0s)]
*  So there may be differences about what's the best policy for immigration. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=272.0s)]
*  And Pope Francis had no fear about weighing into those policy questions. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=275.0s)]
*  But that's less central than, hey, everybody is actually called to have a friendship with Jesus Christ to discover the meaning that comes from that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=278.0s)]
*  And I think American Catholics, with our American entrepreneurial spirit, to put that at the service of the mission of the church, I think that's going to be one of our greatest contributions to the church throughout the world. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=283.0s)]
*  We're creative thinkers. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=291.0s)]
*  We like to have a sense of what's going on in the church. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=293.0s)]
*  And we put that kind of at the service of this mission, this universal mission of the church. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=296.0s)]
*  I think that's going to help us not get distracted by secondary things and really kind of help the mission go forward in a way that I think Pope Francis was really hoping that it could. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=299.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cI-Xc2VaA&t=326.0s)]
