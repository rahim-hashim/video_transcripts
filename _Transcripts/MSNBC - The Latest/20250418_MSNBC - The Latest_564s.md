# Lost in the sauce: Stories Trump probably hoped you wouldn't notice while he 'flooded the zone'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY)
*  And, you know, there is no shortage of stuff that the Trump administration is doing that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=0.0s)]
*  would be a stop the presses moment in any other administration. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=4.84s)]
*  It's just that he's doing so many of these things at once that they can get lost in the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  sauce, right? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=12.68s)]
*  I mean, Trump just this week has revealed a budget plan that will entirely eliminate [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=13.68s)]
*  the Head Start program everywhere in the country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=18.28s)]
*  This would have been a month's worth of headlines in any other administration. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=21.14s)]
*  I mean, Head Start is preschool, and Trump is going to cut it to zero. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=24.2s)]
*  Nearly 50 percent of all Head Start funding in the whole country goes to rural areas in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=29.44s)]
*  which there often is no other child care option available for young parents. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=34.4s)]
*  Head Start is it, and Trump is zeroing out Head Start. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  Zero. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=43.56s)]
*  He's eliminating it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=44.56s)]
*  This week, Trump has yanked all AmeriCorps volunteers off their projects all across the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  country. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=51.32s)]
*  AmeriCorps is like the Peace Corps, but here at home it sends young people aged 18 to 26 [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=52.32s)]
*  all around the country to do disaster response and conservation projects and education. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=57.36s)]
*  They do things like building housing for veterans. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=63.32s)]
*  They just do good works on a voluntary basis in every state in the country, and they do [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=65.62s)]
*  it in exchange for helping pay for college. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=72.28s)]
*  It is considered to be a 100 percent successful program. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=75.0s)]
*  It is broadly popular and non-controversial with both parties. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=78.6s)]
*  Trump himself supported it and funded it in his first term, but now inexplicably and without [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=82.28s)]
*  warning he has ended all AmeriCorps volunteer assignments right now in the middle of this [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=87.0s)]
*  week, pulled all those people out of what they were doing all over the country, effective [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=92.2s)]
*  immediately, no warning, no explanation. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=96.36s)]
*  And they are cutting virtually all the staff of the agency that oversees the volunteers [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=98.72s)]
*  and make sure the program runs. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=103.72s)]
*  Why is Trump doing that? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=107.3s)]
*  Do you remember Trump running for office saying he was going to kill AmeriCorps, get rid all [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=109.16s)]
*  those kids building housing for veterans? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=113.8s)]
*  Yeah, and we're going to get rid of preschool too. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=116.2s)]
*  Am I right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  I mean, do you remember that from his rallies? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  They were hard to pay attention to. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=123.72s)]
*  They were long, but I don't remember that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=124.92s)]
*  Who's clamoring for this? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=129.44s)]
*  AmeriCorps volunteers are already suing Trump to stop what he's doing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=132.96s)]
*  Now California's governor, Gavin Newsom, says the state of California is going to sue him [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=136.24s)]
*  over this as well. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=140.48s)]
*  We shall see. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=141.48s)]
*  But that's, like I said, one among many. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=143.72s)]
*  Trump has now fired so many people at the National Weather Service that the agency yesterday [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=145.8s)]
*  sent out a blanket notice advising their staff that they're going to need to reduce or suspend [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=150.04s)]
*  weather balloon launches all over the country. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=156.12s)]
*  Weather balloon launches make weather forecasts accurate. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=158.88s)]
*  The former administrator of NOAA tells USA Today that that factor and the staff shortages [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  imposed by Trump are already degrading our weather forecasts in this country. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=168.64s)]
*  Washington Post reports that the number of meteorologists on staff at some local forecast [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  offices is now half their normal staffing or less in multiple locations, and that is [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  permanent and likely to get worse with what else Trump has in store for the National Weather [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=183.48s)]
*  Service and NOAA. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=188.0s)]
*  Quote, as severe storm season ramps up, it's the offices in places such as Kansas City, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=190.0s)]
*  Omaha, Louisville, Des Moines and Grand Rapids that are facing the most significant staffing [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=195.2s)]
*  shortages. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=201.2s)]
*  And on top of that, to stop people who work in these agencies from letting the press and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  the public know about what Trump is doing to the Weather Service, to stop people from [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=208.32s)]
*  talking about how their weather forecasts are degrading because of what Trump is doing [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=212.29999999999998s)]
*  to the Weather Service, the Washington Post reports that the Trump administration is now, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  installing monitoring software on NOAA employees' devices to track their communications so they [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=222.56s)]
*  can make sure they're not talking to the public and not talking to the press about [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=230.24s)]
*  the way Trump is decimating the Weather Service. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=233.84s)]
*  Yesterday the Trump administration tried to force through a basically total reduction [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=242.12s)]
*  at the CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=249.08s)]
*  It would have effectively fired the entire staff of the agency. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=252.8s)]
*  The staff of that agency, I will tell you, is feisty as heck. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=256.04s)]
*  They got the firing notices yesterday afternoon. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  They were all supposed to be fired as of 6 o'clock tonight, but they figured out a way [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=263.52000000000004s)]
*  to get themselves in front of a federal judge this morning before today's 6 p.m. deadline, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  and that judge this morning blocked the firings. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=272.32s)]
*  The judge, quote, told attorneys for the government she was deeply concerned about the apparently [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=274.91999999999996s)]
*  rushed efforts to implement a reduction in force of approximately 1,500 employees at [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=279.56s)]
*  the CFPB, which was set to take effect at 6 p.m. tonight. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  The judge said the move by the Trump administration could be in direct violation of an injunction [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  she had put in place already. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=293.41999999999996s)]
*  That injunction required terminations at the agency to be carried out only after a particularized [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=295.2s)]
*  assessment of individual employees' performance. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=301.12s)]
*  Judge told attorneys from the Trump administration that this reduction in force thing that they [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=306.64s)]
*  tried to force through today, quote, is not going to happen in the meantime. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=310.96s)]
*  The judge ordered the Trump administration to advise agency leadership that they need [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=315.4s)]
*  to make that clear to employees who had been informed they would be ousted. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  In other words, the judge is telling CFPB, not only are you not firing those people today, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=325.4s)]
*  but you are going to tell them that they are not being fired because they all got notices [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=330.84s)]
*  from you saying they're fired as of today. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=334.84s)]
*  You must notify them that they are not being fired. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=337.02s)]
*  ABC News reports, quote, many of those employees sat in her courtroom Friday and several broke [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  into tears following the hearing. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=346.73999999999995s)]
*  The judge in this case has also set a hearing for a week and a half from now, April 28th. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=353.0s)]
*  She says she wants testimony from at least one Trump administration official and potentially [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=358.92s)]
*  one member of DOJ about what they tried to do here with trying to fire the whole agency. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=363.32s)]
*  She says she's basically going to get to the bottom of whether they violated her court [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=368.88s)]
*  order with this attempt to fire these people, which again, they did not get away with, which [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=372.12s)]
*  she blocked and which they now have to answer for as potentially having violated a lawful [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=376.92s)]
*  court order. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=382.52s)]
*  Like I said, those CFPB employees are feisty. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=385.24s)]
*  Every time there's a court hearing, they are filling the gallery. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=388.20000000000005s)]
*  Every time there is anything going on with their agency, every single thing that they [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=391.12s)]
*  have tried to shiv that agency with, they have not only fought back, but they have shown [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=394.92s)]
*  up in person. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=398.76000000000005s)]
*  And it matters and it is working and they are still there hanging on. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=400.72s)]
*  There is no shortage of fight in no shortage of people for no shortage of things that Trump [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=407.36s)]
*  is doing. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=412.92s)]
*  One issue in particular keeps rising to the top, and it's because of the extremism of [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=416.16s)]
*  what Trump is doing specifically to immigrants. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  And it is just lighting up the country right now. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=425.0s)]
*  We've been covering this all this week in particular, but it really is every day. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  In Washtenaw County, Michigan this week, local residents packed into a county commissioners [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  meeting. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=437.52000000000004s)]
*  They filled up the room. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=438.52000000000004s)]
*  They filled up the overflow room. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=439.52000000000004s)]
*  They filled up the hallway outside of both. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=440.68s)]
*  The county commissioners met after the Trump administration threatened that county and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  demanded that that county needed to effectively inform to the Trump administration on local [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  residents and even on county employees, presumably so people could be targeted by Trump's immigration [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=453.84s)]
*  agents. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=460.04s)]
*  The county is showing no signs of budging on that and the community is backing them [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=461.04s)]
*  up on it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=465.48s)]
*  They packed this hearing. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=466.48s)]
*  You can see this headline in the local news and M-Live here, quote, residents make emotional [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=467.96s)]
*  As feds demand information, residents packed a meeting of Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=472.76s)]
*  to express support for the immigrant community. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=477.84s)]
*  Quote, we do not want you to cave from the pressure you are under. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=480.44s)]
*  This video, you will remember this video. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qj3I5HopNY&t=489.76s)]
