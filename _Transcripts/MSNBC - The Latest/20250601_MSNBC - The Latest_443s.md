# Kash Patel is ‘politicizing’ FBI and making agents ‘afraid of their own work’: Rep. Dean
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M)
*  New today, a New York Times report reveals upheaval in the FBI under director Cash Patel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=0.0s)]
*  amid his efforts to mold the bureau into the worldview of President Trump and his allies. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=5.8s)]
*  The article says agents have been forced out, others demoted with no explanation, diminishing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=10.88s)]
*  decades of national security experience. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=16.44s)]
*  The Times also reports Patel is freely using polygraph tests to hunt down sources of news [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=19.36s)]
*  leaks and promises to relaunch investigations into some of Trump's political adversaries. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=25.5s)]
*  Take a listen to my next guest questioning Patel at a recent House hearing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=31.54s)]
*  I am gravely concerned about the utter lack of independence of the FBI and its weaponization [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  under your leadership. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=42.94s)]
*  I am concerned that the president is using this book, your book, as a blueprint, as he [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  has said. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  It's a blueprint for revenge. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  When can I, a former impeachment manager, expect the FBI at my door? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=53.68s)]
*  Ma'am, you want to know who was targeted by a weaponized FBI? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=58.36s)]
*  Me. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=62.92s)]
*  You want to know how and why? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=64.16s)]
*  You want to know what I'm doing to fix it? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=65.16s)]
*  Well, you may need to write a book about that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=67.16s)]
*  Joining me now is Pennsylvania Congresswoman Madeline Dean. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=69.16s)]
*  She is on the Appropriations and Foreign Affairs committees. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=71.8s)]
*  Welcome, Congressman. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=74.76s)]
*  Always good to see you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=75.76s)]
*  And look, you have cited concerns detailed in this report. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=76.76s)]
*  Bank and File are describing a culture of fear and uncertainty. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=81.28s)]
*  They're wondering if they're going to be ousted over ties, either to the previous administration [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=83.92s)]
*  or for having worked on an investigation now seen as unfavorable to Trump. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=87.88s)]
*  But increasing polygraph tests on employees and agents to go after leaks? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=92.56s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=97.12s)]
*  Well, I'm gravely disappointed that Kash Patel is running the FBI. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=98.72s)]
*  I'm gravely disappointed that he was Senate-confirmed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=103.72s)]
*  And that's why I asked some of the questions I did when he was in front of us for the Appropriations [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=107.92s)]
*  Committee. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=112.92s)]
*  After all, the mission of the FBI is to keep the American people safe and to abide by the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=113.92s)]
*  Constitution. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=120.32s)]
*  This man is wholly unqualified to run the FBI, and this recent reporting shows it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=121.84s)]
*  I did point out that what seems to have qualified him for this president, for this would-be [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=128.44s)]
*  emperor, is that he wrote the book, Government Gangsters, in it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=134.28s)]
*  He has all kinds of names of people that Donald Trump would like to seek revenge on. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  And so that, and he also wrote a children's book. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=145.76s)]
*  I don't know if anybody saw it, but it's called The Plot Against the King. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=148.68s)]
*  How cute, how pathetic, that to gain favor with this would-be king, Kash Patel writes [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=152.6s)]
*  these books and goes on podcasts and just attracts the far right, conspiracy theories [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=160.44s)]
*  and all. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  What this reporting shows is what worries me a lot, and that is we have really amazing [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  people who work at the FBI, many who have worked for decades. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  Thirty-eight thousand folks work at the FBI. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=177.8s)]
*  They're not there as a political arm. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=181.0s)]
*  In fact, they are not to be political at all. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=182.8s)]
*  And what this FBI director is doing is politicizing and also making people afraid of their own [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=186.36s)]
*  work. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  He's shifting or getting rid of top agents, field directors. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  He's telling others, take this transfer or you will be demoted. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=198.56s)]
*  And he's flat out firing others. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=202.96s)]
*  I've worked with the FBI over the past six and a half years as a member of Congress, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=205.56s)]
*  whether on judiciary or foreign affairs or appropriations now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=211.08s)]
*  They are some of the most dedicated public servants. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=215.2s)]
*  They're not political animals. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  And this use of polygraphs against them is really concerning. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=219.88s)]
*  Patel said that the agency is going to revisit past investigations, including the 2022 leak [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  of a draft Supreme Court opinion on abortion, cocaine that was found two years ago at the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=230.28s)]
*  White House. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=235.12s)]
*  He said that he's going to soon announce a definitive answer as to whether there were [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=236.12s)]
*  FBI sources present at the January 6th insurrection, despite the DOJ saying there were. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  Part three FBI confidential sources there that day. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=245.12s)]
*  Why reopen these probes? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=248.36s)]
*  What do you think he's going to find? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=250.44s)]
*  Well, and he's reopening a couple of probes that were not within his jurisdiction at all. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=252.32s)]
*  The leak of the Dobbs decision, for example, that was investigated by the proper authorities [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=258.44s)]
*  within the Supreme Court. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=263.0s)]
*  What he's looking at, the cocaine in the White House during the last administration found, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  I don't know why he's going after these, except we do know that his principle, that Donald [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=271.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump is hell bent on revenge, on smearing other people. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=277.0s)]
*  I don't understand it, Alex. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=282.44000000000005s)]
*  I really want to tell you that I do not understand it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=283.92s)]
*  I thought when this president was sworn in for a second term, he would say, OK, I won [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=286.8s)]
*  this time and I'm going to try to do my very best for the American people. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  We have seen nothing to show evidence of that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  He's interested only in revenge. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=299.88s)]
*  He's interested only in protecting and gaining for himself and his family. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=302.12s)]
*  And you know what really worries me is what we're not talking about. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=307.88s)]
*  We're not talking about this president leading in peace in the Middle East, getting the hostages [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=311.7s)]
*  home and getting aid into starving Gaza. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=317.0s)]
*  We are not talking about peace in Ukraine and saving lives there. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=321.48s)]
*  That's the thing he was going to answer and complete on day one. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=326.56s)]
*  We are not talking about the people dying every single day as a result of the shuttering [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=329.96s)]
*  of USAID. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=335.96s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the estimates, but a Boston University economist has a dashboard [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=336.96s)]
*  going 103 people an hour are dying, 2500 people a day around the globe because of our failure [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=342.96s)]
*  to pay attention, keep the eye on the ball of other countries who are struggling, suffering, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=352.84s)]
*  starving or at war. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=358.12s)]
*  That was a lot to take in and I'm still digesting it all. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=360.12s)]
*  But yeah, let me ask you one last question, though. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=364.28s)]
*  It's relative to Elon Musk, who officially stepped down from his role as a special government [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=368.24s)]
*  employee. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  He's left a trail of upheaval across government agencies. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  He also racked up significant personal benefits, and that would include new lucrative government [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=376.32s)]
*  contracts for SpaceX. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=381.68s)]
*  He hopes to continue to be a friend and advisor to the president. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=384.12s)]
*  That's a quote. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=387.16s)]
*  What legacy does Musk leave behind as a political operator? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=388.16s)]
*  And do you expect Doge to carry on his work with the same fervor in his absence? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=392.0s)]
*  I do need a quick answer. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=396.72s)]
*  I'm sorry for this. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=397.72s)]
*  A fiasco, just an utter fiasco, harmful to the administration, harmful to our country. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=398.72s)]
*  He went in with a shiny chainsaw and it's funny, strange. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=405.12s)]
*  He goes out with a shiner. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=408.76s)]
*  I think it's a metaphor for the black eye that his brief time in office will leave on [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=410.4s)]
*  this administration. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=416.24s)]
*  Okay, Madeline Dean, it's always good to speak with you. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=417.24s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  You gave us a lot to think about, too. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=422.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrnP1dkK8M&t=440.32s)]
