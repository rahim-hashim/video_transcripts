# ‘He’s totally blown it’: Strategists react as Trump's approvals rating tanks ahead of 100-day mark
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg)
*  Just shy of about 100 days back in office, Donald Trump isn't exactly convincing Americans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=0.0s)]
*  he's up for the job. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=7.08s)]
*  There's a brand new AP poll and it finds just 18 percent, 18 percent of Americans think [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=8.08s)]
*  that he's been a great president so far. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=13.56s)]
*  13 percent say he's good. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=16.12s)]
*  The same amount rank his performance as poor and nearly four out of ten say he's a terrible [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=18.52s)]
*  president. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=23.72s)]
*  His tanking approval ratings come as voters absorb the high cost of his tariffs and witness [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=24.72s)]
*  massive cuts to the federal workforce, not to mention his attacks on the rule of law. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=29.58s)]
*  According to a Fox poll, just 44 percent of voters approve of the job that he's doing. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=34.62s)]
*  And that's the worst approval rating in that poll at this point in a presidency this century. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=40.18s)]
*  It hits well below the numbers of President Biden, Obama, and George W. Bush during their [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=45.86s)]
*  first 100 days. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=50.3s)]
*  It is even one point worse than his approval at the 100-day mark of his first term. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=51.3s)]
*  Now, you know, we like to say about polls, it's just a snapshot in time, but this, and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=57.46s)]
*  you know, they're indicative of how voters are feeling right now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=63.02s)]
*  They're not a crystal ball, but oh goodness, the voters are not feeling confident. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  They're not feeling confident. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=71.1s)]
*  I don't know how much I want to put into this right now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=72.1s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=76.22s)]
*  You know, it's simply, this hasn't settled out yet and I just wish people stop acting [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=77.22s)]
*  like it has. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=83.58s)]
*  Something that has occurred in the first quarter of this year is not going to be felt until [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=86.06s)]
*  the end of the second quarter of this year, meaning when we get into late May and June, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=90.22s)]
*  you'll start to see the full impact of the trade war because that's the reality. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=95.9s)]
*  So these numbers, maybe they are precursor, maybe, and you know, that's something that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  we can get into a little bit more, that they're kind of setting up a narrative to come. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=104.34s)]
*  So you know, I just don't want to overshoot the moon here with this idea that somehow, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=109.74000000000001s)]
*  oh my God, look at this, he's 13% of the people like him. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=114.94s)]
*  Slow your roll on this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=119.34s)]
*  There's still a lot more that Donald Trump has that he can do to make those numbers worse [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=120.94s)]
*  or he can actually turn the corner a little bit and have those numbers tick up. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  Here's what I think is interesting about those numbers, which is we talk a lot about the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=132.82s)]
*  incompetency of this administration where they have been very competent and very effective [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=137.1s)]
*  is in swiftly implementing some of the elements of project 2025, particularly when it comes [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=142.02s)]
*  to deconstruction of the administrative state to use their language, not mine. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=146.9s)]
*  If that is not what people voted for, that is what they have gotten in the first hundred [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=152.1s)]
*  days that has been the priority. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=156.62s)]
*  And so I think some of what you're seeing is a response to where this administration [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=158.26s)]
*  has put their time, their efforts and their energies. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=162.66s)]
*  You know, the numbers that I'm really interested in looking at numbers, but also, you know, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=165.02s)]
*  I love a focus group. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=168.62s)]
*  These polls could tell you anything of the sample size, but I want to know what the focus [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=170.14s)]
*  groups say, particularly focus groups of Trump voters, maybe Biden Trump voters, right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  People who voted for President Biden in 2020, voted for Trump in 24. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=180.5s)]
*  And I say that because those are the folks that if they are saying, okay, we don't really [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=184.98s)]
*  like how what we're getting from Donald Trump, I think that's a bigger indicator that folks [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=190.17999999999998s)]
*  are turning on him. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=195.85999999999999s)]
*  Right now, I think we see that the people that did vote for him don't like him. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=197.73999999999998s)]
*  Some of the people that voted for him don't like the economy, but maybe they still think [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=202.5s)]
*  he's good or giving him the benefit of the doubt. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=206.94s)]
*  So it remains to be seen, folks. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=209.26s)]
*  We can get into it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=211.33999999999997s)]
*  Joining us now is MSNBC senior contributing editor, Michel Norris, and MSNBC political [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=212.66s)]
*  analyst Brendan Buck. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=218.06s)]
*  He served as press secretary, advisor, all of the things, a comp's guru, if you will, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=219.73999999999998s)]
*  to former House Speaker John Boehner. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=224.14s)]
*  You know, I want to start with you, Brendan, because I want to pick up on the point that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=226.9s)]
*  I was just making that I think there's this tendency where numbers come out initially [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=230.18s)]
*  and they're really bad for any president. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=235.70000000000002s)]
*  But you know, especially for someone like Trump, everybody wants to jump on him and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=237.66000000000003s)]
*  say, oh my God, yes, finally, you know, people don't like him. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=241.3s)]
*  I'm a little bit like, okay, I understand. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=245.34s)]
*  But there are things that he can do. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=248.3s)]
*  So we've already seen that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=251.26s)]
*  If he eases the gas, off the gas, on trades, that changes the dynamic on Wall Street and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=253.06s)]
*  Main Street, and people's attitudes could shift. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=258.7s)]
*  I still think that spaked into this that has not been realized yet is the damage that's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=261.46s)]
*  already been done with the firing of a lot of federal employees who manage a lot of the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=266.78s)]
*  nation's business. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=271.3s)]
*  That's going to come home soon. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=273.46s)]
*  But what's your take on how we sort of frame this initial policy? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=275.02s)]
*  Well, I certainly agree with you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=279.17999999999995s)]
*  Obviously, it's just a snapshot, but I certainly don't think it's going to get better for him [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=280.17999999999995s)]
*  anytime soon. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=283.06s)]
*  I mean, this is a president who absolutely believes in what he's doing. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=284.06s)]
*  And they throw around this word mandate a lot. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=286.82s)]
*  They think they had a mandate to come in. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=289.26s)]
*  I'm not actually, I don't know that they actually did have a mandate to do that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=290.82s)]
*  And every president says that they have a mandate. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=294.09999999999997s)]
*  If he had a mandate to do anything, it was to address the cost of living. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=295.7s)]
*  And he's certainly not doing that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=299.26s)]
*  I think what's amazing in all of this polling is how much he has undermined the advantages [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=301.9s)]
*  he had going in. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=305.76s)]
*  He had a real advantage on the issue of immigration. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=306.8s)]
*  Now he's underwater on immigration? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=309.08s)]
*  That's remarkable. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=311.2s)]
*  And, of course, on the economy, this economy was ready to get going. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=312.2s)]
*  It was going to be roaring. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=316.8s)]
*  If he had just gotten out of the way a little bit, they were going to extend the tax law, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=317.8s)]
*  just keep things humming, especially in contrast to what we had been through under Joe Biden. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=321.84s)]
*  Just stay out of the way. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=326.24s)]
*  You would have been fine. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=327.24s)]
*  And he's totally blown it, to your point. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=328.24s)]
*  Tariffs are just getting started. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=330.4s)]
*  This is only going to get worse. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=331.4s)]
*  If anything is going to sort of check him, the guardrails are public opinion, so maybe [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=333.44s)]
*  he'll see some of this and realize that he shouldn't go forward. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=337.36s)]
*  But he's not shown himself to be somebody who... [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=341.04s)]
*  Recalibrates. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=344.28s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=345.28s)]
*  If there's anything that we know, he believes in the tariffs, so it's not like he's just [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=346.28s)]
*  going to completely abandon this concept. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=349.64s)]
*  And as long as he keeps even just flirting with it, markets are not going to be happy [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  and he's going to pay the price. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=354.88s)]
*  Markets are not going to be happy and consumers are not going to be happy. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=356.08s)]
*  Michelle Norris, The Wall Street Journal, had a piece out about consumer sentiment the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=359.04s)]
*  way that Americans as consumers are looking at this economy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=363.16s)]
*  This is what they write. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=366.56s)]
*  American households ended April feeling much worse about the economy than they did in March, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=367.56s)]
*  according to a closely watched measure of consumer sentiment. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=372.16s)]
*  The Michigan survey said people expect weaker income growth for themselves in the year ahead, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=375.1s)]
*  slower consumer spending can turn a gloomy mood into a real economic slowdown. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=379.76s)]
*  If they had come in, Michelle, and focused on the economy as they had promised voters [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=384.92s)]
*  in their first hundred days, I have to imagine these numbers would be in a different place. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=389.48s)]
*  Oh, they'd absolutely be in a different place. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, what you're seeing now is consumer malaise across the board. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=396.0s)]
*  And you know, you were saying earlier that Donald Trump doesn't necessarily recalibrate. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=402.08s)]
*  He does sort of backtrack on some of his steps. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  And even if he tried to do that on the tariffs right now, it's too late. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=410.2s)]
*  I mean, there are boats that should be on the water with goods that should be on their [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=413.76s)]
*  way to the United States. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=417.8s)]
*  And at this point, they're not going to get here in time. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=418.8s)]
*  And so we're really going to see in the second and third quarter, you might not see empty [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=421.08s)]
*  shelves, but you're going to see shortages. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=425.08s)]
*  And that's really going to affect people. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=426.6s)]
*  And part of the problem is there's there's the sentiment about the government and the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=427.96000000000004s)]
*  sentiment about the economy. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=431.92s)]
*  It's possible that the sentiment about the government could turn around if they started [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=433.16s)]
*  to communicate a little bit differently, if they started to bring back some of the federal [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=437.44s)]
*  workers that they had fired. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=440.56s)]
*  But in terms of the economy, I mean, the past shows that when you see this kind of consumer [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  sediment drop, this kind of malaise, there's a hangover effect. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=447.08000000000004s)]
*  And it takes a long time for that to bounce back. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=450.76000000000005s)]
*  And it's just not going to happen if people are still feeling it in their wallets. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=457.56s)]
*  I mean, NBC has a story about product shortages from Shannon Pettypiece. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=458.56s)]
*  And they write, companies have been canceling their shipments of goods from China and halting [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  new orders. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  Typically, U.S. retailers will be ramping up their orders for two critical periods later [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  this year, the fallback to school shopping season and the winter holidays. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=476.24s)]
*  And the pullback is creating uncertainty about whether U.S. shoppers will have the selection [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=480.64s)]
*  of goods they've grown accustomed to in the coming months. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=485.0s)]
*  This is the point Michelle was just making, that the containers are empty. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=487.64s)]
*  I mean, we had Congressman Robert Garcia on a couple of weeks ago, and he represents the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=492.12s)]
*  Long Beach area. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=497.68s)]
*  He is formerly the mayor of Long Beach. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=498.68s)]
*  And he's been talking to the shipping container folks, and they're like, baby, what is going [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=500.84s)]
*  on? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=504.59999999999997s)]
*  They are appealing to the administration because their business is hurting. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=505.64000000000004s)]
*  And when we talk about the business is hurting, it always trickles down to the people, to [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=510.44s)]
*  the workers, to the consumers. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=514.28s)]
*  I mean, and the president will come out with all of the talking points he wants, but empty [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=516.0s)]
*  shelves. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=519.8000000000001s)]
*  The economy's great. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  Empty shelves are going to trouble any talking point that they have. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=521.8000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, and again, I don't know that anybody signed up for any of the stuff that [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=525.24s)]
*  the president is talking about. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=528.12s)]
*  Even tariffs were at one point popular, and he has now made them extremely unpopular. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=530.72s)]
*  But we haven't even felt the impacts of this yet. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=535.12s)]
*  And I don't know that they have a whole lot to answer. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=538.88s)]
*  I don't know that people can trust the president after this on the economy, but they also don't [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=540.28s)]
*  have like a next phase. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=544.92s)]
*  Obviously, they're talking about a large tax bill that they're going to move through Congress. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=546.16s)]
*  Here's a little secret about that tax bill. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=550.2s)]
*  I'm really proud of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to help pass it the first time around. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=551.76s)]
*  All they're talking about doing is keeping tax rates exactly where they are today. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=555.24s)]
*  That's not going to boost the economy anything. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=558.6s)]
*  I don't know how that's going to create some kind of turnaround. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=560.8s)]
*  So, you know, what exactly are they going to do to fight back on the tariffs? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=564.0s)]
*  And that's been their message is just hold on a second. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=566.84s)]
*  We're going to have the tax bill. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=568.72s)]
*  The tax bill isn't cutting taxes for most people. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=569.72s)]
*  It's just keeping them the same. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=571.84s)]
*  It's just keeping them the same. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=572.84s)]
*  So that raises an interesting point, Michelle, that I found in the headline, voters warn [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=573.84s)]
*  Trump MAGA, but not like this, noting, you know, you just can't make it up, right? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=581.88s)]
*  In less than 100 days, President Trump has squandered his polling strength on the two [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=589.56s)]
*  issues most fundamental to his reelection, the economy and immigration. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=593.5999999999999s)]
*  That's a major red flag for a president whose chaotic style is only tolerated when it delivers [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=597.9599999999999s)]
*  results. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=603.5999999999999s)]
*  So to the points that Brendan has already made about the economy, when you now layer [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=604.5999999999999s)]
*  into that mix, the immigration piece, yes, they're watching people get snatched off the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=611.16s)]
*  streets and folks are applauding that. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=618.76s)]
*  Yes, crackdown on immigration. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=621.4s)]
*  But there are other sides to this story that are also emerging that are showing a very [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=624.36s)]
*  dark side to this policy that I'm curious how that resonates. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=629.12s)]
*  We get the economy. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=633.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, my my cupboards are bare and my bank account is low. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=634.8000000000001s)]
*  But then what what happens? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=639.14s)]
*  Do you think with that other piece, is that a salvageable piece, a salvageable piece for [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=640.88s)]
*  Trump? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=644.96s)]
*  Or does that, too, hit the public in a way in which it just doubles down on the numbers [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=645.96s)]
*  that Brendan was talking about? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=650.96s)]
*  Well, one of his strengths has always been that he's been able to make he's used these [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=652.4000000000001s)]
*  cultural wedges in a very effective way. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=656.44s)]
*  You know, when he talks about making America great again, we all know what that means. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, it means going back to a time where certain people felt like they had certain [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=663.9200000000001s)]
*  privileges and they had an easy pass through life. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=668.1600000000001s)]
*  And yes, that does make you feel good, but it doesn't necessarily put gas in your tank. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=671.96s)]
*  It doesn't lower the price of eggs. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=676.82s)]
*  And so you see these two things sort of clashing, you know, the cultural wars that they still [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=678.44s)]
*  use to try to gin up support. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=683.1600000000001s)]
*  But at the same time, they've undermined their ability to do that effectively because [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=685.64s)]
*  of the economy. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=689.74s)]
*  And even on the immigration issue, where they normally have strong support, you're starting [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=691.36s)]
*  to see some softening in those numbers also. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=696.72s)]
*  And I will give the Democrats some credit here in creating a narrative that has become [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=699.16s)]
*  rather effective in showing that this is not just about Abrego Garcia. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=704.8s)]
*  This is a much bigger issue, that he represents a threat to the rule of law in America. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=710.06s)]
*  And if this could happen to you, I mean, the video that really stands with me is when the [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=715.68s)]
*  building trades union head stood up and said, this is one of our brothers and a room full [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=720.1999999999999s)]
*  of men, largely white men, men in suits, are standing up and applauding and chanting, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=725.58s)]
*  bring him home. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=731.1800000000001s)]
*  So this is an issue that's softened for Donald Trump as well. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=732.34s)]
*  And I agree with Brendan. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=735.82s)]
*  The image of empty shelves, you know, when you start seeing that on the front page of [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=737.5s)]
*  the newspaper, when you start, you pick up your device and you see that and you're scrolling [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=742.4200000000001s)]
*  through Tic Tac or Instagram, wherever you are, and you're seeing town after town with [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=745.9000000000001s)]
*  these empty shelves, that is a durable image. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=749.4200000000001s)]
*  That is the kind of image that is like a breadline image in, you know, during the Depression [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=752.3399999999999s)]
*  in 1931. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=756.54s)]
*  It's going to be really hard for them to come back with that. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=758.04s)]
*  And then when that happens, the currency around these cultural wedge issues perhaps is not [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=761.26s)]
*  as strong as it was before. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=767.16s)]
*  Because what they're doing is they're giving people a sense of strength. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=769.18s)]
*  And that may make you feel good, the idea that I'm better than that guy down the road [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=771.9799999999999s)]
*  or I'm better than that group of people. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=775.2199999999999s)]
*  But that doesn't help you feed your kids. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFJyySQvLg&t=777.78s)]
