# ‘Going to make the deficit so much worse’: Ex-GOP advisor explains ‘irony’ of Trump’s megabill
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg)
*  NBC's Melanie Zanona reports from Capitol Hill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=0.0s)]
*  Also with me, former adviser to George W. Bush and John McCain and creator of the circus, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=3.58s)]
*  Mark McKinnon. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=8.16s)]
*  So, Melanie, I want to start on what we just heard there from the president, that this [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=9.16s)]
*  would be the biggest tax cut in history and the alternative is a massive 68 percent tax [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=13.06s)]
*  increase. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  What's he talking about there? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, President Trump really trying to lay out the stakes for House Republicans here [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=22.94s)]
*  as GOP leadership races to pass this bill before the Memorial Day next weekend. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=26.82s)]
*  And what Trump is referring to here is that at the center of this package is a permanent [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=32.3s)]
*  extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which is why he said if they do not act, if they [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=37.3s)]
*  let that law expire, there's going to be a tax increase. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=42.6s)]
*  And the bill also includes a number of other tax priorities, things that Trump campaigned [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  on such as no tax on tips. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=49.58s)]
*  He talked about that in the meeting as well. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  However, there are still a number of unresolved issues, including how much to cut Medicaid, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=53.98s)]
*  how much to cap the state and local tax deduction. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=59.14s)]
*  These are huge, sticky issues that are threatening to derail the entire process, which is why [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=62.06s)]
*  the GOP leadership decided to bring in the big guns, bring in the reinforcements today [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=66.62s)]
*  in the form of Donald Trump. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=70.92s)]
*  And his message to Republicans, according to multiple sources in the room, was it's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=72.58s)]
*  time to put the pens down, it's time to stop negotiating and time to get this done. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=76.46s)]
*  Let's take a listen to what GOP leadership had to say about today's meeting. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=81.96s)]
*  And if Republicans don't fall in line, Trump also warned that perhaps some of these members [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=111.96s)]
*  could face primary threats. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  So while this meeting was mostly described as a pep rally, I think Trump even said at [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=124.8s)]
*  one point that it was a meeting of love, there was a little arm twisting as well. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=129.04s)]
*  OK, so Mark, here's what the president had to say right after the meeting. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=132.56s)]
*  That was love in that room. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=141.96s)]
*  There was no shouting. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=143.16s)]
*  I think it was a meeting of love. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=145.6s)]
*  Kumbaya, Mark, we have seen time and time again Trump move Republicans basically en masse [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  by saying the time for talk is over. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=153.56s)]
*  But with the concerns around this bill, not the least of which is what it would do to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=156.24s)]
*  poor families, what it would do to people on Medicaid, what it would do to the deficit. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=160.96s)]
*  Do you think these House Republicans will stick to their guns this time, tell the president [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=166.12s)]
*  no? Or is he on a glide path? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=170.16s)]
*  Well, the problem is that the president didn't really push one way or the other. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=173.32s)]
*  He just said, let's get it done. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=176.52s)]
*  And I'm not sure that that's going to be enough because there's such a rift between the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=177.72s)]
*  northern Northeastern Republicans and the Freedom Caucus that I don't think just a big [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=182.12s)]
*  Kumbaya is going to help much. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=187.84s)]
*  But the irony here is that this is really one big budget busting bill. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=189.04s)]
*  And Republicans have conventionally been the backbenchers throwing bricks around the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=193.8s)]
*  House. But now they're in charge and it's like the dog who caught the car. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=199.4s)]
*  The problem for them ultimately, I mean, the bigger problem is ultimately they'll pass [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=203.24s)]
*  something. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  And I think the problem is going to be is that for you know, the tariff thing was such [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=208.32s)]
*  a disaster and Republicans kept saying, oh, the this budget bill is going to fix everything. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=212.24s)]
*  I think it's actually going to make it much worse. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=217.36s)]
*  First of all, the tariffs haven't really kicked in. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=219.44s)]
*  And I think they're going to imminently. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=221.44s)]
*  It's going to be a big problem. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  And then when the budget bill passes, assuming it does, it's going to it's going to make [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=225.08s)]
*  the deficit so much worse. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=230.24s)]
*  And that's the irony that Republicans who are supposed to be care about the deficit [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  over time and multiple presidents have actually made the deficit much, much worse. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=235.68s)]
*  And, you know, people on Wall Street and economists are saying that there's really trouble [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=240.24s)]
*  ahead when this bill passes. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, President Trump twice today, Mark, stressed there would be no cuts to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=246.4s)]
*  Medicaid, but just they were attacking waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=250.88s)]
*  And he suggested that there are multiple murderers getting Medicaid, which in this bill adds [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=255.2s)]
*  up to a trillion dollars worth of cuts, not just to Medicaid, but to SNAP, supplemental [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=261.0s)]
*  nutrition to feed low income families. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=265.48s)]
*  I mean, are there any political implications here for some Republicans that will make them [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=268.44s)]
*  even hesitate? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=273.88s)]
*  There's huge implications. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=275.92s)]
*  I mean, the fact is they can't get the numbers to work unless they cut Medicaid. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=277.12s)]
*  And Medicaid is, you know, they're going to or they're going to try and shift that to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=282.24s)]
*  governors and the Republican governors don't want to have to deal with it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=285.68s)]
*  So ultimately, yes. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=288.92s)]
*  And again, the bigger picture here is that there's this huge transfer of wealth going [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=290.44s)]
*  on in the old Bernie Sanders message about, you know, the economic transfer from low income [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=294.88s)]
*  earners to millionaires and billionaires. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=301.72s)]
*  We're going to understand that very clearly when and if this bill passes. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  Melanie, well, let's talk about tonight or tomorrow morning. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=309.2s)]
*  What exactly happens at 1 a.m.? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  With members drinking a lot of Celsius and coffee tonight, this is going to be a key [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=314.23999999999995s)]
*  test for House Republicans. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=320.28s)]
*  These next 24 hours are really going to be crucial because this is the necessary step [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  in order to advance the bill to the floor. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=326.32s)]
*  And there are two conservative hardliners who sit on that committee, and that's Chip [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  Roy and Ralph Norman, both of whom voted present during the House Budget Committee meeting [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  on Sunday. They have major issues with this bill, including how it treats Medicaid. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  However, I did catch up with Norman this morning after that Trump meeting, and he did sound [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=342.12s)]
*  a lot more warm to the bill and to this process. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=346.44s)]
*  So we're getting some signs that it might pass the rules committee. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=349.8s)]
*  I think the bigger test ultimately, of course, is going to be when it comes to the floor. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=353.04s)]
*  As of right now, GOP leaders are planning to do that as soon as tomorrow. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=357.16s)]
*  But there are still a number of holdouts after this meeting. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=360.68s)]
*  We are hearing that there are still some Republicans who are a no on this bill and they want their [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=363.20000000000005s)]
*  issues resolved despite hearing from Donald Trump. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=367.8s)]
*  And so that timeline could easily slip as the speaker and the leadership really try to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=370.16s)]
*  wrangle these remaining holdouts. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcm1oTf3Cg&t=374.48s)]
