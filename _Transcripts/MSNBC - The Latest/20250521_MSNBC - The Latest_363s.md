# 'Unnecessary chaos started by ICE': NJ lawmaker who was with Rep. McIver during clash speaks out
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo)
*  Joining us now is Democratic Congresswoman from New Jersey Bonnie Watson Coleman, who was with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=0.0s)]
*  Congresswoman MacGyver at the ICE facility on the day in question. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=5.36s)]
*  Congresswoman, we appreciate you joining us. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=9.76s)]
*  Have you spoken to Congresswoman MacGyver ahead of today's hearing? And are you worried for her? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=12.56s)]
*  I'm not worried for her that, at the end of the day, she's not absolved of any of these unnecessary [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=18.8s)]
*  and politically motivated allegations against her. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=26.639999999999997s)]
*  I am concerned that we're all under pressure wondering what they're going to do next and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=31.2s)]
*  under what rules are they going to determine what they're going to do. But Monica is strong, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=37.36s)]
*  and I speak to her every day. I'm with her every day. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  Rob and I are standing with her. We were there in the midst of it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=46.96s)]
*  And these allegations against her and this process that they're going forward with [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  her, I believe, is purely politically motivated. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=58.64s)]
*  We're watching the video. We've shown it so many times and tried to dissect it, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  but really want our viewers to judge for themselves what's happening here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=68.0s)]
*  We see you in the video with her there in the tan. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=71.28s)]
*  Here's how the DOJ describes MacGyver's actions. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  The criminal complaint says that she slammed her forearm into the body of one officer, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=78.72s)]
*  forcibly grabbed him, forcibly struck another officer. You were there. Is that what happened? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=83.76s)]
*  No, and not to any of my knowledge, and I was standing pretty close to her. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=90.0s)]
*  But all I kept hearing was, get your hands off of me, get your hands off of me. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=94.88s)]
*  Please don't touch me. Don't touch her. Don't touch us. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=98.72s)]
*  And she kept saying, please don't touch me. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=101.6s)]
*  The interim U.S. attorney who is moving forward with these charges says she wanted to avoid [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=130.24s)]
*  charges. MacGyver says that Alina Habba wanted her to admit to doing something that she didn't do. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=136.96s)]
*  Now, the AP reported yesterday that you're scheduled to meet with Alina Habba today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=143.84s)]
*  Is that still happening? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=147.68s)]
*  No, she's moved it down till Thursday. And Alina Habba is trying to find a way [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=149.36s)]
*  to get out of this thing as gracefully as she can. But if she thinks that she's going to extract [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=156.24s)]
*  from us any kind of admission to any wrongdoing, she's wrong. She's wasting her voice, her time, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=161.68s)]
*  and her effort. This is an act of intimidation, and we're not going to be intimidated. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=168.24s)]
*  We're going to do our job. And our job of oversight was extremely important in a place [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=172.88s)]
*  that opened without having any of the inspections done to ensure that where the people would be [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  housed, the facility would be safe and clean, health care would be there, food would be there, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=185.6s)]
*  et cetera. And at the end of the day, after all of this unnecessary chaos started by ICE, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  we were given our tour. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=198.4s)]
*  Are you concerned you could be charged next? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=201.04s)]
*  I'm concerned that they could try to, yes. So, you know, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=205.04s)]
*  concern only in that I believe that they abused the rule of law. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  Not concerned because I did anything wrong. None of us did anything wrong. We tried to do our job, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  and there was no reason for the situation to go into that direction. And so I'm concerned. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=221.12s)]
*  I don't know what they think they're going to do, but I'm not concerned about the outcome. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  And again, you and your colleagues say you were there to do the congressional oversight. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  That's part of your responsibilities. The other person who was a part of all of this, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=238.4s)]
*  who we've discussed, is the newer mayor, Ross Baraka. He was initially charged with trespassing. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=242.8s)]
*  He was arrested on site. Those charges were dismissed. Here's what he [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  now is saying about these new charges that Congresswoman MacGyver's facing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=253.12s)]
*  I didn't see any of the things that were stated. I didn't see any of those things happen. So [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=259.92s)]
*  I think that the Congresswoman will be vindicated. Elected officials are being targeted in this [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=265.52s)]
*  country. And unfortunately, the people there were being targeted. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=269.92s)]
*  Do you expect that you will all be vindicated in the court of law and at the end of the day, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  that this is going to be sort of a breakthrough or precedent-setting situation? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=280.88s)]
*  I do. And what I think that we also need people to recognize [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  that there's no reason to be moving forward in this manner. And this is only a deflection [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  away from the things that the administration and Republican Congress are doing, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=300.4s)]
*  trying to pass budgets that are going to hurt people in their health care, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=304.23999999999995s)]
*  trying to increase their costs, trying to take food out of the mouths of children, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=308.0s)]
*  and doing it in the dark of night so that people aren't paying attention, so that they think that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=312.4s)]
*  the things that they do in the dark don't come out in the light. But I assure them [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=318.8s)]
*  that we're going to share that information in the light of day. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=323.92s)]
*  So this here stuff, which is just stuff, is a deflection away from all the corruption [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=327.12s)]
*  of this administration. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=335.36s)]
*  Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, thank you so much for the discussion. We appreciate your time [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=337.52s)]
*  today. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=341.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOiZdhUMEo&t=348.8s)]
