# Some companies pull back from Pride events amid Trump WH's DEI crackdown
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug)
*  And with June marking the start of Pride Month, some big corporations are thinking twice about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=0.0s)]
*  how they display support for the LGBTQ plus community. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=5.08s)]
*  It comes as the Trump administration takes a hardline stance against anything to do with [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=8.74s)]
*  diversity, equity or inclusion. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=12.76s)]
*  NBC News correspondent Stephen Romo has more. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=14.76s)]
*  A new survey of more than 200 executives by a risk management research firm shows nearly [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=18.56s)]
*  40% plan to pull back on how they engage with Pride this year. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=24.2s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=28.6s)]
*  60% say they fear backlash from the Trump administration and its actions against diversity, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=29.6s)]
*  equity and inclusion efforts by companies. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=35.56s)]
*  Our country will be woke no longer. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=37.96s)]
*  The cultural shift going beyond just Pride. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=41.88s)]
*  You see here the 14 point drop from Republicans in just four years in supporting same sex [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=44.72s)]
*  marriage, the lowest level of acceptance for the party since 2016. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  When then candidate Trump said this after the Pulse nightclub shooting. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=54.88s)]
*  I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and depression [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=58.68s)]
*  of a hateful foreign ideology. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=69.88s)]
*  Joining us now, national correspondent for USA Today Michael Collins. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=75.28s)]
*  Michael can't help but feel the president was right there in 2016 that we should be [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=79.0s)]
*  protecting this community against violence. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=82.2s)]
*  And yet what we're watching here is this chilling effect from the administration's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=84.28s)]
*  actions of companies who don't want to get on the administration's radar and so they're [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=87.72s)]
*  pulling back their public support for this community. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=92.48s)]
*  In my conversations with advocates as they go into Pride, some of them say, all right, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=95.36s)]
*  maybe they're not being public about it and they should be, but are they still walking [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=99.88s)]
*  the walk and offering those protections internally? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=103.36s)]
*  You know, that's a wonderful question and something that I think that we need to just [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=106.72s)]
*  kind of watch to see what happens. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=109.88s)]
*  You know, the atmosphere that we're seeing right now is so different than what we saw [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=112.84s)]
*  under the Biden and Obama administrations. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=116.72s)]
*  I mean, they frequently embrace, you know, Pride. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=119.64s)]
*  Both presidents held events at the White House celebrating Pride. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  They issued proclamations declaring June as Pride Month, but this administration is not [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=128.24s)]
*  doing any of that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=132.32s)]
*  Yeah, not doing any of that and instead targeting, for example, the trans community, whether [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  it's through reconciliation policy or through Pentagon policy that pulls trans folks out [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=138.76s)]
*  of service. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=144.0s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about the trans erasure that we are seeing? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=145.16s)]
*  Because you've done some really good reporting from veterans of the Stonewall movement, Pride [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=148.64s)]
*  is a riot after all, or at least it started that way, about what they're seeing now marking [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=152.6s)]
*  this Pride Month. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=157.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=158.96s)]
*  So the Stonewall Inn was and is a very popular bar in New York City, in New York City's Greenwich [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=160.32s)]
*  Village, and it was the site of a riot in 1969 that is kind of considered the spark [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=167.72s)]
*  that ignited the LGBT rights movement. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=175.64s)]
*  And in 2016, President Obama designated Stonewall as a national monument because he felt like [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=178.84s)]
*  what happened there was such an important moment in American history and LGBTQ history [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=184.92s)]
*  that he wanted to make sure that what happened was not forgotten and the people who participated [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=190.4s)]
*  in this were not forgotten. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=196.11999999999998s)]
*  President Trump sees things differently. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  His administration has been on a campaign to erase or at least weaken programs that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=200.32s)]
*  he thinks promote what he calls wokeism or diversity and inclusion. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=207.44s)]
*  And you may recall on his first day in office, he signed a number of executive orders. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=212.42s)]
*  One of those orders declared that his administration would only recognize two genders, male and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=217.6s)]
*  female. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=224.28s)]
*  When that happened, agencies all across the federal government started to update their [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=225.44s)]
*  websites to conform to this policy. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=228.88s)]
*  And as a result of that, any reference to transgender people was eliminated from the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  website dedicated to the Stonewall National Monument. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=236.76s)]
*  And that's completely changing the way that we see that history. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=239.92s)]
*  I mean, what are those veterans of Stonewall saying now about that erasure, but also about [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=242.67999999999998s)]
*  this moment in the movement? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  They're really concerned about that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=249.48s)]
*  I talked to a number of people who were there who were involved in the riots. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=251.48s)]
*  One person in particular that I talked to who was inside the bar the night of the raid, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=255.48s)]
*  he said transgender people were there and they were a key part of what happened. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=260.24s)]
*  They fought against police. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=266.32s)]
*  They rioted right alongside gay men and lesbians and other people. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=267.8s)]
*  There were a lot of people who were rioting at Stonewall, but transgender people were [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=272.08s)]
*  a very important part of that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=275.32s)]
*  And he said, you know, what you're seeing the administration do is basically rewrite [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=277.44s)]
*  history or censor history and just, you know, eliminate any reference to what these transgender [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=282.0s)]
*  people helped accomplish. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=289.4s)]
*  It's really important reporting. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=291.92s)]
*  It's important to remember this day as it happened and continue remembering pride that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=293.28s)]
*  way as well. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=297.56s)]
*  Michael Collins, thank you for bringing us your reporting on this important topic. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=298.96s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=301.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSyDtnCug&t=307.44s)]
