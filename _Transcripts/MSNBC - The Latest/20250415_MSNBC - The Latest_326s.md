# Kilmar Abrego Garcia Attorney speaks out against Trump admin’s actions
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE)
*  And joining us now is Rina Gandhi, one of the attorneys representing Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=0.0s)]
*  the Maryland man mistakenly deported to a prison in El Salvador. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=5.12s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=9.36s)]
*  I first want to ask you, your team says the government is not complying with the court's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=10.36s)]
*  order. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=13.84s)]
*  We watched that whole event yesterday with the president of El Salvador and President [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=15.38s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=18.96s)]
*  There was a lot said. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=19.96s)]
*  Some of it seemed to be potentially helpful to you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=20.96s)]
*  Some of it may be less so. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=23.22s)]
*  What role do you think that exchange is going to have later today when you and your team [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  go before a district judge not too far from here in Maryland to order for Abrego-Garcia's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=28.36s)]
*  release? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=32.56s)]
*  Yes, thank you, Christina, for having me. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=33.56s)]
*  It's correct that the government has yet to produce any evidence of its actions, any evidence [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  of a request being made to ask the government of El Salvador to release Mr. Abrego-Garcia. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=43.04s)]
*  I think as we all heard in those statements yesterday, the government of El Salvador [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=50.2s)]
*  is stating or the president of El Salvador is stating that he will not smuggle Mr. Abrego-Garcia [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=56.04s)]
*  into the United States, which of course is not the ask that we're making. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=60.040000000000006s)]
*  I do believe that the ask is yet to be made and that is something that will come up at [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  the hearing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  But considering the president of the United States was sitting what, four or five feet [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=68.52000000000001s)]
*  from the president of El Salvador and was even asked about it and did not ask about [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=72.36s)]
*  your client, is that something you plan on mentioning in court? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=76.36s)]
*  I can't speak to our strategies for court this afternoon. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  However, it is not a secret. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  I think we've all seen that video, certainly read over the statements that were made, and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=87.2s)]
*  it's informative that that ask was not made. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=93.24s)]
*  I also want to ask you, both presidents yesterday as well as some other administration officials [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=96.16s)]
*  accused your client of being a criminal, an MS-13 gang member. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=99.84s)]
*  You mentioned it a little bit, but have you seen any evidence at all to support those [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=104.08s)]
*  claims? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=107.88s)]
*  Is there any truth even in your client's past that we all changed, that maybe he did some [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=108.88s)]
*  things earlier in his life that they could be talking about or is there just, in your [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=112.48s)]
*  opinion, no evidence to support this whatsoever? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=116.56s)]
*  I would refer back to what the district court judge in this case said, which is the evidence [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  presented doesn't show or doesn't lead one to believe that conclusion. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=125.48s)]
*  At this time, no evidence has been submitted to support this allegation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=130.96s)]
*  And should we get what we're asking for, which is Mr. Arrego-Garcia to return home, the government [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=135.96s)]
*  is welcome to introduce that evidence in a motion to reopen, to litigate his withholding [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=141.56s)]
*  of removal grant. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=147.0s)]
*  But at this time, what's relevant is that he was removed unlawfully and the government [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=148.0s)]
*  has made no actions to bring him back. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  Can I also ask you, one of the other questions we've been asking each other, ourselves and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  officials, is how they're choosing these individuals. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=158.96s)]
*  Do you know how your client got on their radar? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  Because quite frankly, my client should not have been on their radar. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  He was granted withholding of removal. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=169.38s)]
*  That means that he is not allowed to be returned to the very place they returned him to. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=172.28s)]
*  How he ended up on this list, how he was hunted down and stopped and taken, moved around [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=175.68s)]
*  the country and removed, I really can't tell you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=181.44s)]
*  I also want to ask you, Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen says he's ready to travel to El [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=184.28s)]
*  Salvador himself and push for your client's return to the U.S. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=188.68s)]
*  But what are the legal limits of what even you or a senator or anyone who is not the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=192.84s)]
*  president of the United States can do to bring Abrego Garcia back because he is a non-citizen? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=198.24s)]
*  Yes, we welcome everyone who's interested and cares about this family to continue caring [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=203.44s)]
*  about this family and stay interested. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=211.84s)]
*  However, this is not the place or time for that type of action given what the Supreme [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=214.44s)]
*  Court has ordered. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=220.8s)]
*  The government is more than well positioned to take action in this case. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=221.8s)]
*  While we appreciate all the efforts that have been made and all the outreach, the government [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  should do what it's been tasked to do and is able to do. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=230.52s)]
*  Secretary of State Rubio in that meeting yesterday said your client is a citizen of El Salvador [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=234.56s)]
*  and that's who should be dealing with him. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  Is there any thought of pivoting your legal strategy to deal with that country instead [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=241.12s)]
*  of the U.S. administration? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=245.78000000000003s)]
*  Is that something, a reality you might have to face at some point? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=247.52s)]
*  I should hope not. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=251.52s)]
*  Given that this country has a strong relationship with the country of El Salvador, we have some [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=252.96s)]
*  contractual agreements with CICOT, the prison he's being held in. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=259.44s)]
*  I think that is a question for a much, much later time and hopefully we'll never have [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=264.12s)]
*  to get there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=268.8s)]
*  I also just want to ask you, you know, on a human level, has his family, have you, has [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=269.8s)]
*  anyone had contact with him since he was sent to El Salvador? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=275.2s)]
*  Do you know how his health is? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=278.24s)]
*  Do you know how his mental health is? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=279.56s)]
*  Have you gotten anything? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=281.56s)]
*  I really wish my answer to this was different. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=282.96s)]
*  The true answer is no. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=286.67999999999995s)]
*  We've had no contact. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=287.67999999999995s)]
*  His family has had no contact outside of the filing stating that he was alive and in CICOT [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=288.67999999999995s)]
*  we've received no other information, update, phone call, video, photo, nothing since then. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=294.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=300.88s)]
*  Reena Gandhi, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=301.88s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=303.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFXJmR5IOE&t=311.4s)]
