# Ali Velshi: Just when you think Trump can't make his Qatari plane controversy worse, he does
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs)
*  Okay, did you think that Donald Trump's attempt to get a $400 million airplane from Qatar [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=0.0s)]
*  couldn't get worse? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=6.68s)]
*  Spoiler alert, here's Trump tonight telling the origin story of the $400 million plane [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=8.48s)]
*  on Fox. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=15.34s)]
*  When we landed, I was parked right next to the 747 of Qatar. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=16.88s)]
*  And we parked next to another 747, two or three of them, which the Arab world has. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=25.22s)]
*  And when you look at a new 747 and you look at a plane that's 42 years old, not even the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=32.5s)]
*  same plane, the other ones are bigger and sleeker and sharper, and it doesn't look right. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=37.46s)]
*  And he said, great gentleman, to me, he said, I would like to help if you want. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=44.06s)]
*  I said, how can you help? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=51.099999999999994s)]
*  Well, we happen to have a plane. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=53.02s)]
*  And I said, well, what do you want? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=55.620000000000005s)]
*  He said, you have been, and he doesn't mean me, although I have been good, he means our [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=57.18000000000001s)]
*  country. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=62.18000000000001s)]
*  And he said, your country has been very good to us. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=63.18000000000001s)]
*  I would love to do something to help with this situation you have with Air Force One. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=68.54s)]
*  I said, that's nice. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  What do you suggest? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=75.66s)]
*  And he suggested this. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=76.7s)]
*  And I said, you know what, that's very nice. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=77.86s)]
*  That's very nice. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=81.10000000000001s)]
*  And he said, what would be the price? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=82.17999999999999s)]
*  He said, there is no price. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=83.89999999999999s)]
*  I said, hmm, that's nice. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=86.97999999999999s)]
*  I made a good deal. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=90.02s)]
*  We need a plane for a couple of years before we get the other ones, because Boeing is very [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=91.3s)]
*  late. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=94.74s)]
*  So if you're actually the president of the United States and somebody gives you a free [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=95.74s)]
*  thing like that, it's not indicative of the fact that you made a good deal. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=102.94s)]
*  It's actually just indicative of the fact that you're the president of the United States [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=106.5s)]
*  and you have a lot of power and people know how you work. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=110.26s)]
*  The president of the United States is not actually going to be allowed to ride around [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=113.22000000000001s)]
*  in an interim, cuttary, hand-me-down jet while a new Air Force One is being built. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  For a lot of very specific military and security reasons, the Air Force Ones take a long time [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=122.62s)]
*  to build because of the extensive security required to carry a president. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  They've got evasive maneuvers and they can refuel in the air. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=133.54000000000002s)]
*  It's not just a normal fancy plane. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=137.42s)]
*  Outfitting that cuttary jet to be an Air Force One could reportedly cost up to a billion [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=140.33999999999997s)]
*  dollars. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=147.94s)]
*  I've seen a lot of estimates, but they're in the several hundred million to a billion. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=148.94s)]
*  Donald Trump said no price, because there's no price for Trump if he can get the American [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=154.38s)]
*  taxpayer to pay for it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  There's so much more to unpack in that scene that Trump described, which we'll discuss [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=162.94s)]
*  in a moment. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=167.9s)]
*  Trump's explanation comes after spending days being dazzled by dictator palaces in the repressive [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=169.57999999999998s)]
*  Middle Eastern countries en route back to the United States and all the pesky frustrations [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=174.34s)]
*  of the fact that back home he's got this liberal democracy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=178.82s)]
*  Sputtering though it may be, it's still a liberal democracy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=182.14s)]
*  He doesn't seem too happy about it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=184.7s)]
*  Maybe that's why he spent today on truth social, lashing out at his Republican allies in Congress [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=187.78s)]
*  and on the Supreme Court who defied him today. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=192.82s)]
*  And also, by the way, at Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  Trump raged at Springsteen for speaking out against him on Wednesday night in England. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=201.38s)]
*  A majority of our elected representatives have failed to protect the American people [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=206.78s)]
*  from the abuses of an unfit president and a rogue government. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=215.54s)]
*  They have no concern or idea of what it means to be deeply American. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=220.94s)]
*  Now in fairness, Trump and Springsteen are both, sorry, Springsteen and Taylor Swift [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=237.3s)]
*  are both billionaires. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=243.22s)]
*  Unlike Trump, however, or the petrostate royals, these two earned their fortune. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=244.9s)]
*  Springsteen and Swift became rich through their talent and their hard work, not through [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=251.18s)]
*  crypto schemes and influence scams and fraudulent universities at stake. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  Trump also went after the Republican-led Supreme Court, which ruled against him again today. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=260.54s)]
*  Quote, the Supreme Court is being played by the radical left losers who have no support [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=265.26s)]
*  and the public hates them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=270.58s)]
*  And their only hope is the intimidation of the court itself. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=272.1s)]
*  We can't let that happen to our country, end quote. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=274.98s)]
*  Seven to two ruling on the Supreme Court, by the way. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=278.86s)]
*  The majority of people on that court support Donald Trump. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  All of this comes after wrapping up a foreign trip where the president of the United States, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  the leader of the free world, ostensibly Donald Trump, appeared much, much more comfortable [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=289.14000000000004s)]
*  in the company of unelected strongmen than with America's democratic allies. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=295.46000000000004s)]
*  In the United Arab Emirates, Trump gushed about how beautiful everything was, oblivious [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=299.94s)]
*  or indifferent to that country's record of repression and censorship. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=304.66s)]
*  Trump praised the dictator of Qatar and fawned over ceremonial camels. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=309.62s)]
*  Carried on a lot about these camels, by the way. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=313.98s)]
*  In Saudi Arabia, Trump was mesmerized by the pageantry, blinded by the gold, the guards. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=316.98s)]
*  Said nothing about the mass executions or people jailed in Saudi Arabia for dissent. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=323.54s)]
*  As the New York Times writes in its piece about the local reaction to Trump's visit [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=329.62s)]
*  to Saudi Arabia, quote, it's impossible to accurately determine what proportion of Saudis [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=332.82s)]
*  have positive views of Mr. Trump. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=337.74s)]
*  Cultural norms favor public conformity. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=340.34000000000003s)]
*  And Prince Mohammed has intensified political repression while expanding social freedoms. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=343.3s)]
*  As a result, many Saudis are reluctant to share their true views in public. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=348.98s)]
*  The son of a prominent cleric imprisoned in Saudi Arabia castigated Mr. Trump for what [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=354.5s)]
*  he described as whitewashing the reputation of Prince Mohammed, who he said was an authoritarian [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=359.4s)]
*  leader who has brutally silenced all dissent, end quote. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  Listen for yourself as Donald Trump played lackey to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=370.23999999999995s)]
*  who according to U.S. intelligence, ordered the dismemberment and murder of the Washington [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=376.2s)]
*  Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi during Trump's first term. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=381.88s)]
*  We have great partners in the world, but we have none stronger and nobody like the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=387.4s)]
*  gentleman that's right before me. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=395.71999999999997s)]
*  He's your greatest representative, greatest representative. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=397.44s)]
*  And if I didn't like him, I'd get out of here so fast. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=407.76s)]
*  He says, I like him. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=412.76s)]
*  He actually said, I think I like him too much. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=414.4s)]
*  And for anyone suggesting this was strictly business because it was a business trip, remember [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=418.64s)]
*  that most of the quote unquote deals that Trump touted were finalized under the Biden [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=423.47999999999996s)]
*  administration. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=429.84s)]
*  The Washington Post reports as Air Force One touched down in the Saudi Arabia, Qatar and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=430.84s)]
*  United Arab Emirates, the White House released daily lists of the dozens of deals that it [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=434.7s)]
*  said Trump had secured during his visits. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=439.32s)]
*  But at least half of the dozen of the contracts were announced before Trump even took office [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=442.08s)]
*  in January. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  Here's one example the Post gave. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  The administration announced $8.5 billion in projects involving the Texas energy company [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=450.44s)]
*  McDermott. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=455.48s)]
*  Except the company previously announced contracts for that initiative during Joe Biden's presidency [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=456.48s)]
*  in 2023 and 2024. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=463.22s)]
*  This fawning praise wasn't some strategic negotiating tactic. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=470.12s)]
*  It was a fraudulent attempt to take credit for Biden's record and, and much more importantly, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=473.62s)]
*  a way to cozy up to corrupt leaders and perhaps pick a new plane or a golf course or a crypto [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=481.94s)]
*  deal, maybe even a Trump tower in Damascus in return. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EOL3adnBs&t=487.16s)]
