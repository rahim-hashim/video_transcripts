# Trump is ‘nuts’ for saying empty ports, tariffs won’t hurt American families: Fmr. Rep. Porter
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI)
*  Growing concerns from lawmakers over the dramatic impact Trump tariffs will have on the US economy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=0.0s)]
*  with a 145 percent tariff on China, a 25 percent tariff on Canada and Mexico, and 10 percent [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=6.4s)]
*  tariffs on dozens of other countries, the flow of goods into the US is expected to slow [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  dramatically. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=18.84s)]
*  This, while the president continues to argue tariffs are needed to boost manufacturing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=19.84s)]
*  in the US, offering this comment when asked about the slowdown at American ports. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=25.04s)]
*  But we're seeing as a result the ports here in the US, the traffic has really slowed and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=32.4s)]
*  now thousands of dock workers and truck drivers are worried about their jobs. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=38.12s)]
*  That means we lose less money. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  When I see that, that means we lose less money. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  I think he's missing the point there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  Let's bring in former California Democratic Representative Katie Porter. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=50.04s)]
*  I'm glad that brought a laugh. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=53.0s)]
*  She's also a candidate for governor of California, which means you got a lot of work ahead of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=54.44s)]
*  you as one would running for such a big state governor. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=57.96s)]
*  That said, congressman, congresswoman, thank you so much. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=60.96s)]
*  As a single mother in Congress, you made headlines talking about the hardships of buying bacon [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=64.6s)]
*  at the grocery store. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=70.22s)]
*  Give us your thoughts on the president's analysis on the ports, which seems to be completely [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=72.28s)]
*  out of touch with the needs of everyday Americans. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's really not funny. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=80.11999999999999s)]
*  And so I apologize for chuckling, but he's nuts when he says this means that we're not [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  like somehow we're not losing money. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=87.08s)]
*  Look, we have zero ships departing from China on a couple of days ago. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=89.6s)]
*  I'm coming into our West Coast ports. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  What's that going to mean for families for Californians? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  It's going to mean that there are fewer goods on the grocery store shelves in retailers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  It's going to mean higher prices. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  This is a simple supply demand thing. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=107.2s)]
*  When less items come in, the prices are able to go up. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=108.92s)]
*  And look, manufacturers, retailers, stores, they're going to pass along these costs to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=111.8s)]
*  consumers. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=117.24s)]
*  And then there's all the effects on workers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=118.24s)]
*  It's not just dot workers. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=120.36s)]
*  It is workers who work at retail and disproportionately, by the way, those workers are women and our [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=122.6s)]
*  moms. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=129.0s)]
*  And so this is going to hurt our entire economy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=130.0s)]
*  This is exactly why I'm running for governor, because we need someone who understands what [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  this really means in everyday families lives. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=136.88s)]
*  Somebody who's listening to people, not making stuff up. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  And I mean, drilling down even further at this, given the slowdown at the ports there on the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=144.04s)]
*  West Coast where you are, I mean, what does this mean for the families as they head into, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=149.12s)]
*  let's say, the summer months and beyond? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  They've got to prepare for back to school purchases, supplies for their kids to go to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=154.88s)]
*  school, the clothing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  All this, do you expect to be affected? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. Look, my son, almost inconceivably to me, just announced he could not fit into [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=164.0s)]
*  his size 14 shoes. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  So we're going to have to go to a 50. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  My daughter's backpack, I put it in the washing machine and unfortunately, it's still filthy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=174.28s)]
*  We're going to need a new backpack. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=179.28s)]
*  And by August, much less going into the holiday season, the effects of these tariffs are going [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  to be in full swing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=186.68s)]
*  People often retailers, they order in advance. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=188.16s)]
*  So we're just at the beginning of seeing the real effects. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  And they're already so bad that I'm hearing day in, day out from small businesses and from [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=194.88s)]
*  everyday people in the grocery store. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=200.56s)]
*  But they are worried about this and they want people who are going to fight Donald Trump. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=202.84s)]
*  They want people who are going to have a strategy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=206.56s)]
*  It's a big part of why I'm running for governor. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  We need someone who will call out Donald Trump's economic policy for what it is. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=210.36s)]
*  Crazy and hurtful. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=215.88s)]
*  Let me let me just say your son's moving into size 15 shoes. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'm a mom thinking about how tall is he? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  He's got to be six foot four, three. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  And he really, to be honest, he's not done growing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  They are downstairs right now attempting to make orange chocolate chip pancakes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=230.0s)]
*  And as I came upstairs to log on to the hit, they said, oh, we're out of most of the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=234.72s)]
*  ingredients. What should we do? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=239.0s)]
*  And I just hope they went to the grocery store to get eggs. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=240.83999999999997s)]
*  I only hope they're not six or seven dollar eggs. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=243.6s)]
*  And so the things that we've seen there, things with things like eggs, I mean, this is [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=246.76s)]
*  like the pandemic, but many, many times worse. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=250.6s)]
*  Unlike the pandemic, this is a bad policy choice. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=253.24s)]
*  So it's really important in these upcoming elections, whether they're for elections like [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=257.48s)]
*  California governor, whether they're for Congress, that people make choices to elect [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=260.8s)]
*  folks who understand what it's like to go shoe shopping, who understand what it's like [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=264.8s)]
*  to put those eggs in the cart or decide they can go another week without. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=269.52s)]
*  The New York Times reports that Democrats are channeling their focus on the plight of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=274.4s)]
*  small businesses. They're writing that they are, quote, being forced to raise prices, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=278.16s)]
*  layoff workers, freeze hiring and slow sales to conserve stock as they absorb the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=282.12s)]
*  impact of Mr. Trump's trade moves. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=288.12s)]
*  Do you think this will be a unifying cry for Democrats if not already? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=290.88s)]
*  Well, I think the cry is coming from everyday people. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=295.68s)]
*  Alex, when I'm in the grocery store, I have a small business owner in my district who [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=298.72s)]
*  imports Christmas items in the city for his business since 1983. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=303.56s)]
*  When I when I was in third grade, he has never had to pay a tariff. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=308.44s)]
*  Now his tariff is one hundred and forty five percent. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=311.64s)]
*  And so he is saying I've got 53 workers. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=314.68s)]
*  I'm going to have to lay them off. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=317.44s)]
*  I don't know if I'm going to be able to pay my rent for my warehouse. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=319.04s)]
*  This is affecting real people right now. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=322.56s)]
*  So, sure. Yes. Democrats in Congress and candidates should be talking about this. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=324.88s)]
*  But whose stories we're lifting up are the real working Americans, because that's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=330.44s)]
*  who's being hurt is our entire economy. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  So, sure, Donald Trump, Ivanka, these people from their gold plated offices are not [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=338.36s)]
*  going to be affected. But how about everybody else? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=344.24s)]
*  And Donald Trump, quite simply, has no answer for them. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's why as California governor, I have an answer, which is I'm going to fight [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=351.56s)]
*  to grow California's economy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=354.64s)]
*  And it's going to be tough because of Donald Trump. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=356.48s)]
*  But that's why we need people who are really, really smart about economic issues, who are [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=359.16s)]
*  really listening to where the pain points are for families, because Donald Trump is [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=362.96s)]
*  making it harder. But I'm all in on the fight to make it better for California families. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=366.6s)]
*  Well, definitely come back and talk to us about that as you pursue the gubernatorial [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=371.32s)]
*  position there in California. In the meantime, enjoy your chocolate chip pancakes from [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=375.8s)]
*  Mother's Day. They sound yummy. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=379.24s)]
*  We'll see if they turned out. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=380.56s)]
*  Well, we're hoping. Here's to that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=381.84s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=384.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6OpROKgcI&t=389.0s)]
