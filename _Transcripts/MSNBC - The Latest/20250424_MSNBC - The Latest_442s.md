# 'Not going to work': Why Fmr. Amb. says Trump can't just 'declare' an end to Russia's war
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w)
*  Joining us now Peter Baker chief White House correspondent for the New York Times and an NBC News political analyst also with us is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=0.0s)]
*  Ambassador Ivo dollar former US ambassador to NATO so Peter where do the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Talks to end the war in Ukraine stand right now [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=11.6s)]
*  Well, it's a little bit of an uncertainty because you hear impatience on the part of Trump and his people [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=15.88s)]
*  Which is interesting because of course these things were never going to happen quickly [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=21.54s)]
*  Even though Trump told everybody during the campaign last year that he could end the war in 24 hours [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=24.7s)]
*  In fact, it would be so easy. He could do it before he was even inaugurated [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=28.68s)]
*  Well, it's not so easy and it's not so easy in part because Vladimir Putin his friend the person he has expressed so much [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=32.44s)]
*  admiration for the one he has called a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=38.28s)]
*  Genius is not in fact ready to end the war not on turn [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=40.64s)]
*  Not unless the terms are so advantageous to Russia that Ukraine couldn't possibly accept them as it is the proposal that we've learned about [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=43.96s)]
*  So far but coming from Trump is pretty much [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=51.92s)]
*  One sided towards Russia in a lot of ways that has been you know [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  unacceptable to to Ukraine but these launched these strikes that we're seeing and the pictures that you're showing right now [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  Indicate that Putin is not in fact, you know ready for peace and he's trying to take advantage on the battlefield of the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=66.28s)]
*  Latitude that Trump has given him by undercutting the Ukrainians [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=74.08s)]
*  So we'll see whether this actually changes Trump's attitude if he actually does [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=78.82s)]
*  Seem to be angry at Putin in a way that changes his calculation, but so far that hasn't been the case [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=82.94s)]
*  Ambassador three years into this invasion 11 years after the Russians invaded Crimea. How does this possibly end? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=90.34s)]
*  Well, you know, I think the president's tweet this morning or post this morning for the first time actually had it, right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=99.1s)]
*  This war ends when Vladimir stops [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  This war started because Vladimir Putin decided to annex Crimea and invade Ukraine and rightly as you mentioned [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=109.62s)]
*  That happened in 2014 in the four years that President Trump was was president in his first term. He did not [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=117.58000000000001s)]
*  Stop this war. He was not able to stop the war [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=125.82000000000001s)]
*  In fact because he in many ways sucked up to Vladimir Putin the Russian president [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=128.70000000000002s)]
*  He gave the signal to the Russians that they could continue [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=135.22s)]
*  This war and we need to look at this war not just what happened since February of 2022 [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=139.38s)]
*  But really since what's happening of February of 2014. This war has been going on for 11 [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=145.34s)]
*  11 years before the full-scale invasion that Ukrainians had already lost major parts of their territory and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=151.1s)]
*  30,000 soldiers have been killed and the way that this war stops is very very simple [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=157.62s)]
*  It is when the pressure on Russia is significantly enough that they decide that the benefits of continuing the war are [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=162.54s)]
*  Outweighed by the benefits of stopping and the way to do that is not by giving them sanction relief, which is what the president is doing [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=169.66s)]
*  Recognizing territorial gains by the use of force, which the president is proposing [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=177.38s)]
*  But by putting significant pressure on on Russia economic pressure [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=182.06s)]
*  Diplomatic pressure not voting with the with Russia at the UN but voting against Russia at the UN and of course helping Ukraine to defend itself [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=187.56s)]
*  Ukraine is the victim in this war. It needs to be in under all international law [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=195.44s)]
*  We have they have the right to defend themselves [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  We have a right to support them in that defense and that's how this war ends the idea that you can [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  Declare an end to the war which seems to be president [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=209.4s)]
*  Trump's motives of operation [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=213.36s)]
*  It's just not going to work as Peter I think rightly underlined [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=216.24s)]
*  now ambassador so much to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=221.12s)]
*  Dissect in what you're mentioning, but but if we focus on 2014 on that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=224.0s)]
*  Russian annexation of Crimea taking Crimea the world in the United States reacted with horror and never [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=229.68s)]
*  Recognized it, you know de jure it wasn't legal de facto [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=238.0s)]
*  They let it happen. They let it continue to happen and that's not something that started [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=243.56s)]
*  five minutes ago [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=249.12s)]
*  when the world has not stood up and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=251.48s)]
*  demanded that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=255.84s)]
*  violations of in the case of of Ukraine [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  territory be returned or else [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=262.24s)]
*  Then it all falls on words ambassador. Where is that divide and how do you how do you shorten that divide? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=265.48s)]
*  Well clearly sanctions were imposed on Russia in 2014 in response, but you're right the response in 2014 [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  And I think could history will show was not the right response. It was too weak [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=280.72s)]
*  Against a major strategic change [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  The truth the attempt to change borders by the use of force, but that doesn't mean we should recognize it [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  Remember the United States did not recognize the annexation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=292.6s)]
*  1941 by the then Soviet Union and indeed it took 50 years for these countries to be independent [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=299.4s)]
*  But when they did become independent they were independent and at least the United States could say we never recognized this incorporation [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=304.88s)]
*  And and yet what is Donald Trump doing now? He is suggesting that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=311.64s)]
*  Recognizing that Crimea is part of Russia be part of a peace agreement. That is completely and totally unacceptable [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  We didn't even do that in 1941 when we weren't part [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  Of a party to the war and World War two and we shouldn't be doing it now [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=327.24s)]
*  Peter where does this leave the slide scamming? What is his bargaining position? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=333.52s)]
*  Well, I mean look, you know one thing that President Trump told him in that famous meltdown in the Oval Office was that Zelensky [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=340.76s)]
*  Doesn't have any cards to play. It is certainly the case that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=346.53999999999996s)]
*  Zelensky has been dependent on the United States now for these last three years, you know in a very important way [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=350.44s)]
*  Not just in terms of weapons, but in terms of intelligence help in targeting, you know on the battlefield [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=356.0s)]
*  Can Europe step up into that void if the United States pulls back? That's not really clear. Honestly [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=361.56s)]
*  There's not a lot of history there Europe has done an awful lot done more in fact in terms of spending money [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=366.48s)]
*  For Ukraine these last three years contrary to what President Trump says [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=370.48s)]
*  But they don't have the same capacities that the United States military does in terms of providing help [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=373.56s)]
*  For Ukrainians and I think that that means Zelensky to some extent is dependent on on Trump now [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=378.28s)]
*  He's trying to play it a little bit more [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=383.1s)]
*  Carefully than he did in that Oval Office meeting [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=385.38s)]
*  He's trying to make the case that he actually is for peace and it's true as Putin is the one who is [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  Interested in continuing the war at the same time Zelensky can't agree to some of the conditions that Trump is putting on the table [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=393.82000000000005s)]
*  They're just simply not [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=399.34000000000003s)]
*  Tenable for a Ukrainian leader [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=401.70000000000005s)]
*  He's got his own domestic politics to think about his own people are willing to go along with some of the things that Trump is [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=403.42s)]
*  Asking of them and so I think that he's kind of stuck in this in this [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=408.58000000000004s)]
*  Awkward position he's got the Europeans on his side [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=412.78000000000003s)]
*  But doesn't necessarily mean that that's going to help him with Trump and so he wants us for Trump to be angrier at Putin [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=415.1s)]
*  Than angrier him [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2-R2RNt5w&t=420.64000000000004s)]
