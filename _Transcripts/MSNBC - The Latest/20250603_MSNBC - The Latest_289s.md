# 'Big setback for the Russians': Fmr. Ukraine Amb. calls drone strike 'major accomplishment'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo)
*  I want to bring in now former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=0.0s)]
*  who served in both the Obama and first Trump administrations. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  He also recently returned from the region. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=6.8s)]
*  Ambassador, since that big surprise attack, Putin's been silent. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=9.36s)]
*  Even the U.S. has been pretty quiet on this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=14.24s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=16.8s)]
*  So this is a big setback for the Russians. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=19.44s)]
*  The Russians have been quiet, although the bluster from on the Vyatav is pretty standard. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=21.68s)]
*  But it is surprising that the Americans haven't expressed their appreciation and support for this [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  big attack. This is a major accomplishment for the Ukrainians and demonstrates not only military [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=33.76s)]
*  capabilities, but also political determination to stay in this fight and prevail. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=39.84s)]
*  We all remember that Oval Office encounter President Trump telling Ukraine Zelensky, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=45.28s)]
*  you don't have the cards. Let's remind everyone. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=50.64s)]
*  You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=54.24s)]
*  With us, you start having cards. Right now, you don't have your playing cards. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=60.32s)]
*  You're playing cards. You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=64.08s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=68.88s)]
*  Ambassador, does this special operation spiderweb suggest Ukraine does have the cards here? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=75.28s)]
*  They absolutely have the cards. They've demonstrated it just this morning. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=81.83999999999999s)]
*  You've probably reported as well. They struck this Kirch Bridge, the bridge that Putin [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=86.32s)]
*  described and initiated, finally connecting Russia to Crimea that they have been occupied. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=91.52s)]
*  So yeah, they've got cards and they're playing them. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  Is there a scenario, though, where this attack backfires when it comes to ceasefire efforts? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=102.8s)]
*  Can you imagine Putin backing down? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=107.84s)]
*  I can imagine Putin backing down, in particular, if President Trump decides that he is going to put [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=111.36s)]
*  economic sanctions on the Russians, which he's threatened to do. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=118.24s)]
*  And as you know, Senator Graham has 81 co-sponsors on a bill to put incredible sanctions on any [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=122.24s)]
*  nation that buys Russian oil. The Russian oil revenues are what's keeping this war going, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=129.44s)]
*  keeping the Russians in this fight. And so the combination of sanctions, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=134.96s)]
*  as well as additional military support for Ukraine, can bring Putin to the table. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=139.12s)]
*  I mean, coming out of the Russia-Ukraine talks yesterday in Istanbul, as Kir showed us, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=143.6s)]
*  Russia's memorandum for peace reads much more like a list of demands for Ukraine's surrender, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=148.32s)]
*  including making Russian an official language, ceding multiple Ukrainian regions to Russia. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=153.52s)]
*  You say it's about the Trump actions getting harder on Putin that could result in more progress at [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=160.4s)]
*  the negotiating table. So what do you make of the Trump arguments or suggestion that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=168.0s)]
*  he doesn't want to do anything that would sort of kerfuffle these negotiations? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=173.04s)]
*  So the way to bring Putin to the table, the way to get these negotiations to work, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=180.0s)]
*  is to put the pressure on Putin. That's what has to happen in order to make this work. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=185.6s)]
*  This is the top foreign policy priority for this administration. Started, of course, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=190.16s)]
*  when President Trump was candidate Trump and said he would resolve this war within 24 hours. But [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  to their credit, they spent a lot of time on this issue. And so they're going to need to push [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  to make this thing work, make the negotiations work and to push. They need to put economic [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=208.24s)]
*  sanctions on and they need to provide weapons to the Ukrainians. Do you see a time in the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=213.36s)]
*  near future where Putin and Zelensky sit down face to face? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=217.76s)]
*  It's hard to see that. There is no indication that there is an agreement between these between [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=223.6s)]
*  the two. I mean, you've described what the Russians are demanding, which is just total nonsense. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=229.6s)]
*  Nonsense. It's a nonstarter. It makes no sense for the Ukrainians to surrender. We see the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=234.32s)]
*  Ukrainians on the front foot. The Ukrainians have the initiative with the attack on the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=239.68s)]
*  Kirch Bridge, which the attack on all these air bases. The Ukrainians are feeling good about [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=243.44s)]
*  where they are. And so they're not ready to they're never going to surrender as the Russians have [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=248.24s)]
*  demanded. So, yes, I think that this is going to be a longer term issue that the that the until [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=253.28s)]
*  Putin knows that he's going to lose and he comes to the table after the economic pressure. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=260.08s)]
*  Ambassador Bill Taylor, appreciate your time. Thanks as always. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=265.68s)]
*  you [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQKX04HI0Wo&t=273.44s)]
