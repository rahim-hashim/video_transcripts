# 'Campaign of defamation': Trump admin hurling 'propaganda' against Abrego Garcia, family lawyer says
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk)
*  The human consequences of Trump's mass deportation plans are coming into sharper focus. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=0.0s)]
*  Gothamist reports that after the administration terminated contracts that fund attorneys and legal services for unaccompanied children, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=5.66s)]
*  shelters across New York have begun seeing migrant kids sitting in front of computer and TV screens, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=12.82s)]
*  appearing virtually in court proceedings without parents or legal representation. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=19.22s)]
*  That included a seven-year-old boy wearing a shirt emblazoned with a pizza cartoon that spun a toy windmill while the judge spoke. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=23.82s)]
*  There was an eight-year-old girl and her four-year-old sister in a tie-dye shirt who squeezed a pink plushie toy and stuffed it into her sleeve. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=31.22s)]
*  None of the children were accompanied by parents or attorneys, as the judge presiding tells them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=38.74s)]
*  The reason we're here is because the government of the United States wants you to leave. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=44.82s)]
*  This, of course, follows a judge granting the DOJ an extension and deportation case of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=50.82s)]
*  the Maryland man who was sent to El Salvador as part of an administrative error. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=56.78s)]
*  The administration is not working to fix. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=61.42s)]
*  Something that apparently wasn't an isolated incident with NBC News reporting of another Venezuelan, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  this time a 20-year-old migrant, also being mistakenly deported. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=69.42s)]
*  Joining me now, attorney Chris Newman, who's representing the family of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=73.02000000000001s)]
*  and NBC News correspondent David Noriega, who joins us from San Salvador. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=77.32s)]
*  Chris, what is the update? What can you tell us in the case of Abrego-Garcia? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=81.32s)]
*  Well, see, first off, thanks for having me on the show. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=86.72s)]
*  I was just in El Salvador two days ago, accompanying the four congresspeople who went down to fight for Mr. Abrego-Garcia's rights. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=91.72s)]
*  And unfortunately, I'm sad to report that we have no new news. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=101.41999999999999s)]
*  The last, in fact, that we do know about Kilmar is what we've learned from Senator Van Hollen on Thursday of last week, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=107.12s)]
*  when the president brought him to the hotel for that staged photo op. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=114.82000000000001s)]
*  The good news is that we at least learned that as of Thursday of last week, Kilmar was alive and his health was OK. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=119.72s)]
*  Unfortunately, he still has not yet had access to counsel or access to his family as is required by international law. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=128.62s)]
*  And do you have a sense of what that is going to require, the fight to get this man due process? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  I think it's going to require a lot more congressional delegations following the lead of Senator Van Hollen and going down and demanding access and attention. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=144.32s)]
*  It's clear that the Trump administration is trying to litigate this case in the court of opinion using their propaganda outlets and engaging in essentially a campaign of defamation. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=156.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, Kilmar is essentially in what amounts to sort of a black site in El Salvador, like tens of thousands of other Salvadorans. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  His family doesn't know where he is, how he's doing, and they have no access to him. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=176.32s)]
*  So he's in the position that tens of thousands of Salvadorans are in. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=180.82s)]
*  And I think to the extent that there's a silver lining in this urgent human rights crisis, it is that there is attention being focused on the lawlessness in El Salvador. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  And my hope is that other senators and more congressional representatives will follow the lead of Congressman Garcia, Congressman West and Senator Van Hollen and others. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=197.92s)]
*  So, David, let's talk about those human rights violations. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=209.62s)]
*  I want to take a look at scenes from outside La Esperanza, an infamous Salvadoran prison you visited there, I believe, yesterday. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=213.52s)]
*  What can you tell us about your reporting there, David? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=220.32s)]
*  Alicia, the crucial thing to understand about the prison system in El Salvador is that it's happening in it exists in this context. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=225.82s)]
*  About three years ago, President Bukele declared a state of emergency suspending basic constitutional protections like the right to due process, the presumption of innocence. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=231.72s)]
*  The people who are in Salvadoran prisons across the prison system are cut off completely from access to loved ones, access to counsel, access to the outside world. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=240.52s)]
*  Then there are the conditions in those prisons. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=249.12s)]
*  When we visited La Esperanza, also known as Mariona, one of the first things that I noticed was that loved ones of prisoners were outside the facility buying things for their loved ones inside [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=250.92s)]
*  that you would think the prison would provide to them, basic things like toilet paper, even the clothing that they wear in the prison. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=260.32s)]
*  If they needed new or clean clothing, their families had to buy it for them. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=266.12s)]
*  One of the most popular items that gets bought for prisoners inside is protein powder, like a protein shake, which is used to supplement the meager food that they receive on the inside. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=269.42s)]
*  Human rights groups have documented numerous deaths due to severe malnutrition, as well as many other factors. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=277.82s)]
*  I've heard reports of extremely minimal medical attention, severe overcrowding, systematic torture. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=284.42s)]
*  The list goes on, Alicia. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=290.82s)]
*  Now, I should say the Bukele administration has acknowledged at times that some innocent people have wound up in prison due to his state of exception and crackdown, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  although he says that he has released thousands and is going to release all of them. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=300.02000000000004s)]
*  Human rights groups here dispute that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=303.62s)]
*  They say many are still on the inside and like the deportees from the United States have virtually no recourse, no way of appealing their situation, Alicia. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=304.92s)]
*  David, just to put a finer point on that, I want to play a part of your interview with someone who described what it is like inside these prisons. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=313.82s)]
*  To sleep on the floor, we slept like boxed bread on our sides because we couldn't all fit on the floor. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=323.12s)]
*  It was horrible. The guards would come in and yell at us that we were trash, rats who were being left to die. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=329.62s)]
*  And they didn't even allow us any religion. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=339.42s)]
*  Nothing. We didn't even look at the sun. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=342.62s)]
*  I remember they sealed the only window there so we couldn't see through to the other side. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=345.82s)]
*  We were like a concentration camp, like the Nazis. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=351.72s)]
*  That's how we consider ourselves. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rt1_TZIxVk&t=356.92s)]
