# 'A lot of work to do': Kentucky Gov. Beshear details devastation after deadly tornado outbreak
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE)
*  Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear joins me now and I'm really sorry you and your constituents [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=0.0s)]
*  are going through this again. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=5.84s)]
*  Where do things stand Governor and is it possible the death toll could still grow? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=7.36s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=13.68s)]
*  This was an F3 and maybe even an F4 tornado that hit Somerset, took one life, mainly hit [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=14.74s)]
*  a commercial area and then tore through two subdivisions in the airport in London, Kentucky. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=22.54s)]
*  Where it hit directly, there's nothing left of the homes but a two-foot pile of rubble. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=29.88s)]
*  We think we have our arms around the current death toll which sits at 19. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=36.0s)]
*  We still have three individuals in critical condition and we are praying for their recovery. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=41.46s)]
*  We have about 800 people we're sheltering right now, thankfully no more missing people. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=46.76s)]
*  But there is a lot of work to do ahead and if this wasn't bad enough, with all the weather [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=53.2s)]
*  disasters we've had, with three major weather disasters this year, we've got tough weather [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=58.58s)]
*  coming in tonight and then a significant severe storm coming in tomorrow and it's going to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=64.22s)]
*  hit some of the same places. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=70.34s)]
*  Yeah I'm wondering what your forecasters are telling you specifically but also I've covered [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=72.46s)]
*  my share of tornadoes. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=77.74s)]
*  I've never seen anything like the pictures I'm seeing out of your state right now and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=79.14s)]
*  It sounds like a question maybe better left to a scientist but what is going on Governor? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=85.66000000000001s)]
*  Well sadly I have seen tornadoes like this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=91.46000000000001s)]
*  The ones in 2021 that ripped through Mayfield and my dad's hometown of Dawson Springs, we [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=94.26s)]
*  lost 81 in that one. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  This weather system just as traumatic for every family that lost an individual but this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=102.66s)]
*  is our 14th I believe federally declared weather disaster in the last five and a half years. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  We keep getting hit over and over and as much as we could get caught up in that, our job [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=116.25999999999999s)]
*  is to be there for our people. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=123.12s)]
*  We already have recovery efforts underway. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  We've got both immediate housing and we've got some partnerships we're going to announce [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=129.84s)]
*  to help people get through the week. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=133.56s)]
*  We've got a travel trailer program we're going to set up in a nearby park to help people [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=135.48s)]
*  really through the months and even the next year. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=139.8s)]
*  We've got our groups on site right now surveying the damage so we can apply for a major disaster [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  declaration from the president and hopefully get direct FEMA assistance to our people. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=148.54s)]
*  I can't tell you the why, the why we keep getting hit over and over but I can tell you [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=155.04s)]
*  we are strong people. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=160.48s)]
*  We get up time and time again and a big part of that is the rest of the world and especially [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=162.2s)]
*  the rest of the country shows up to help us out. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  And I know you've been complimentary of that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=170.16s)]
*  I've been complimentary of FEMA. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  The fact also is that FEMA's programs built to help recover from damage, to help survivors, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  has been cut pretty significantly. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  How confident are you that the financial help you need will be there? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=182.6s)]
*  Well, I'm very concerned about the future of FEMA, very concerned about the future of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=187.88s)]
*  the National Weather Service, which tells us about these in advance. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=194.64s)]
*  But I do want to reiterate that our current reality is that the president has approved [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=199.12s)]
*  our request from the last two major disaster declarations and their FEMA operation on the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=205.12s)]
*  ground is one of the best I've seen. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=210.44s)]
*  And that's why I think it needs to continue. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  They're doing a good job of helping people when they've been knocked down and without [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  the federal government in partnership with the state government, they're not going to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=218.56s)]
*  be able to get back up at least as fast as we do. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  And if you think about these disasters happening more and more and more often, what could be [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=226.2s)]
*  a more sacred role for government than first protecting its people by letting them know [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=232.0s)]
*  when this is going to happen and second, being there for them in the most difficult of days [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  when they've lost everything, maybe even people they love and saying, we are going to help [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=242.72s)]
*  you rebuild. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=247.04s)]
*  So let's talk about the speed of recovery. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=248.44s)]
*  Governor, I know you have shared information about how people in Kentucky can apply for [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  federal assistance, but our local TV affiliate there reports that weeks after April's major [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=254.84s)]
*  flooding, some communities are still waiting for the federal money to come to them. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=260.52s)]
*  So do you have a sense of how long people might have to wait for relief from this disaster? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=265.6s)]
*  April's disaster and February's, we flooded massively in February and in April. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=271.56s)]
*  We're really widespread, especially April hit the entire state. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=277.96s)]
*  And so what we have to do is have enough damage in each county, not just that happened, but [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  that we have documented to provide to the federal government. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=287.84s)]
*  We've had two rounds come through and get approved. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=291.12s)]
*  We have a third round in there and the federal government is taking a decent amount of time, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=293.52s)]
*  but they are ultimately approving the requests with a couple of minor exceptions. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=299.12s)]
*  This one is very localized. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=303.85999999999996s)]
*  This one is primarily in about four to five counties with the massive damage in two to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=305.38s)]
*  three. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=312.58s)]
*  So we've got more than 10 teams in one county alone doing the evaluation today. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=313.58s)]
*  So we think that the initial applications can be in this week, but we're looking at [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  a matter of weeks, we hope, before we can get a decision and hopefully FEMA folks who [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=323.74s)]
*  are already on the ground. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=329.08s)]
*  We just need to move them from a natural disaster three months ago to ultimately opening [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=330.92s)]
*  a recovery center for this one. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=337.26s)]
*  That's how hard we've been hammered, but hopefully we can take the fact that we've got FEMA people [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=339.18s)]
*  on the ground right now and provide faster services for our people. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=343.70000000000005s)]
*  Well we hope along with you for a fast recovery and certainly we know that weather forecasts [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=347.86s)]
*  can prove not accurate. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=352.54s)]
*  We hope it's not accurate that you get hit again in the coming hours and days. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=354.58000000000004s)]
*  Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, thank you at this very busy time for taking time to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=358.98s)]
*  talk to us. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=363.04s)]
*  Thank you for telling our story. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-16dm0eLE&t=364.76s)]
