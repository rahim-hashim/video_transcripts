# 'We are going to overcome this': Beto O'Rourke shares outlook for U.S. amid Trump's second term
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I)
*  But meanwhile, I can tell you the President Trump is expected to travel to Alabama tomorrow [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=0.0s)]
*  to give the commencement address at the University of Alabama. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=4.28s)]
*  The school's college Democrats plan to hold a protest before the president's speech. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=6.72s)]
*  At that protest, former Texas Democratic Congressman Beto O'Rourke is expected to speak. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  And Beto O'Rourke joins us this morning. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=16.22s)]
*  He is also the founder of the activist group Powered by People. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=18.88s)]
*  Beto, it's always a pleasure to see you, my friend. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=22.8s)]
*  I thank you for your time. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=24.5s)]
*  I was just curious how you would grade President Trump's first 100 days in office. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=26.2s)]
*  He's failing by any measure that matters to anyone. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=34.56s)]
*  Our pocketbook, our retirement fund, the economy, our jobs, investment in industry, everything [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=39.28s)]
*  that we care about and that matters to us in our day-to-day lives, and then more importantly, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=47.96s)]
*  what matters to us as Americans, our constitution, the rule of law, and our very democracy are [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=52.64s)]
*  all worse off for 100 days of Donald Trump. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  And here's the good news in all of that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=63.04s)]
*  It is provoking a response everywhere across this country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=65.24s)]
*  You mentioned I'll be in Tuscaloosa, Alabama tomorrow, but I was just in Waco, Texas, in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=69.06s)]
*  Denton, Texas this weekend. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=74.6s)]
*  Both places, more than a thousand people came out, Republicans, Democrats, independents, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=76.66s)]
*  not for a candidate or for a political party, but they're standing up to be counted for [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=81.98s)]
*  our country at this moment of truth. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=86.22s)]
*  And it is pretty damn inspiring because we've gone through some rough patches before as [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=89.46000000000001s)]
*  a country and it takes us a little while, but we always come through. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=93.7s)]
*  So we're going to get through this one and we're going to be the better and the stronger [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=97.54s)]
*  for it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  Why do you think that the state of the Democratic Party, at least in the eye of the majority [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=103.02000000000001s)]
*  of Americans, has fallen to the level it has? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=109.92s)]
*  Some polls show 27 percent support for the Democratic Party. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  Why has that happened? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=121.04s)]
*  And if we are in a moment of truth, Beto, where is that truth breaking through when [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=123.04s)]
*  you have, I guess, the majority of the American people that don't see the Democratic Party [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=129.94s)]
*  as the party that can cut through and give those truths? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=136.28s)]
*  There are some exceptions to what I'm about to say. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=142.96s)]
*  I think about Bernie Sanders and AOC and Tim Walz and others, but by and large, our party [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=145.2s)]
*  has been governed by consultants and pollsters and focus groups and money and not people. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=151.64s)]
*  If you're not with the people, you're not going to win. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=158.82s)]
*  As Joe Strummer said, without people, you're nothing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=162.24s)]
*  And so showing up in these town halls, going to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, going to Tulsa, Oklahoma, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=165.16s)]
*  going to wherever the fight is and being with, listening to and fighting alongside the people [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=170.88s)]
*  that you want to serve is absolutely everything. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=176.88s)]
*  And those Democrats who will heed this lesson and answer the call of the people of America [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=180.4s)]
*  not only will be successfully politically in these next elections, but they'll be the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=185.64s)]
*  leaders who will bring us through this trial that we're undergoing right now. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=190.16s)]
*  Last thing on this, I know that we're concerned about the lack of due process, these deportations, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=195.28s)]
*  not just of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, but young U.S. citizen children, including those with [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=200.84s)]
*  cancer who are deported without their medications. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=206.0s)]
*  We are going to rise up and we're going to overcome this. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=209.32s)]
*  When Trump was doing family separation in 2018, we rose up and in Tornillo, Texas, and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=212.38s)]
*  I knew you covered this, Jose, we had more than a thousand people who stood and witnessed [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=217.92s)]
*  what was happening to those kids, transmitted it to the rest of the country. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=223.54s)]
*  Within days, Trump rescinded that family separation policy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=227.62s)]
*  So public sentiment, as Lincoln said, is everything. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=231.58s)]
*  So all of us have to do all that we can with what we have, where we are, stand up at this [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=234.66s)]
*  moment of truth and be counted, push back, fight back until we win. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=239.7s)]
*  One of the things, of the many things that I know about you is your deep well of knowledge [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=245.7s)]
*  on the issue of immigration and not only immigration from a legislative perspective also, but the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=251.85999999999999s)]
*  impact of immigration on regular people. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=258.36s)]
*  We've talked so long, Beto, you and I, about the possibility of immigration reform in Washington, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=262.3s)]
*  something that seems to be increasingly a distant possibility. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=267.94s)]
*  The border is virtually shut down under President Trump. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=272.21999999999997s)]
*  How do you see this changing, evolving? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=276.88s)]
*  Is there any light for, for example, the possibility of some comprehensive immigration reform to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=280.94s)]
*  happen? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=287.94s)]
*  There is, believe it or not. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=290.1s)]
*  The president has overreached and what he's done, as we just learned from the New York [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=291.94s)]
*  Times poll this week, is actually deeply unpopular amongst the American public. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=296.62s)]
*  Even though this might have been a decisive issue in his election victory in November, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=301.46s)]
*  this is something that is now unpopular across the country. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=306.86s)]
*  That creates an opening for leaders who believe in the Constitution, rule of law, and a better America. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=310.66s)]
*  It opens the door for people who have experiences like those of us on the border who understand [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=316.66s)]
*  that El Paso is safe, it is secure, it is strong, not in spite of, but because we are a city of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  immigrants and this is one of the greatest assets our country has. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=328.14s)]
*  Now, the test is going to be for the next Democrat to occupy the White House, especially if they have [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  the same priorities in the House and Senate because we saw it in 2009, we saw it in 2021, and in both of those [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=337.1s)]
*  Democratic administrations, they did not make immigration a priority. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=343.1s)]
*  It must be for the next one. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=346.82000000000005s)]
*  If we fail to do that, that opens the door to a would-be tyrant like Trump who will suspend [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=348.5s)]
*  due process, who will try to destroy the Constitution and not just pursue immigrants and undocumented [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=354.22s)]
*  immigrants as we've seen, but also deport U.S. citizens as he's already done and as he's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=360.18s)]
*  promised to do more of. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=365.26s)]
*  So, look, the ball is in our court right now as Democrats who believe in this country of immigrants, asylum [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=367.02s)]
*  seekers, and refugees that still stands as the greatest hope on the planet today. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=374.1s)]
*  I'm looking forward to that leadership right now. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=379.78000000000003s)]
*  And Trump has given us that opportunity with these deeply unpopular policies. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=382.46000000000004s)]
*  You say the next Democrat to occupy the White House. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=387.26s)]
*  What kind of Democrat do you think that will be? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=390.06s)]
*  And Beto, when you're talking about how the structure and infrastructure of political [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=394.7s)]
*  organizations has for so long been in the hands of so few, how do you change that reality and that dynamic? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=402.46s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of talk within the Democratic Party about whether we should moderate, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=413.21999999999997s)]
*  whether we should be more progressive, where we are on the political spectrum. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=418.21999999999997s)]
*  I really think this is a binary choice at this moment. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=421.94s)]
*  You are either going to stand and fight or you are going to surrender. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=425.46s)]
*  And I'm in the part of my party that wants to stand and fight, fight on every front, on every single issue, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=430.14s)]
*  fight back against every single attack against every American who is being pursued by this [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=437.46s)]
*  administration right now and fight for a better country, an administration that will replace the one that we have [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=442.9s)]
*  right now and really deliver for every single American, regardless of geography or party or any other difference between us. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=448.90000000000003s)]
*  The power, again, Jose, in my opinion, is with people. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=458.14s)]
*  You know, our group, powered by people, empowers everyday Texans. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=461.3s)]
*  We don't ask their party affiliation. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=465.46000000000004s)]
*  We say no me importa. If you're Republican, if you're Democrat, if you're independent, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=467.1s)]
*  if you want to get to work saving this country, we'll train you, we'll certify you as a volunteer [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=470.94s)]
*  as a deputy registrar and we'll get you out there bringing new voters onto the rolls, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=475.22s)]
*  staying in touch with them and turning them out ahead of the next election. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=479.46s)]
*  We're not waiting till 2026 or 2028. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=482.74s)]
*  We're doing the work right now today because this is when it matters. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=486.02s)]
*  Beto O'Rourke, it's always a pleasure. I thank you for your time. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hyBBz61Z1I&t=490.3s)]
