# Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo the latest to be targeted by Trump’s Justice Department
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs)
*  He makes up facts. He makes up science. He wants to deny the COVID virus. He has from day one. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=0.0s)]
*  We know that when COVID started, he knew how bad it was going to be. And he just lied about it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=8.0s)]
*  We airlifted medical supplies, built hospitals from scratch. Unfortunately, Governor Cuomo [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=15.68s)]
*  barely used it. If he would have used it for our great seniors, he wouldn't have caused the death [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=21.84s)]
*  of 11,000 people, seniors, and 40,000 people overall. Buckle up, folks. It's five o'clock in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=26.96s)]
*  New York. Get ready for a tangled web of what, from the public reporting from the outside, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  appears to be more of Donald Trump's efforts at retribution and weaponization of the United [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=41.04s)]
*  States Department of Justice. Back in 2020, then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Donald Trump [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=47.36s)]
*  sparred frequently and heatedly over each other's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=54.08s)]
*  Fast forward to 2025. Cuomo, after having resigned from the governorship nearly four years ago, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=61.68s)]
*  after claims of sexual harassment, claims that he denies, is a current frontrunner in New York [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=67.84s)]
*  City's mayoral race. Meanwhile, it just so happens that last month, DOJ opened a criminal [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=73.84s)]
*  investigation into Cuomo over testimony he gave to Congress last year about COVID. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=78.96s)]
*  Cuomo's spokesperson questioned the timing of the news. We have never been informed of any such matter, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  so why would someone leak it now? The answer is obvious. This is lawfare and election interference, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  plain and simple, something Trump and his top DOJ officials say they are against. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=97.83999999999999s)]
*  New York Times reports it like this. Quote, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=102.8s)]
*  Now, to add more texture to the web of connections between Trump's DOJ and this New York City mayoral [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=108.96s)]
*  race, Cuomo's opponent is the current New York City mayor, Eric Adams. Adams was indicted last [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=124.08s)]
*  year on federal corruption charges, yet those charges were dropped when Trump's DOJ ordered [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=130.72s)]
*  prosecutors to dismiss the case. Several career prosecutors who took issue with that order were [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=136.96s)]
*  fired or quit in dramatic protests with scathing rebukes of the current DOJ leaders. All while [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  another person currently targeted by the Trump Justice Department, Congresswoman LaMonica McIver, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=150.56s)]
*  appeared in court today after she was charged Monday with two counts of assaulting ICE officers [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  outside a New Jersey detention center. McIver has denied the charges and was released without [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  having to pay bail. The next hearing in her case will be held next month. Donald Trump's administration [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=168.24s)]
*  seeming to target its perceived political enemies is where we begin the hour with some of our [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=175.12s)]
*  favorite experts and friends. Former top official at the Department of Justice, MSNBC legal analyst, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=179.84s)]
*  Andrew Weissman's here. Also joining us, chief political columnist, host of the ImPolitik podcast [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=185.52s)]
*  for PUC, my friend, MSNBC national affairs analyst, John Heilman's back. With me at the table over the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=190.96s)]
*  hour watching me cough is Democratic strategist, professor at Columbia University, MSNBC political [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=196.88s)]
*  analyst, Basil Smigiel. Basil, I felt you. You're impulse to jump in and read the teleprompter for [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  me. Next time we'll work it out in advance. There's so many layers to this. I mean, let's start with [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=207.28s)]
*  the New York piece. Trump is so obsessed and he now seems to have his fingers on the scale in a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  million different ways. Can I just start out by letting everybody know that there are a lot of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=219.12s)]
*  good people running for mayor of the city of New York that are not under investigation. People should [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=224.8s)]
*  know that. Number one. Number two, yes, you talked about retribution, retribution and reclamation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=229.28s)]
*  That is seemingly what this Department of Justice under Donald Trump is all about. You should also [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=235.68s)]
*  include Tish James in the mix, right? She's being investigated as well. And if you even go back to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=241.52s)]
*  the- And Alvin Bragg too. I think he's being harassed. And if you go back to the sort of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=246.4s)]
*  Fannie Willis, that whole debacle that played out when he was being investigated in Georgia, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  that was done really to just minimize her and get rid of her credibility. And I think that's really [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=255.84s)]
*  the bottom line here. That it's not just about weaponizing the department. It's about stripping [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=262.88s)]
*  the credibility of anyone who seems like a formidable sort of spokesperson against him. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=268.16s)]
*  And if you remember in COVID, during COVID in 2020, it was what Trump said and then it was what [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=274.64s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo had to say, right? Everybody in America was sort of tuned into how was New York [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=279.84s)]
*  handling this? Because they at least seem to have a good understanding of, if not how this came about, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=285.12s)]
*  but certainly how to move forward. What he's being investigated for is real, right? These- [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=292.0s)]
*  There are worse deaths at nursing homes and that is a real issue that needs a good answer and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=299.2s)]
*  solution too. But the fact that this happens now at a time when he's doing so well in the polls, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=306.0s)]
*  number one. And number two, the sitting mayor had his charges dismissed. One wonders, was this part [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=314.0s)]
*  of that deal. You have to stay in the race, but in order for him to do that, you've got to find a way [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=321.44s)]
*  to get it to bring down Andrew Cuomo's numbers. In one way, shape or form, it seems like Donald [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=327.68s)]
*  Trump wants to have control, not just of national politics from DC, but also micromanage even what's [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=333.6s)]
*  happening in the city of New York. How do you think New Yorkers respond? Yeah, interesting, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=340.72s)]
*  because we have this rank choice voting thing. Our primary is next month, June 24th, I believe. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  My guess is that voters that decide to vote for Andrew Cuomo are doing so because they really want [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=352.96s)]
*  to vote for Andrew Cuomo and they know about the nursing homes scandal. They know about the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=357.84s)]
*  allegations that- the MeToo allegations from Tish James and they've decided they really want to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=363.04s)]
*  focus on what's happening right now in New York and they're willing to vote for him for that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  But there are a lot of progressives that are running that have actually campaigned against [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=372.56s)]
*  him and saying that New Yorkers should not even rank him. I imagine that that campaign [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=378.4s)]
*  is going to get a lot more ammunition now because of this additional investigation. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=383.2s)]
*  And let me just say very quickly, I think what New Yorkers really need is a mayor who is not [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=388.32s)]
*  under investigation. I have to say that again. I have to say that again. Because there's so much [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=395.84s)]
*  going on in the city, so many ways in which New Yorkers want to be part of the defense against [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=400.32s)]
*  what's coming out of DC, that they want someone who's actually going to be present and standing [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=406.48s)]
*  up for them. They seem to be disappointed with the current mayor. It remains to be seen how [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=411.52000000000004s)]
*  disappointed they'll be in Andrew Cuomo should this investigation continue. Andrew Weissman, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=416.48s)]
*  how do you see this? So I really agree with this idea that you have to sort of keep two things in [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=421.92s)]
*  mind here, that you could have a legitimate investigation into a member of Congress if that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=429.2s)]
*  person did assault a federal officer. And you could have a legitimate investigation into [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=437.52s)]
*  the then governor for testifying falsely. It remains to be seen whether anything comes [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=446.08s)]
*  of those investigations, whether they can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=453.2s)]
*  Those are potentially legitimate. The issue is the context. Because let me just give you an [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=458.4s)]
*  example. Todd Blanch, the number two in the Department of Justice, said about the charge [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=465.76s)]
*  with respect to the member of Congress, we take very seriously assaulting a federal officer. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=471.28s)]
*  Really? Day one of this administration was the pardoning of everyone involved in the January 6 [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=477.84s)]
*  assaults on the Capitol, including physical attacks on Capitol Police. So the hypocrisy [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  is so prevalent. And the same thing with respect to Andrew Cuomo, as you point out, the idea that [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=491.44s)]
*  you're going to dismiss the charges against Eric Adams because you really care about public [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=497.76s)]
*  corruption, so much so that you're going to go after Andrew Cuomo but not Eric Adams. So the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=505.28s)]
*  hypocrisy is the thing that makes it so plain that this is weaponization. But you do have to keep [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=511.84s)]
*  those sort of distinct because it doesn't mean that the people be under investigation, did nothing [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  wrong. It's just clear that they're being targeted because of weaponization by this administration. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=525.04s)]
*  you [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrsmTHVVcs&t=535.28s)]
