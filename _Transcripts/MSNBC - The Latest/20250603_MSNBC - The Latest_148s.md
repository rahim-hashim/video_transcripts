# Newark mayor sues Alina Habba over arrest at ICE facility and dropped charges
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo)
*  The Newark mayor now sues the DOJ's top prosecutor in the state. Mayor Roz Baraka alleges Alina [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=0.0s)]
*  Haba violated his constitutional rights when he was arrested and charged with trespassing, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=6.48s)]
*  stemming from that visit to an ICE facility last month. The charges were later dropped, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=12.0s)]
*  a judge calling the DOJ's dismissal of the case a, quote, embarrassing retraction. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=16.8s)]
*  MSNBC legal analyst Catherine Christian is back with us and now joining us as well. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  NBC's Ryan Reilly. Ryan, lay out the details of this lawsuit. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=26.24s)]
*  Yeah, essentially what the lawsuit alleges is that Alina Haba was acting as this political [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=29.52s)]
*  actor and cites a lot of these statements that she made criticizing the Democratic leadership [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=34.32s)]
*  of New Jersey, making these proclamations about this case and, you know, asserting these facts [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=39.36s)]
*  that the mayor contends are not true. And, you know, I think that the judge's words when that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  case was dismissed are really part of the center of this lawsuit. You know, the judge was pretty [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=49.84s)]
*  explicit saying that the prosecutor had a responsibility to not act as a political actor [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=55.12s)]
*  and to go forward with the facts as they were the true facts instead of making a political case [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  because their obligations are to the law and not to any politics. There's a quote here from the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=69.6s)]
*  case saying that this arrest subjected him to false arrest and malicious prosecution in violation [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=75.36s)]
*  of his constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment and also brought an action for [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=81.28s)]
*  defamation against Haba because of those statements that she made on social media before, of course, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=86.0s)]
*  this case was retracted. Remember, this case wasn't brought by a lying prosecutor within the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=91.68s)]
*  U.S. Attorney's Office. It typically would be brought by an assistant U.S. attorney. This was [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=96.0s)]
*  someone who was hired into a role as essentially a deputy to Haba who was appointed as the interim [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=99.44s)]
*  U.S. attorney for New Jersey. It was someone who had previous experience as a federal prosecutor [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=107.36s)]
*  but was brought into this high-ranking role, and that's very unusual to have a high-ranking [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=112.56s)]
*  person who's an assistant, an aide to the U.S. attorney for New Jersey directly prosecuting, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=117.28s)]
*  you know, this sort of low-level what would be misdemeanor, what had been a misdemeanor case. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=124.4s)]
*  you [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNlneQaPlo&t=137.36s)]
