# Wall Street Update: Stocks bounce back following sharp sell-off yesterday
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8)
*  I say, now to Wall Street, where the markets are trying to rebound from yesterday's major [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=0.0s)]
*  sell-off triggered by President Trump's continued attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=3.96s)]
*  Right now, the Dow is up, and it's up substantially, up more than 2.7 percent, more than 1,000 [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=9.32s)]
*  points up. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=16.36s)]
*  This, however, is the result of very fluctuating days that we see, oftentimes hours, in the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=17.36s)]
*  Dow Jones. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=26.04s)]
*  Adding to some of the anxiety that the international markets are feeling is the International Monetary [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=27.68s)]
*  Fund just slashed the U.S. growth forecast to 1.8 percent in 2025. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=33.4s)]
*  That's nearly a full percentage point lower than the estimate from just January. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=38.68s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC's senior business correspondent Christine Romans and NBC White House correspondent [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=44.32s)]
*  Gabe Gutierrez. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=48.92s)]
*  So, Christine, what's the reason for the IMF's downgrade and then all of a sudden we're up [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=49.92s)]
*  1,000 points in the Dow Jones right now? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, stock up on the drama mean, I think, is what we can say here, because CSIC is how [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=57.4s)]
*  a lot of investors feel, and it's been like this for weeks now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  The IMF downgrade, that is simply because of the shock, it used the word shock, of the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=64.0s)]
*  April 2nd announcement at the Rose Garden when the president announced what it calls [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=68.64s)]
*  these reciprocal tariffs. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=72.36s)]
*  They were big, they were dramatic. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=73.78s)]
*  Even the pause on the worst of them has created uncertainty that has caused them to dramatically [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=76.22s)]
*  lower their expectations for U.S. growth. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=81.38s)]
*  U.S. growth now at just 1.8 percent for this year, far below, a whole point below growth [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=84.72s)]
*  it expects for the rest of the world. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=88.16s)]
*  So it is the IMF not using the words self-inflicted wound, but when you read between the lines [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=89.72s)]
*  and see what it's saying about the trade strategy, that's the reason for the downgrade for growth [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=95.7s)]
*  here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  And then there's also, Gabe, the whole issue of the president vis-à-vis Fed Chair Powell. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  What's the president saying today about Powell? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=107.1s)]
*  It's not clear whether the president could actually fire him, even if he wanted to. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=110.32s)]
*  Well, Jose, legal experts say he can't, but there is a question that the Supreme Court [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=114.52s)]
*  is weighing whether to take up certain cases that may give the president more power to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=118.52s)]
*  fire independent agency heads. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=124.08s)]
*  But at this point, the president himself has stopped short of actually saying he would [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=126.24s)]
*  fire Jerome Powell, although last week on Friday, his top economic adviser Kevin Hassett [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=130.48s)]
*  said that the president and his team were continuing to study the issue. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=138.4s)]
*  Still, as you said, the president still hasn't, he hasn't said that he would actually fire [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  Powell, who, by the way, he appointed during his first term, but he has been ramping up [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=149.28s)]
*  those attacks, Jose, calling him a loser, yesterday. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=154.36s)]
*  So Christine, how is that playing a part in all of this that we've been seeing in Dow [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=159.0s)]
*  and just world markets? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  It layers more uncertainty onto everything. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=166.98s)]
*  I mean, the Fed is designed to be an independent body, separate from political whims and the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=169.14s)]
*  pressures on a president. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=175.06s)]
*  Of course he wants lower interest rates. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=176.26s)]
*  All presidents would like the Fed to tweak interest rates so that it would make things [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=178.45999999999998s)]
*  better for them in the near term. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=182.0s)]
*  But that's not what the Fed is supposed to do. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=184.0s)]
*  It is supposed to look at maximum employment and inflation around 2 percent. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  Those are its goals. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=190.42s)]
*  And it doesn't think it's the right time to be lowering interest rates without inflation [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=191.78s)]
*  certainly under control here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=195.06s)]
*  So you have this push-pull here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=196.78s)]
*  There are those, in fact, even a news story in the Wall Street Journal today, essentially [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=198.58s)]
*  saying the president looks like he's trying to find somebody to blame for an economic [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=202.46s)]
*  downturn because of his own trade policies, blame it on Powell for not lowering interest [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=206.9s)]
*  rates soon enough. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=211.14s)]
*  So that's, I think, what you're seeing set up here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=212.7s)]
*  And I agree with Gabe that most experts say, legal experts say, he can't fire the Fed chief. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=216.1s)]
*  But the White House has said, well, they're looking into that option anyway. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=221.78s)]
*  And Christine, with all of this uncertainty, you look at gold and it's just breaking records [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=225.52s)]
*  almost every day. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  What you're seeing, they're calling it a sell-America trade. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=233.24s)]
*  And that is scary for investors because what it means, they're so alarmed by all of this [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=237.46s)]
*  over the past four or five weeks that they are buying gold, they are selling American [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=242.36s)]
*  stocks, American bonds, the American dollar, in a way that usually when there's uncertainty [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=248.12s)]
*  and chaos, the U.S. is the safe haven. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=254.84s)]
*  This time, at least so far, the U.S. is not the safe haven. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=257.68s)]
*  And that's getting an awful lot of attention. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=261.6s)]
*  It's sort of a reordering, and that has big ramifications with the U.S., the U.S. financial [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=263.8s)]
*  system. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=268.12s)]
*  And in fact, the U.S. bond market is kind of the center, the oxygen of the entire global [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=269.12s)]
*  financial system. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=271.56s)]
*  So these are big changes underway here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=272.72s)]
*  You're going to see a lot of, I think, this volatility in the days and weeks ahead. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=276.12s)]
*  And, Gabe, do we have any update or indication as to how negotiations, conversations between [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=280.64000000000004s)]
*  the executive, the president of the United States, and other countries on this issue [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  of tariffs have been going? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=290.6s)]
*  Well, Jose, Vice President J.D. Vance earlier today said that there has been progress made [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=293.04s)]
*  on trade talks with India. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=299.64000000000004s)]
*  But so far, no final deal has been struck on any of these tariffs, even though for the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  last several days we have heard the White House talking about how at least 15 countries [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=306.92s)]
*  have put in offers when it comes to a potential trade deal. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=311.8s)]
*  But still, no final deal yet, although progress has been made on India. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  And the administration says it has been talking to several countries, including Mexico, for [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  example, and South Korea and Japan as well, Jose. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=326.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gW0ex-aqj8&t=336.92s)]
