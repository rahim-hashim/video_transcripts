# Perception of ‘Russian invincibility’ has ‘changed’ after Ukraine attacks bombers: Journalist
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y)
*  This morning, a new round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine have just wrapped up. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  This was the second meeting between the two warring countries in less than three weeks. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  And today's talks come on the heels of a weakened Ukrainian offensive, one of the largest, the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=10.36s)]
*  most audacious since the start of the war. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=15.96s)]
*  Ukraine's military striking dozens of Russian aircraft after smuggling drones on flatbed [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=19.52s)]
*  trucks deep inside Russian territory. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  The operation code-named SpiderWeb. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=26.92s)]
*  Spring in NBC News chief international correspondent, Keir Simmons and Michael Weiss, editor with [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=29.64s)]
*  the insider. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=34.56s)]
*  Keir, what more do we know about Operation SpiderWeb and how it may have impacted today's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=35.56s)]
*  talks? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=41.04s)]
*  Well, interestingly, the timing appears to be more kind of intelligence and military [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=42.04s)]
*  driven than necessarily political because the Ukrainians are saying that it took 18 [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=49.08s)]
*  months to get to the point where they were able to to carry this off. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=53.36s)]
*  They hit, as you mentioned, around a third, they say, of Russia's strategic bombing capability. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=57.48s)]
*  These are nuclear capable bombers. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=65.48s)]
*  These are cruise missile carriers. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=68.12s)]
*  They are crucial to Russia's capability to strike Ukraine long distance. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=71.08s)]
*  They were a long way away from Ukraine. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=76.72s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons, I suspect, why they were unguarded. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  They were not in protected hangars. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=82.12s)]
*  And you have this extraordinary videos of them, at least some of them on fire. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=85.16s)]
*  We will find out more, I think, in the days to come about just how much damage was done [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=89.0s)]
*  to just how many. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  It is like a spy thriller. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=97.0s)]
*  Ukraine saying that it snuck people into Russia and that they carried this out and then they [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=99.64s)]
*  managed to get them out again. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=105.8s)]
*  And Ukraine almost crowing. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  President Zelensky saying, and we've no way of verifying this, of course, that the headquarters [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=109.16s)]
*  of the operation to carry this out was right next door to an FSB office, to a Russian FSB [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=114.28s)]
*  office, which is, of course, the former KGB, kind of poking fun in a certain way at Moscow [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=119.24s)]
*  and Putin. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=124.96s)]
*  The impact on the talks today, they were very brief. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=125.96s)]
*  They agreed, according to Ukraine, to exchange more prisoners. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=128.72s)]
*  But there's no sign of a ceasefire. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=133.64s)]
*  And I just think what happened over the weekend just underscores that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=134.64s)]
*  The Russians, of course, in recent weeks have carried out huge bombing campaigns against [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=137.72s)]
*  Ukraine, even while these talks were taking place. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=142.72s)]
*  And so the reality is, despite President Trump's ambition to see a ceasefire, that is not what [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=145.72s)]
*  you're seeing in terms of actions, frankly, on either side, no matter what either side [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=153.44s)]
*  says. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  And across Europe, we're seeing signs of European governments repositioning to back the Ukrainians. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  Overall, the picture is that there is very likely to be a lot more of this conflict before [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=168.68s)]
*  it comes to an end. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=175.0s)]
*  If anything, it seems like things are just escalating in terms of the violence and the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=176.0s)]
*  number of attacks and the strength of the attacks. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=179.72s)]
*  I know Zolensky calling this a brilliant result, this one and a half year operation, and really [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=182.44s)]
*  happy with how it ended up, at least for the Ukrainians, he's saying. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=187.68s)]
*  You called it their most long-range operation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=191.24s)]
*  You detailed some of the strategic challenges that they had to overcome in order to pull [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=193.48s)]
*  this off. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=198.67999999999998s)]
*  Kier Simmons, thank you for that reporting. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  Michael, this attack by Ukraine was bold. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=201.0s)]
*  It was significant. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=203.48s)]
*  Talk about the scale of the operation and what it means now about Russia's vulnerabilities. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=204.6s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, 18 months in planning, which means that the Ukrainians were doing [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=209.2s)]
*  this while Joe Biden was still president, and there's every likelihood they didn't [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=215.2s)]
*  read his administration into it either. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=218.32s)]
*  We know that Jake Sullivan, the former national security adviser, did not look with unmixed [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=221.0s)]
*  delight on some of Ukraine's kinetic military intelligence operations, including the assassination [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=225.04s)]
*  of generals, Daria Dugina, who was the daughter of Russia's foremost fascist propagandist, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=229.68s)]
*  Alexander Dugin in central Moscow, and so on. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=235.84s)]
*  I mean, I remember being in Kiev in 2018 and interviewing the former head of Ukraine's [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=238.2s)]
*  military intelligence service, General Valeriy Konzachuk, who told me, and this doesn't [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=243.32s)]
*  get enough attention in the Western press. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=247.64s)]
*  He's like, Michael, we have the capability to strike inside Russian Federation territory, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=249.32s)]
*  let alone inside occupied areas of Ukraine. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=254.04s)]
*  There were all kinds of operations, including using car bombs to blow up separatist commanders [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=257.88s)]
*  in Donbass, Russian-backed insurgents and so on, that the United States told Kiev do [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=262.8s)]
*  not do for fear of escalation. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=269.34s)]
*  So if anything, the Americans tend to apply the brakes here. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=271.88s)]
*  But what we're seeing now, Anna, is that as America's influence and support for Ukraine [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=275.76s)]
*  wanes, Ukraine's boldness and its, frankly, desire to operate completely autonomously [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  and independent of asking permission or begging forgiveness from Washington is also going [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=286.12s)]
*  to increase. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=291.84s)]
*  And I mean, yeah, they took out as much as a third of Russia's strategic bombers, including, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=292.84s)]
*  I'm hearing, two A-50s. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=297.64s)]
*  These are non-replaceable, irreplaceable, cannot be remanufactured by the Russian Federation, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=299.8s)]
*  the equivalent of AWACS, basically. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=306.92s)]
*  They've only got six of them, according to GUR, Ukraine's military intelligence service. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=309.24s)]
*  So take out a third of Russia's fleet of A-50s overnight. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  So it's a pretty good scalp for the Ukrainians. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=318.24s)]
*  Yeah, and Ukrainians are taking a massive victory lap publicly. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=320.6s)]
*  We aren't hearing much from the Russian side at this point. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=325.22s)]
*  I mean, I think that the Western analysts have called this a humiliation for Putin. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=328.92s)]
*  It was unclear just how serious he was before these talks today, before these attacks. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=332.68s)]
*  What's the likelihood that he's going to engage in any kind of a peace talk after this attack now? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, look, his ambitions have remained unchanged. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=345.24s)]
*  He wants all of Ukraine. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=348.36s)]
*  So he either wants to take it militarily, which he cannot do, or capture it politically, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=349.36s)]
*  which he thinks he might be able to do with a more pliant or malleable U.S. government [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=353.6s)]
*  led by Donald Trump. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=358.56s)]
*  The starting point for Russia's negotiations in Turkey are we want regime change. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=360.76s)]
*  So Zelensky is out. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=365.52s)]
*  Then we want Ukraine to be completely demilitarized, which is the opposite of what's happening. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=367.04s)]
*  I mean, this was a homegrown capability. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=371.32s)]
*  This fleet of drones that they've manufactured, 40 percent of Ukraine's defense capability [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=374.12s)]
*  is domestically sourced. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=378.8s)]
*  So this is becoming one of the most hyperactive military powers in Europe. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=380.24s)]
*  And then finally, Putin wants to really re-litigate the post-Cold War NATO security architecture. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=384.5s)]
*  He wants troops, particularly American troops, withdrawn from the eastern flank, including [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=389.54s)]
*  the Baltic states. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=393.94s)]
*  So these ambitions have not changed. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=394.94s)]
*  I think what has changed, though, is the perception of Russian indomitability and invincibility. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=397.18s)]
*  I mean, this is one of the most heavily invigilated countries on the planet, the FSB, as Kier [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=402.82s)]
*  mentioned. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=407.46s)]
*  They're the border guard. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=408.46s)]
*  They control the borders, what gets in and what gets out. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=409.46s)]
*  And again, alluding to what General Kondratchuk told me several years ago, the Ukrainians [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=411.42s)]
*  are proving to be expert at not only running operations inside Russian territory—these [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=415.54s)]
*  drones, by the way, according to the reporting, were constructed in Russia and, again, you [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=420.18s)]
*  know, emplaced in those concealed compartments and then put on lorries and driven within [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=425.38s)]
*  striking distance of four different airfields, thousands and thousands of miles away from [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=429.74s)]
*  one another. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=434.42s)]
*  It's pretty incredible. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=435.42s)]
*  And that probably indicates, or it certainly indicates to me, that Ukraine was able to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=436.42s)]
*  recruit local assets inside Russia. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=440.0s)]
*  Now, that's got to be a terrifying prospect to Putin, who spent the first 20 years of [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=442.24s)]
*  his dictatorship essentially recreating Fortress Russia. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=446.6s)]
*  You know, the old KGB, the nickname for it was the Sword and the Shield. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=449.72s)]
*  Well, if the Shield has cracks in it this wide, what does that mean about the stability [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=453.84s)]
*  of his regime? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=459.16s)]
*  And, I mean, you're going to have members of the Ukrainian—I'm sorry, the Russian [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=460.16s)]
*  special services, who are going to be incredibly paranoid and incredibly wary. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=463.92s)]
*  In fact, I'm just seeing today indications that traffic in Russia is now being held [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=468.36s)]
*  up. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=473.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=474.44s)]
*  Because the FSB and the law enforcement agencies are now searching every truck to make sure [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbhLxbwUV5Y&t=475.44s)]
