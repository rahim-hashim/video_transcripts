# Musk demoted as he loses over $100 BILLION in 100 Days: Ari Melber’s report on Trump slump
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA)
*  The special report drawing on an American tradition you know, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=0.0s)]
*  looking at the results of a president's first 100 days in office. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=4.0s)]
*  We are now on the eve of Trump's first 100 days, a busy, sometimes chaotic period, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=7.4s)]
*  not only for him as a president, if you follow news and politics, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=12.4s)]
*  but really a chaotic period for the country at times, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=16.0s)]
*  dealing with his choices and actions as president. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=19.6s)]
*  This benchmark dates back to FDR's sort of high-water mark for a productive first 100 days. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=23.2s)]
*  President Roosevelt combating the Depression with over a dozen pieces of major legislation [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=29.0s)]
*  that ranged from banking reform to jobs programs. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=33.6s)]
*  It was big, assertive, effective leadership, historians would ultimately say, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=37.2s)]
*  for a big time, a test of the country, of the economy, of what America was going to be. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=43.2s)]
*  But he did something that goes beyond just that particular era. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=50.2s)]
*  And I say this as introduction here, FDR capitalized on his election mandate. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=54.0s)]
*  And that's really what made it a governing tradition, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=59.0s)]
*  even if we sort of know 100 days is a made-up thing, right? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=61.4s)]
*  It could be 110, it could be 120. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=64.0s)]
*  But it matters, and every president won't live up to FDR, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=67.0s)]
*  but it's a Washington tradition because that political town and the other branches of government know [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=70.0s)]
*  100 days are the best opening period for a president to get things done. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=77.2s)]
*  Now, I can tell you Trump's first 100 days is a long way from FDR's record. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=82.2s)]
*  This year, for all the headlines, the crises, or the bluster, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=87.4s)]
*  we're going to look right now at the objective facts and results about these 99 days, 100, beginning tomorrow. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=91.0s)]
*  We're going to focus on key areas of this president's leadership, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=98.4s)]
*  his priority policy of immigration, something he says he should be judged on, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=102.2s)]
*  his clashes over the rule of law, and of course, the economy where the Trump administration is faced. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=106.0s)]
*  The most sweeping problems and a very costly rejection of its trade war. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=111.4s)]
*  This also is the very issue where candidate Trump vowed to focus his second term governance, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  vowing to slash prices and inflation. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  I will immediately bring prices down starting on day one. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=127.0s)]
*  I'll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=130.4s)]
*  If I'm president-elect, I'll get it done before even becoming president. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=134.4s)]
*  But if I win, we will rapidly defeat inflation. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=139.2s)]
*  Look at what's going on in the Middle East. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  This would have never happened. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=145.0s)]
*  I will get that settled and fast. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=146.6s)]
*  Starting the day I take the oath of office, I will rapidly drive prices down and we will make America affordable again. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=148.6s)]
*  Rapidly drive the prices down. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  A twist on his well-known campaign slogan, which is familiar and well-known because he plagiarized it from Ronald Reagan, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=160.6s)]
*  make America great again, make America affordable again. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=166.4s)]
*  Well, by this January, inflation was already cooling. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=170.4s)]
*  Stocks were surging. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=173.0s)]
*  The U.S. economy was the envy of the world, as the economist put it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=174.0s)]
*  And Trump took that economy and began with big tariffs on our trading neighbors, Canada and Mexico, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  continued to pile on more tariffs and what Murdoch's Wall Street Journal dubbed the dumbest trade war in history. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=183.6s)]
*  Those tariffs rapidly wiped out trillions. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=189.4s)]
*  Markets lost about 9 percent. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=192.4s)]
*  Trump then retreating partly after blowback, then re-upping aspects of his trade war. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=194.4s)]
*  They charge us, we charge them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=201.8s)]
*  This, I think fair to say, is worse than the worst-case scenario of the tariffs. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=203.4s)]
*  Burning down the house to cook a steak. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=209.6s)]
*  Economic Armageddon. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=212.4s)]
*  Trump's trade war wiping trillions of dollars in value from these markets. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=214.4s)]
*  I know very few people, very few people, I can probably count them on a hand, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  who think that this is a good idea. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=223.0s)]
*  The president paused his additional tariffs on dozens of our trading partners for the next 90 days. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=225.6s)]
*  Now, 90 days may not seem like a long time, but remember Trump has only been president for 82 days. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=231.0s)]
*  And it already feels like a goddamn decade. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=238.0s)]
*  Who can relate? So, 70, 80, 90 days in, it can feel like a long time. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=243.6s)]
*  That's definitely true for the largest companies in America. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=250.0s)]
*  The drop was huge for them, about 9 percent. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=252.6s)]
*  Compare that to the exact same benchmark across other presidents' first 100 days. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=255.6s)]
*  Look at this, because these are facts. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=262.6s)]
*  I'm going to leave it up for a second. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=264.6s)]
*  If you start in the middle there, Obama up 8 percent. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=267.0s)]
*  Biden up over 10 percent, partly because there was a brewing economic rebound, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=270.8s)]
*  and partly because he didn't mess with it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=276.6s)]
*  In other words, you can take the macroeconomic wins and ride them. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=279.0s)]
*  Look at the right-hand part of your screen. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=282.6s)]
*  Down over 8 percent in 100 days, the worst record in this semi-modern era. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=284.8s)]
*  And much of that, according to all the data we have and the economic analysts, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=290.6s)]
*  Wall Street CEOs and everyone else saying it was a direct response to Trump, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=295.8s)]
*  not a random bad piece of luck, but an 8.6 percent multi-trillion dollar rejection [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=299.4s)]
*  of what Wall Street calls his failed trade war. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=306.2s)]
*  That's the numbers, the data, the facts. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=310.0s)]
*  Numbers don't lie. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=312.4s)]
*  That's not an opinion about the policies. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=314.2s)]
*  It is the result. He vowed a better economy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  He vowed lower prices and talked a lot about the markets. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  We're going to be happy with him. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=321.4s)]
*  But launch policies that you see on your screen are bringing forth the opposite. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  Normally, Republican-friendly business leaders now say it could get even worse [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=327.2s)]
*  than what you see in that red line on your screen [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=330.4s)]
*  because the Trump recession could be coming. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  And politics has polling and snapshots of public views. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=334.8s)]
*  The economy, though, has its own type of measurements. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=337.6s)]
*  We have consumer sentiment under Trump hitting nearly all-time lows. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=340.2s)]
*  People are anxious or worse feeling about this. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=344.2s)]
*  Now, the Biden presidency was saddled by those price and inflation worries. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=347.6s)]
*  So no one's saying that there haven't been problems in our economy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  You can go to the inequality that has been getting worse for decades. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  You can go to the COVID disruptions. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  But life is usually compared to what? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  So Americans resented the COVID inflation that Biden oversaw. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=364.4s)]
*  Now, they're even more upset and resentful of Trump's trade war, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=367.79999999999995s)]
*  the slumping markets, the impact on small businesses and their daily life. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=372.4s)]
*  Because on top of all that, they still have a price problem. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=376.4s)]
*  Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, things people tend to buy to feed their families [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=378.79999999999995s)]
*  are seeing prices continue on. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=383.0s)]
*  That's from Trump's third month here in the 100 days. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=384.4s)]
*  Other price hikes and surging inflation will continue with the tariffs [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=388.0s)]
*  unless and until he really rolls them back further. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=391.0s)]
*  That's what the data shows. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=393.4s)]
*  Now, then 100 days is a time as well to get bills passed. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=395.79999999999995s)]
*  The honeymoon I mentioned. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  If presidents win a Congress, it's usually a legislative blitz [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=401.2s)]
*  because they have momentum and control of two branches of government. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, here, I told you we'd show you the facts. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  Here they are. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=411.2s)]
*  President Trump coming up short on that score as well. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=411.79999999999995s)]
*  Look at all of the ways people got bills passed, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=416.0s)]
*  sometimes with divided or united government, but a lot. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=418.79999999999995s)]
*  Even in the first term, Trump worked to get a bunch passed, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=422.0s)]
*  but this time he is coming in low. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=424.4s)]
*  Five laws, none are major legislation on par with, say, FDR's economic reforms. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=427.4s)]
*  Or remember when Obama passed the stimulus coming into the financial crisis era? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=431.8s)]
*  That allocated over $700 billion to juice the economy, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=437.0s)]
*  and he passed it early in the 100 days in February. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=440.4s)]
*  But Trump is effectively inactive with this Congress. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=443.4s)]
*  Now, that's bad news for MAGA fans who want MAGA priorities to last, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=446.4s)]
*  to be written into our long-term laws on the books. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=452.0s)]
*  Because remember, while other presidential actions can be significant, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=455.4s)]
*  they can be reversed by a future president if they're just executive policy, not a law. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=458.4s)]
*  And Trump is famously leaning more on executive orders this time [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=464.79999999999995s)]
*  than past presidents, including his first term. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=467.79999999999995s)]
*  This is a significant shift in how he views the presidency. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=470.79999999999995s)]
*  And you can see there in this comparison just how different it is in these 100 days. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=474.2s)]
*  But the orders also are a weaker part of a president's arsenal, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=478.8s)]
*  because as mentioned, they can be reversed just by the next president. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=482.4s)]
*  And if you try to do too much through that instead of working through Congress, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=486.0s)]
*  courts tend to narrow those efforts. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=489.2s)]
*  Indeed, the entire Musk set of cuts use executive powers, his proverbial chainsaw, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=492.2s)]
*  to try to slash temporary spending. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=499.8s)]
*  None of that has involved going down to Congress and actually having some long-term change in the laws yet, maybe ever. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=502.8s)]
*  And that's, again, bad news for folks if they want that stuff to last, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=510.6s)]
*  because courts have blocked some of the Musk-related bids, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=513.6s)]
*  whether it's trying to oust different rules or destroy USAID. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=516.6s)]
*  Again, you could pass a law changing or eliminating USAID, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=521.2s)]
*  but just trying to do it through this fiat means it's less effective in the long run. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=526.0s)]
*  Musk has talked about saving $150 billion lower than the earlier claims. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=531.6s)]
*  I think we could do at least $2 trillion. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=539.6s)]
*  I think we'll try for $2 trillion. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=541.6s)]
*  I think that's like the best-case outcome. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=545.6s)]
*  But I do think that you kind of have to have some overage. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=548.4s)]
*  I think if we try for $2 trillion, we've got a good shot at getting one. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=551.8000000000001s)]
*  We can actually find $1 trillion in savings. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=554.8000000000001s)]
*  That would be roughly 15% of the $7 trillion budget. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=558.4s)]
*  I'm excited to announce that we anticipate savings in FY26 from reduction of waste and fraud by $150 billion. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=562.1999999999999s)]
*  A lot of announcements, a lot of talk, a lot of meetings. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=572.0s)]
*  This is someone who is in business and made it his business to buy a giant social media platform [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=574.1999999999999s)]
*  where he is very focused on messaging and marketing. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=579.8s)]
*  But unlike most serious people in government who do cuts, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=583.4s)]
*  and there are a lot of Republicans who have advocated for smaller government [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=587.0s)]
*  and actually proposed budgets to show you what it would look like over the long haul, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=590.2s)]
*  Musk has basically given few details about this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=594.8s)]
*  The Times reports he gave no identifying details on the majority of them after they did an accounting. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=597.8s)]
*  But there's the conflict of interest that he has been trying to hawk Tesla's from his struggling company on the White House lawn, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=603.8s)]
*  violating pledges that he and the president made about a conflict. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=610.2s)]
*  And even that hasn't actually yet enriched him the way he might have hoped. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=613.6s)]
*  To the contrary, financially the biggest loser of money is Elon Musk and everyone [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=617.2s)]
*  because he's also the richest and maybe had the most to lose, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=624.4s)]
*  but he's down over $122 billion as we approach this magical 100-day mark tomorrow. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  That means Elon Musk has been losing over a billion dollars a day. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=633.6s)]
*  From a market perspective, I guess his allies might wonder how much worse would he be doing [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=640.4s)]
*  if he didn't have all of these insider relationships and access and White House marketing events. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=644.1999999999999s)]
*  But it's a lot of lost money. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=652.0s)]
*  So this is the economic piece. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=654.8s)]
*  It's not the only thing going on, but it's affected the largest number of people the quickest. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=657.0s)]
*  And if Donald Trump had done the opposite, if the markets were up 9%, 10%, we'd be telling you that. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=661.6s)]
*  It's just not the case. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=669.2s)]
*  And that brings us to the other reckoning that we are seeing as we approach 100 days tomorrow, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=671.2s)]
*  which is in a time where people are more upset about Trump's policies, trade war, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=676.0s)]
*  and entire set of priorities downing the markets, breaking campaign promises to lower prices that he made. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=681.0s)]
*  That sets up a lot more scrutiny and adversity, quite frankly, for the other parts of his agenda, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  rewiring the way we do democracy, gutting the rule of law, trying to make agencies in the DOJ part of his partisan enforcement machine. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=694.8s)]
*  So right now, I'm just going to open up to listen to the whole country with the survey data we have, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=703.5999999999999s)]
*  including sources ranging from nonpartisan to Fox News to what Republicans think, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=708.8s)]
*  if you ask them specifically, and what we're hearing from the people 100 days in [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=715.0s)]
*  is a big, wide rejection of Trump's current governing priorities. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=720.4s)]
*  His approval crashing already to 39%, the worst in 80 years. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=725.8s)]
*  He's underwater by double digits across the board. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=730.6s)]
*  If you look specifically at Republicans, most of whom want him to succeed and liked some of what he did instead in the campaign in the first term, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=734.0s)]
*  this has been a radical departure from his campaign promises. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=743.0s)]
*  So half of Republicans say he's not focused on the right priorities. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=746.0s)]
*  Doesn't mean they're about to turn into liberals and vote Democrat. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=750.5s)]
*  They just think the first 100 days have not been what they wanted, especially after what they heard on the campaign trail. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=752.9s)]
*  Here's one Republican vet, Karl Rove. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=758.4s)]
*  When it gets to the economy, he is in very bad shape. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=762.2s)]
*  And it's not only that he's in the short term in bad shape. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=765.3s)]
*  There's also evidence in the poll that no matter even if he gets his way on certain things like tariffs, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=770.5s)]
*  that he's not good in the long run. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=775.9s)]
*  There's some very deep seated skepticism among ordinary Americans about the effect of the economy, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=777.6s)]
*  the president's economic policies, both in the short run and the long run. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=783.3s)]
*  That's Bush, veteran Rove. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=788.4s)]
*  And he's talking about how these things work, which is when the economy is good enough, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=789.5s)]
*  people often do tend to give a pass to more of what's happening in Washington. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=792.8s)]
*  They either don't have to pay attention to it or they say, well, things seem pretty good. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=797.1999999999999s)]
*  But what if things are going really poorly? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=801.9s)]
*  Things seem bad. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=804.0s)]
*  And then they look at other issues with a more skeptical eye. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=805.3s)]
*  What I'm reporting to you tonight is that's what we're hearing is happening. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=808.7s)]
*  Broad disapproval across other issues. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=812.2s)]
*  This is a Fox News poll. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=815.5s)]
*  And they asked about all these different things. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=817.5s)]
*  And as you can see, a majority disapprove of Trump on everything but border security. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=819.9s)]
*  The disapproval also goes across the country. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=826.5s)]
*  We hear about how we're divided, but he's underwater among all these groups. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=829.7s)]
*  And then there is the law. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=834.7s)]
*  The law, what is allowed, what is legal, what is just, has been a huge part of politics over the last decade. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=838.7s)]
*  On the right, you hear about what Trump calls weaponization and the claims that somehow they're out to get people based on ideology. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=847.3000000000001s)]
*  Among progressives, we've had a debate about policing and Black Lives Matter. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=853.9000000000001s)]
*  In Washington politics, there's a lot of discussion about recriminations and investigations and subpoenas and all of that. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=857.7s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=865.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's second term has had direct clashes with the Supreme Court and actually following the law more than any modern president, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=867.2s)]
*  except perhaps Nixon, but that was later than the 100 days. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=875.2s)]
*  There are over 200 different lawsuits against Trump. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=879.2s)]
*  If a frivolous lawsuit is filed, we don't count it here. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=882.7s)]
*  We're talking about areas where at least the evidence and allegations showed potential government overreach. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=886.2s)]
*  We've had all of the documentation of Trump's purges and retribution. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=893.2s)]
*  Whatever he accused of others in the government, the unfairness of weaponization I mentioned, he is doing it worse than we've ever seen. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=897.2s)]
*  And I have the evidence and case law on that to show you. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=905.2s)]
*  Musk's department, for example, went after government employees, so many different headlines, removals, purges, retaliation. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=908.7s)]
*  This is exactly the kind of thing that you don't want in a nonpartisan government. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=917.2s)]
*  Judges challenged some of this, froze some of it, dialed some of it back. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=922.2s)]
*  The efforts to dismantle agencies like the Department of Ed to access federal worker data, a huge conflict of interest for someone like Musk. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=926.2s)]
*  We've seen culture war attacks, we've seen against all kinds of groups based on how you might identify or whether you are part of diversity. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=934.2s)]
*  They have lost early skirmishes in those cases, partially blocked by federal judges. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=942.2s)]
*  And perhaps most consequential is the immigration agenda. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=947.2s)]
*  We've got just some of the high level cases where even though the president has broad powers, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=953.2s)]
*  you cannot just abuse immigration or war powers to snatch people up off the street or send them to the wrong foreign prison. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=958.2s)]
*  President Trump's promised mass deportation operation is now underway. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=969.2s)]
*  The Trump administration says it sent hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=972.2s)]
*  A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court ban on the deportation of hundreds of immigrants. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=977.2s)]
*  The Trump administration officials admitted to a quote, administrative error that they made when they deported a Maryland father. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=983.2s)]
*  That's up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That's not up to us. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=990.2s)]
*  How can I return him to the United States? Like I smuggle him into the United States or whatever it is. Of course I'm not going to do it. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=995.2s)]
*  We will never give up on you Kilmer. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1001.2s)]
*  The Supreme Court ordering the Trump administration to pause deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1003.2s)]
*  This is measurably the most we've ever seen an administration clash with the Supreme Court, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1008.2s)]
*  the highest law of the land, over whether they actually have to follow the law in modern history. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1017.2s)]
*  Nixon ultimately was pushed out of office over these kind of legal clashes that took much longer to foment. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1023.2s)]
*  But this is what we're seeing. And it matters because as I mentioned, the economic dynamic, the political dynamic, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1031.2s)]
*  Trump's crashing support may also affect whether people want to give him the benefit of the doubt when he's taking actions that not only the Supreme Court, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1037.2s)]
*  but every Trump appointee on the Supreme Court said, we're too far. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1044.2s)]
*  We had late in the 100 days, just within the last two weeks, that rare overnight weekend ruling that said against Trump, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1048.2s)]
*  you cannot take war powers to seize people and snatch them up. And we live in such a politicized time. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1056.2s)]
*  Maybe some people would say, well, if Kagan's against it, sounds like a bad idea. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1062.2s)]
*  Someone else might say, well, if Kavanaugh's against it, it might sound like a bad idea. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1068.2s)]
*  Well, how bad of a legal idea is it when they and seven members of the court, all Trump appointees are against it? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1072.2s)]
*  The immigration agenda is facing these setbacks, not because the courts have a problem with lowering the number of immigrants into this country. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1079.2s)]
*  That is fully allowed. They do have a problem with abusing powers or claiming we're at war when we're not. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1088.2s)]
*  Are we in the constitutional crisis? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1094.2s)]
*  Well, the Supreme Court will ultimately have to decide whether the Trump administration has done enough to follow its order to facilitate the return of that detainee Garcia. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1097.2s)]
*  The court may also take a closer look at ICE arrests of individuals whose lawyers say they're being targeted for their speech, like that Turkish national. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1108.2s)]
*  The pattern is students who repeatedly are linked to political speech. You're allowed to take positions against the U.S. government. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1117.2s)]
*  It's generally considered patriotic to use your free speech that way rather than just supporting the government. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1126.2s)]
*  You're supposed to be allowed to do either. And the question is, and it's not been resolved in all the courts yet, whether this government is abusing ICE powers to target those people. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MDat7IYHA&t=1131.2s)]
*  A broader crackdown on universities themselves trying to yank federal funding, a retribution tour against law firms themselves, many of whom are stacked with experienced government veterans who've worked at the DOJ, who've worked for conservative justices.
