# ‘The facts are on my side’: Rep. McIver touts confidence ahead of day in court with Trump’s DOJ
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78)
*  Last night, the Trump administration announced it's deploying 2,000 National Guard troops [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=0.0s)]
*  to Los Angeles following a second day of protests sparked by a series of ICE raids in local [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=5.32s)]
*  businesses. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=11.0s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom is condemning the troop deployment, calling it purposefully [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=12.0s)]
*  inflammatory and unnecessary. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  And needless to say, Attorney General Pam Bondi is already laying the groundwork for [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=19.72s)]
*  prosecutions aimed not just at protesters, but at anyone who stands in the administration's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=23.56s)]
*  way. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=29.36s)]
*  She tweeted, quote, It doesn't matter if you're a judge, a member of Congress or a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=30.36s)]
*  protester in Los Angeles, if you obstruct or assault a law enforcement officer, this [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=35.0s)]
*  Department of Justice will prosecute you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=39.72s)]
*  Case in point, the Trump administration is continuing its effort to prosecute New Jersey [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=43.0s)]
*  Democratic Representative Monica McIver over her attempt to conduct oversight at an ICE [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=47.6s)]
*  facility. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=53.68s)]
*  On Wednesday, she'll appear in court for a preliminary hearing where she faces charges [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=54.68s)]
*  of allegedly assaulting an officer during that oversight visit. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Despite House Republicans' move to censor and even expel her from Congress, Congresswoman [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  McIver isn't backing down, saying, quote, It's all about power and retaliation for the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=68.04s)]
*  Trump administration and the GOP. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm the next person on their list, but I'm not going to roll over. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=75.16s)]
*  Congresswoman Monica McIver joins us now. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=78.56s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=82.08s)]
*  So you're reviewing the case. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=84.36s)]
*  Really it comes down to about 30 seconds of a confused scrum. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=88.28s)]
*  And so you, after that happened, talk about that day. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=94.4s)]
*  Just give us a little bit of a timeline of how this chain of events. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=99.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=102.88s)]
*  First of all, thank you so much for having me. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=104.0s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be on with you all. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  We went there to conduct an oversight visit. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=107.88s)]
*  I mean, obviously, everyone knows as Congress members, what we would think everyone knows [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=109.96s)]
*  that we have the right to facilitate oversight visits at ICE facilities. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=113.8s)]
*  And I went there with my two of my colleagues, both Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=118.34s)]
*  who represent New Jersey. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=122.88s)]
*  We've done this before, literally just a couple of months before we went to a facility in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=124.88s)]
*  Elizabeth, not too far from Delaney Hall, conducting an oversight visit. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=129.64s)]
*  We were like pushed back a little bit, but we still got our tour, no conflict, not an [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=133.6s)]
*  army of officers to come help us do this visit. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=138.96s)]
*  And everything went smoothly. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=142.56s)]
*  And we were doing the same thing at this new facility at Delaney Hall. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  It had just opened up a couple of days before and they were receiving detainees. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=147.36s)]
*  And there had already been like kind of a back and forth if this facility was allowed [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=151.6s)]
*  to open up, if they had the right permits. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=155.04s)]
*  And so that's what we went there for, to check everything out, make sure the facility was [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=157.08s)]
*  up to par and to make sure detainees were being treated fairly and that they were getting [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=160.8s)]
*  their due right process there. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=165.24s)]
*  And so we went there, conflict broke out that was totally created by ICE agents and DHS. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=167.16s)]
*  Afterwards, we were given our tour, which was what we were there for after hours of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=173.56s)]
*  everything of waiting. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=178.16s)]
*  So the moments in question, they didn't take you and handcuffed you? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=179.48s)]
*  No. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=182.44s)]
*  You continued on your tour? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=183.44s)]
*  No, we continued on our tour. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=184.44s)]
*  They handcuffed and arrested the mayor, obviously, which is in every video for people to see [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=185.44s)]
*  outside of the facility they arrested him. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=190.32s)]
*  But after that, they took all three of us on our tour, offered us the beverage and we [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  were able to see the facility, which had some concerns. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=196.28s)]
*  And then also, too, we were able to speak to a few detainees about how they were not [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=199.44s)]
*  getting access to speak to their lawyers or they had not been able to have phone calls [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  or see any of their family members. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=207.32s)]
*  And so that is exactly what we went there for. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=209.29999999999998s)]
*  We didn't go there to protest or anything. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=211.56s)]
*  We went there literally to have an oversight visit. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=213.04s)]
*  And afterwards, we were planning on having a presser to talk with the public about what [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=215.64s)]
*  we actually saw. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=220.04s)]
*  And one of your tours. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=221.04s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=222.04s)]
*  I was talking about someone was speaking to me. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=223.04s)]
*  So later, a week went by and we got all this back and forth from our U.S. acting attorney, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=226.56s)]
*  Alina Habba. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=233.04s)]
*  But more so, I found out about the charges via Twitter. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  People started calling me, hey, I see something on Twitter. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  And I'm like, what's happening on Twitter? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=241.26s)]
*  I go on X, excuse me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=242.64s)]
*  And that's where she posted that she was going to be charging me. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=245.32s)]
*  The next day, my attorneys were able to locate the charges and kind of like, you know, get [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=248.24s)]
*  the ball rolling on that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=252.24s)]
*  But we found out via X. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=253.4s)]
*  So, Congresswoman, you let's talk more about those charges. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=255.8s)]
*  You've been charged with assaulting law enforcement officers while conducting that oversight that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  you just walked us through your response to those charges. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=265.8s)]
*  And do you think the word assaulting is doing a lot of heavy lifting here and how easy it [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  is for officials, the DOJ officials to use that particularly against you? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=277.16s)]
*  I mean, first of all, yes, I'm being charged with two counts of felony assault, according [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  to the U.S. Attorney's Office. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=291.72s)]
*  But I just honestly think it's political intimidation. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=294.48s)]
*  And as I always say, I'm just the next person on their list. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=297.32000000000005s)]
*  We have been seeing since January 20th a list of, you know, weaponizations from the Trump [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=301.12s)]
*  administration on different departments and especially the DOJ, rather its judges, you [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=307.12s)]
*  know, political leaders that they're investigating. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=312.52s)]
*  We constantly continue to see this behavior out of this administration. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=315.24s)]
*  And I think it's definitely an overreach. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=319.68s)]
*  And I'm looking forward to my day in court. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=321.44s)]
*  I mean, I can't wait to get there, me and my attorneys, where facts are on my side and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=323.76s)]
*  the facts are going to come out. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=328.88s)]
*  And I look forward to that day. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=330.12s)]
*  It's going to be bigger than any FOX headline, you know, that's out there that they continue [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=332.12s)]
*  to put out there. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=336.0s)]
*  And so really looking forward to court. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=337.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, you know, the immigration policies of this administration and the deportation [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  actions that they've taken have been something that you members of Congress are interested [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=345.92s)]
*  in, but also people around the country. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  We saw protests in Los Angeles and New York over the weekend. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=353.28s)]
*  In L.A., they will continue. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=357.67999999999995s)]
*  But you also have the president saying that they are sending in the National Guard. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=359.67999999999995s)]
*  They'll be there in the next 24 hours. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=363.2s)]
*  I'm curious your reaction to the administration sending National Guard troops to Los Angeles [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  to quell these protests that we're seeing. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, well, it's depressing to watch. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=374.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's a sad day for America to see this type of behavior, you know, coming out [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=377.0s)]
*  of the Trump administration that we've been constantly seeing. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  Administration has been extremely important to my residents and the people that I represent [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  in New Jersey, who is home to over two million immigrants, you know, in our state. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=389.24s)]
*  And so Trump's hateful immigration policies are at the doorsteps in the backyards of the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=394.44s)]
*  people that I represent. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=400.08s)]
*  We've seen them be extremely cruel. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=401.76s)]
*  Like this is why we have this situation, because they are extremely cruel. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=404.24s)]
*  Their policy is centered in cruelness. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=407.76s)]
*  We've seen them deport children with cancer. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=409.8s)]
*  We've seen them pick up students the last couple of days at school. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=412.52s)]
*  We've seen them pick up people who are there for their court dates. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=415.96s)]
*  We've seen them revoke student visas. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=418.4s)]
*  I mean, literally, we have a whole list of things that they have done so cruel around [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=420.56s)]
*  immigration and not just immigration on everything that they do. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=424.79999999999995s)]
*  They're snatching away health care from people. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l6VY-zqr78&t=427.84s)]
