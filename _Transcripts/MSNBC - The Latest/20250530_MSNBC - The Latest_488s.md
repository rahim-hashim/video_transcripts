# Ali Velshi: Donald Trump's trade rhetoric is not only outdated, it's divorced from reality
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw)
*  Tonight, Donald Trump took to social media at 8.09 a.m. to publicly lash out against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=0.0s)]
*  China after a rollercoaster few days for Trump's illegal tariffs that were first blocked, then [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=6.04s)]
*  they were confirmed blocked by a federal court, then they were temporarily reinstated. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=11.0s)]
*  Donald Trump accused China of violating a trade truce that he claims the two countries [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=15.72s)]
*  agreed to earlier this month. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=19.76s)]
*  He posted, quote, I made a fast deal with China in order to save them from what I thought [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=22.48s)]
*  was going to be a very bad situation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=26.72s)]
*  And I didn't want to see that happen because because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  and China got back to business as usual. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=33.12s)]
*  China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, this part's in all caps, has totally violated its [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=35.4s)]
*  agreement with us so much for being Mr. Nice Guy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=40.64s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't specify how China violated the agreement with the United States, but [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  it didn't stop him from repeating that allegation. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Are you aware of the tariffs on China? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=52.92s)]
*  You said that they violated the agreement with the U.S. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  Well, they did. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=59.68s)]
*  They were they violated a big part of the agreement we made. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=60.68s)]
*  You know, if you read that whole statement, I was very nice to them. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=64.68s)]
*  I helped them because they were in trouble with the stoppage of a massive amount of business. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=67.36s)]
*  But I'm sure that I'll speak to President Xi and hopefully we'll work that out. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=73.28s)]
*  But yeah, that's it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  There's a violation of the agreement. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  Never any specifics. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=81.28s)]
*  Today, Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration is planning to extend sanctions [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  on China's tech sector. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=86.56s)]
*  Donald Trump's antagonistic approach to trade with China has JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=89.08s)]
*  sounding the alarm. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=94.04s)]
*  At an economic forum this morning, he said this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=95.84s)]
*  We have problems and we got to deal with them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=100.08s)]
*  And then the biggest one underlying both that is the enemy within. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=103.48s)]
*  I'm not as worried about China. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=107.44s)]
*  China is a potential adversary. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=109.24s)]
*  They're doing a lot of things well. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=112.32s)]
*  They have a lot of problems. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=113.32s)]
*  What I really worry about is us. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=114.32s)]
*  Can we get our own act together, our own values, our own capability, our own management? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=117.08s)]
*  Now that's the important point here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=122.44s)]
*  It's not that there aren't things to deal with with China, but we seem to have more [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  things to deal with here at home. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=127.8s)]
*  According to the U.S. trade representative, Jameson Greer, Donald Trump's latest outburst [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=130.32s)]
*  from China's reluctance to lift restrictions on rare earth metals. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=135.28s)]
*  The Chinese are slow rolling their compliance, which is completely unacceptable and has to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  be addressed. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=144.84s)]
*  We haven't seen the flow of some of those critical minerals as they were supposed to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=145.84s)]
*  be doing. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=148.56s)]
*  Now, these rare earths, U.S. automakers, for instance, rely heavily on those metals, yet [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=149.56s)]
*  Donald Trump seems determined to continue to sell this fantasy that's actually disconnected [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=154.64s)]
*  from our manufacturing and economic reality. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=160.24s)]
*  All of the manufacturers will build their parts here, too. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=164.04s)]
*  I mean, it used to bother me. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=167.2s)]
*  They make a part in Canada, a part in Mexico, a part in Europe, and it's sent all over the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  place and nobody knew what the hell was happening. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  I think it's ridiculous. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  You build a car, make it in America. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  And I gave them a little leeway on that, you know, gave them some leeway. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=180.04s)]
*  But over the next year, they've got to have the whole thing built in America. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=184.6s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=187.72s)]
*  A part in Canada, a part in Mexico, a part in Europe. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=190.06s)]
*  And nobody knows what the hell is happening. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=192.92s)]
*  Car production and sales span continents. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=195.72s)]
*  The engine might be designed in Germany. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  The lithium battery components might come from Canada. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=200.17999999999998s)]
*  The parts might be assembled in Mexico. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=202.48s)]
*  And yes, they might all come together in Michigan or Ohio or Kentucky. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  Quote, they've got to have the whole thing built in America. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=208.44s)]
*  End quote. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  Does not reflect anything about either the automobile industry or, for that matter, the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  entire global economy in 2025. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=216.54s)]
*  It does not reflect the reality in this country either. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=219.16s)]
*  The factories to make all the parts to make a car don't exist in America. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=223.04s)]
*  It would take years to create them. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=228.4s)]
*  And in many cases, the materials those non-existent factories would need to make the parts that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=229.8s)]
*  also don't exist in America. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=234.56s)]
*  Donald Trump's trade rhetoric is not only outdated, it's divorced from reality. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=237.32s)]
*  And his reaction to it is tariffs, his reaction to everything to do with trade is tariffs. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=241.44s)]
*  Two federal courts have now said the tariffs are illegal and unconstitutional. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=246.28s)]
*  In fact, Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution speaks to this very issue. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=251.32s)]
*  It's crystal clear. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=257.48s)]
*  The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=259.04s)]
*  Now, that's some antiquated language, but it means tariffs. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=267.12s)]
*  The Congress levies tariffs, not the President, except for a few exceptions, where Congress, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=271.2s)]
*  very specifically, delegated tariff power to the President. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=275.48s)]
*  But if Congress doesn't give it to you, you don't have it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=279.12s)]
*  And again, according to federal courts, that does not include these Trump tariffs. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=282.04s)]
*  Even conservative outlets are making the argument that the Trump tariffs are illegal and unconstitutional. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=288.04s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial board says President Trump isn't a tariff king. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=294.04s)]
*  The National Review editorial board says the tariff power properly belongs with Congress. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=298.24s)]
*  Today, The Atlantic's Ilya Soman writes that Wednesday's ruling from the United States [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=302.72s)]
*  Court of International Trade against Donald Trump's tariffs was, quote, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=307.12s)]
*  a victory for separation of powers, end quote. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=310.64000000000004s)]
*  She continues, quote, The court ruled that Trump does not have the unbounded authority [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=313.96000000000004s)]
*  he claims to impose unlimited tariffs on goods from nearly every country. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=319.12s)]
*  The British overthrew King Charles I in part because he tried to impose ship money taxes [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=323.64000000000004s)]
*  without legislative authorization. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=329.12s)]
*  The President of the United States is no king, and he does not have the power to impose [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=331.12s)]
*  taxes in the form of tariffs wherever he feels like it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=336.36s)]
*  The court's decision upholds this fundamental principle of the Anglo-American constitutional [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=339.8s)]
*  tradition, end quote. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=344.16s)]
*  Yesterday, Donald Trump's National Economic Council chair called the ruling a, quote, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=346.4s)]
*  hiccup. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  In a month or two, you're going to look ahead and see that countries have opened their markets [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  to American products. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=355.92s)]
*  They've lowered their non-tariff barriers. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  And all the countries that have done that are being treated very respectfully and very [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=360.12s)]
*  well by the United States, end quote. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=364.8s)]
*  That's Kevin Hassan. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=367.8s)]
*  The Trump White House has also responded to these rulings against his tariffs by, yet [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=369.12s)]
*  again, attacking the judges who ruled against Donald Trump, which of course include a judge [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=372.76000000000005s)]
*  that Trump himself appointed. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  Adam Serwer wrote about this Trump legal strategy earlier this month for the Atlantic in an [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=381.24s)]
*  article entitled, Trump is tired of courts telling him that he's breaking the law, quote. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=385.36s)]
*  Chief Justice John Roberts warned in an appearance at Georgetown Law School that the rule of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=389.76s)]
*  law is endangered. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=394.16s)]
*  One reason for that is Roberts' own opinion that the President is nearly immune to criminal [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=396.8s)]
*  prosecution for law breaking, a finding that has emboldened Trump to ignore the law. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  Immunity is apparently insufficient, however. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=407.32s)]
*  Trump also wants the ability to violate the Constitution at will without meaningful resistance [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=409.44s)]
*  from the courts, end quote. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=415.12s)]
*  I'd only disagree with Adam Serwer in that he wants the ability to ignore the Constitution [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=416.44s)]
*  without any disagreement from the court. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=422.0s)]
*  In the Oval Office today, Donald Trump defended his tariffs, yet again. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=424.96s)]
*  Without the tariffs, our nation would be in peril. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=429.4s)]
*  We would really be in peril. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=431.96s)]
*  Again, lacking in detail. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=433.92s)]
*  What is he talking about? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=435.68s)]
*  The peril is a President who thinks he's the king and that the Constitution doesn't matter. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=437.34000000000003s)]
*  That's the peril, not the tariffs. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=441.8s)]
*  And no matter what he says, when Donald Trump launches a trade war, we pay for it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLi5ghnIGbw&t=443.96s)]
