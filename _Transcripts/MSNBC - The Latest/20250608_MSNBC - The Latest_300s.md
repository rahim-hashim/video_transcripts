# The new post-Roe reality: Emergency healthcare imperiled and miscarriage prosecuted
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o)
*  We may have just entered the most dangerous chapter of the post-Roe era to date. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=0.0s)]
*  With new but little-noticed developments over the past week, it's apparent that women are under greater threat of being criminalized for their pregnancies. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=4.0s)]
*  And the health and lives of pregnant women are more endangered than at any time since the Dobbs decision was handed down, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=11.0s)]
*  empowering anti-abortion regimes to enact draconian abortion bans across more than a dozen states. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=17.0s)]
*  We've seen the deadly impact of those abortion bans. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=23.0s)]
*  In Georgia, Amber Thurman died of sepsis after not receiving an abortion procedure known as dilation and curatage that could have saved her life. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=25.0s)]
*  Also in Georgia, Candy Miller died after she was too afraid to seek medical care because of the state's abortion ban. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=33.0s)]
*  In Texas, Josely Barnica, Portia Ngubezi, and Neveah Crane all died after being denied care following miscarriages. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=39.0s)]
*  And in the same state, Kylie Thurman lost part of her reproductive system after being turned away from a Texas hospital with an ectopic pregnancy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=47.0s)]
*  These are just some of the cases that we know about. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=55.0s)]
*  Quite simply, abortion is health care. Emergency abortion is emergency health care. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=57.0s)]
*  And without it, women die. We know this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=62.0s)]
*  But this week, the Trump administration revoked guidance issued by the Biden administration that directed hospitals, in the wake of Dobbs, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=66.0s)]
*  to provide emergency abortions even in states where abortion is banned because, again, emergency abortions are emergency health care to save a woman's life. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=73.0s)]
*  So why would the Trump administration want to come after emergency abortions specifically, the ones where if you don't get one, you could die? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=83.0s)]
*  Well, UC Davis law professor Mary Ziegler has a theory. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=91.0s)]
*  She notes that the new guidance from the Trump administration does not just revoke the Biden-era guidance on providing emergency abortions. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=94.0s)]
*  It also suggests that hospitals are required to protect the health of a pregnant woman's, quote, unborn child. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=101.0s)]
*  This, she suggests, hints at a broader anti-abortion strategy, writing, quote, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=107.0s)]
*  In the longer term, the end of the Biden-era guidance may be the tip of the sword further carving up abortion protections, even in states where that right is still protected, end quote. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=112.0s)]
*  So not only is it dangerous to experience a pregnancy complication in the wrong state, it's likely to get more complicated and dangerous even if you live in a safe state. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=122.0s)]
*  But that's not even the end of the alarming trends in anti-abortion zealotry. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=133.0s)]
*  We've been talking on the show for a while now about the rise in the criminalization of miscarriage since the fall of Roe. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=137.0s)]
*  Now, for those of us like me out there who didn't used to know a lot about this stuff, let me just remind you miscarriage is the most common pregnancy complication in America. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=144.0s)]
*  It's affecting, it affects up to one in five pregnancies, according to the National Institutes of Health. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=155.0s)]
*  And yet, since Dobbs was handed down, we've seen case after case of this common medical condition of miscarriage becoming a criminal investigation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=160.0s)]
*  Mallory Patrice Strait spent five months in police custody after miscarrying in a public bathroom in Texas. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=170.0s)]
*  The charges were dropped and an autopsy determined that she had naturally miscarried a non-viable fetus. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=176.0s)]
*  Brittany Watts was arrested on felony corpse abuse charges in Ohio for her miscarriage, which happened at home after she'd been to a hospital with severe bleeding and been told her pregnancy was not viable. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=182.0s)]
*  Her charges were also eventually dropped. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=193.0s)]
*  In Georgia, Selena Marie Chandler Scott had a miscarriage and was arrested for disposing of the fetal tissue. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=195.0s)]
*  Her charges were also dropped. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=201.0s)]
*  In South Carolina, Amari Marsh was accused of murder after losing her pregnancy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=203.0s)]
*  She was held in jail without bond for 22 days, ultimately released on house arrest, wearing an ankle monitor, and 13 months later she was cleared by a jury. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=208.0s)]
*  If you're not following these, I'm a grand jury, I'm sorry. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=218.0s)]
*  If you're not following these stories closely, it might be tempting to think of each as a one-off, a bad arrest, a wrong judgment call. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=221.0s)]
*  But this is a systematic criminalization of women's bodies. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=228.0s)]
*  And they're saying it out loud. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=233.0s)]
*  Listen to what a West Virginia prosecutor had to say about miscarriage. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=235.0s)]
*  Again, a common medical outcome for pregnant women. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=238.0s)]
*  Call your doctor, call law enforcement or 911 and just say, I miscarried and I didn't know. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=242.0s)]
*  Isn't there a difference between somebody that's eight months pregnant and somebody that's nine weeks pregnant? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=251.0s)]
*  You know, that's, those are going to be decisions that are going to have to be parsed out. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=260.0s)]
*  Parsed out by the law. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=266.0s)]
*  This is an overt call by law enforcement to turn a common medical outcome, one that only happens to pregnant women, into a matter for the police. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=271.0s)]
*  The idea that you're supposed to call 911 if you have a miscarriage at home so that your miscarriage can be investigated as a crime. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=281.0s)]
*  And hey, if you're only nine weeks long, it sounds like the cops will take that into consideration. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=287.0s)]
*  Maybe they'll go easy on you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=291.0s)]
*  This is America in 2025. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7bbQG5X4o&t=293.0s)]
