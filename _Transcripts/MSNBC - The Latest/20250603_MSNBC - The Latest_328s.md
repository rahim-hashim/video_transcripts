# 'Disgusting abomination': Musk slams Trump's 'outrageous pork-filled' megabill
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg)
*  So another crack between Elon Musk of Doge and Donald Trump, who just days ago, when he gave [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=0.0s)]
*  him his goodbye, said very nice things about him. But now, Elon Musk posted something on X, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=6.8s)]
*  extremely critical of the president's mega bill. And Caroline Levitt, the White House press [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=14.48s)]
*  secretary, was just asked about it at the White House press briefing. Take a listen. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  How mad do you think President Trump is going to be when he finds out that Elon Musk said, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=26.720000000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, port-filled [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=34.96s)]
*  You know you did wrong. You know it. Look, the president already knows where Elon Musk [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  stood on this bill. It doesn't change the president's opinion. This is one big, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=44.88s)]
*  beautiful bill, and he's sticking to it. Thank you. The national. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=48.56s)]
*  Let's bring back NBC's Von Hilliard. So it's either one big, beautiful bill or it's a disgusting [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=52.96s)]
*  abomination. Maybe Donald Trump doesn't care that Elon Musk says that. What do you make of this? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=58.8s)]
*  Right. Levitt dismissing Elon Musk's criticisms of it, but also she was asked specifically about [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=66.72s)]
*  the comments of Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, two longtime [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=73.36s)]
*  allies of the president, who have echoed the criticisms of Elon Musk saying that in its current [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=79.44s)]
*  form that they are hard nos and that there is no way that they will vote for this reconciliation [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  package under the circumstances that the Congressional Budget Office is estimating [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=90.88s)]
*  that it would add $3.8 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. And that is where some [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=96.4s)]
*  of the criticism, as Rand Paul has suggested, is that he wants a clean tax cut bill to be passed [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=103.12s)]
*  by this Congress. But what you see in this bill is $150 billion extra for border enforcement and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=109.2s)]
*  for mass deportation efforts, another $150 billion to go towards the military. And that's where some [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=119.36s)]
*  of these concerns about spending are going to make the passage of this bill very complicated, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=124.72s)]
*  because you have Josh Hawley on the other side who's been criticizing the cuts to Medicaid. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=132.8s)]
*  And of course you have Lisa Murkowski who has several different issues with it, and they can [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=137.52s)]
*  only afford, if every Democrat votes against it as is anticipated, they can only afford to lose [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=142.24s)]
*  three Republican senators. And right now it's people like Ron Johnson who, you've got to go [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=146.96s)]
*  back to 2020 and he was delivering alternative slate of electors. This is somebody who has been [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=151.44s)]
*  a close ally to the president who is suggesting that he could seek to try to kill this, because if [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=156.96s)]
*  I'm going to interrupt you for just a second, because Elon Musk has followed up, so I want to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  read this to you, Vaughn. He says it will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  two and a half trillion, exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation point, something [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=174.24s)]
*  Donald Trump likes, and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt. I mean, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  this is beyond what he said before. When you say things like a disgusting abomination, shame on [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=187.92s)]
*  those who voted for it, you know you did wrong, and a crushingly unsustainable debt. Is it possible [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=194.32s)]
*  it gives opening to some Republicans who felt uncomfortable to revisit what they might have [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  thought about, might have thought supporting it? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=211.2s)]
*  I think absolutely, and we were having a conversation a few minutes ago about the midterm [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  elections. There's still plenty of time for Republicans to go and try to primary other [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=216.96s)]
*  Republican members of the House or of the Senate, and Elon Musk put over $250 million towards the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  last election. Elon Musk changed the spending agreement back in December during the transition [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=229.52s)]
*  before Donald Trump was even in power simply by putting out a post on X and the deal came out [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=235.68s)]
*  putting out a post on X and the deal that was struck by John Thune and Speaker Johnson [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=241.52s)]
*  with Democrats in the House and Senate, it combusted because of this sort of messaging. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  So the question here is, should Donald Trump have done more to keep Elon Musk in Washington [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  because now he has a very powerful influence on social media, but also through the purse strings? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=260.08s)]
*  And if any changes are made to this reconciliation package by members of the Senate, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=266.0s)]
*  it'll have to go back to the House and be voted on again, Chris, and they passed the initial one [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=272.88s)]
*  by just 215 to 214 margin. Elon Musk is suddenly, you know, you could make the case potentially [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  helping Democrats in their messaging, making the case that Republicans are attempting to add [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=284.88s)]
*  spending at a time that they're also trying to run parallel tax cuts that simply add to the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=290.8s)]
*  deficit in the long run. It's not boring. I will just say that. Vaughn Hilliard, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=296.16s)]
*  still that July 4th deadline that they hope to get all this done by. We shall see. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDsSdyKFgg&t=302.72s)]
