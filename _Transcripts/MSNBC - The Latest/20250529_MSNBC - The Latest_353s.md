# ‘We are all still devastated and grieving’: Jewish community calls for unity after D.C. shooting
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc)
*  Just over an hour ago, the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., opened to the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=0.0s)]
*  public for the first time since last week's shooting that killed two Israeli embassy staffers. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=5.08s)]
*  This morning, the museum held a memorial ceremony for Yaron Lashinsky and Sarah Milgram, who [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=10.88s)]
*  were shot there last Wednesday and is now being investigated as a hate crime as well [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=16.56s)]
*  as an act of terror. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=21.38s)]
*  A senseless act of violence took from us two bright lights, two individuals dedicated to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=24.38s)]
*  the ideals this museum stands for. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=31.659999999999997s)]
*  Today, as we mourn, we also gather to reaffirm the unwavering commitment of the Capital Jewish [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=34.9s)]
*  Museum to its founding mission to preserve history, to foster understanding, and to build [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=42.099999999999994s)]
*  bridges with diverse communities that make up our community. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=50.02s)]
*  This commitment is now more important than ever. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=54.34s)]
*  The FBI says the suspect told an arresting officer that, quote, I did it for Palestine. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=58.34s)]
*  I did it for Gaza. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=63.5s)]
*  He is being held without bond and faces multiple charges, including first degree murder. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=65.58s)]
*  The executive director of the Capital Jewish Museum, Beatrice Gurwitz, joins me now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  You said today the attack cannot be the museum's last chapter. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=77.46s)]
*  I wonder what it means to reopen the museum today, but also the emotion that must have [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=81.58s)]
*  been surrounding everything. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=86.46s)]
*  So, absolutely. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=88.46s)]
*  I will start off by saying that we are all still devastated and all still grieving, and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=92.58s)]
*  our hearts are going out to Yaron and Sarah's family and friends and colleagues. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=98.06s)]
*  And we also know that we need to reopen the museum, welcome people in, and share the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=104.1s)]
*  stories of Jewish Washington. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=109.14s)]
*  This is a museum dedicated to exploring the rich and diverse and vibrant Jewish life here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=111.32s)]
*  And when we're confronted with anti-Semitism, it is more important than ever to share these [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=116.74s)]
*  stories with a broad public and use these stories as an opportunity to build community [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=121.46s)]
*  and foster dialogue. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  When you talk about building community, often, unfortunately, it does involve grief. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=127.96s)]
*  It involves mourning. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=133.66s)]
*  It involves anti-Semitism. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=134.78s)]
*  So this morning, honoring Yaron and Sarah, how important was that moment to bring the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=137.06s)]
*  community together, to remember, to have an opportunity for people to have conversations? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=143.1s)]
*  We were so pleased to bring people together, and it felt like we were bringing together [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=152.14s)]
*  all of these different parts of our overlapping community. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=155.74s)]
*  We had our closest neighbors, our next-door neighbors, our across-the-street neighbors. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=159.6s)]
*  We had our Jewish community. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  We had our museum community, and we had an interfaith community. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  And then we were so pleased to be joined by Mayor Muriel Bowser, who spoke with us this [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=169.32s)]
*  morning as well. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=174.6s)]
*  And having that opportunity to bring people together to mourn the lives and also to feel [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  their support as we continue forward in the work we are doing, the work we need to do, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=181.4s)]
*  that was enormously bolstering. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=186.72s)]
*  Amid the grief, there are practical considerations. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=190.08s)]
*  And just before the shooting, your museum was approved for a new security grant. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=193.12s)]
*  Do you feel confident of your ability to make changes that can allow staff and visitors [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=197.4s)]
*  to feel safe? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=202.44s)]
*  We are working very closely with law enforcement, with the mayor's office, and also with private [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=205.86s)]
*  security to enhance our security procedures at this juncture, as are so many other institutions [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=211.1s)]
*  around town after this incident. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=217.8s)]
*  And we will continue to be doing that and drawing our attention to it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=220.56s)]
*  And we really are looking forward to welcoming people back in the door and feeling the vibrancy [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=225.02s)]
*  in the space again. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=232.38s)]
*  And we are especially pleased to be doing so as we have a new special exhibition up [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=234.84s)]
*  that just opened two weeks ago about LGBT Jews in the federal city. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=238.54000000000002s)]
*  You just saw footage of the mayor touring that exhibition. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=242.62s)]
*  We have important stories to tell, and we really hope to welcome people in so that we [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=245.62s)]
*  can share those stories. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=249.38s)]
*  One of the speakers today, I was told, called the shooting a wake-up call. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=250.98000000000002s)]
*  I wonder if it is, and if so, is there a story, from what I've heard, you had two young people [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=255.3s)]
*  who believed very much in the mission of bringing people from very diverse backgrounds, diverse [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=266.70000000000005s)]
*  beliefs together. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=272.98s)]
*  And I wonder what the story is that might come out of this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=275.5s)]
*  As we've learned more about Zahra and Yaron over the past couple of weeks, we have learned [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=284.14000000000004s)]
*  that they were bridge builders, that they were diplomats, and that they were extremely [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=288.68s)]
*  dedicated to bringing different communities together. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=293.48s)]
*  We are also as a museum, and I think that they give us inspiration as we move forward. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=297.68s)]
*  We have committed ourselves to honoring their legacy by continuing to bring communities [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  together in our space and to explore together Jewish stories. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=308.04s)]
*  So I would say that they will stay with us, and we will do our best to honor their legacy [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=313.56s)]
*  going forward. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=320.6s)]
*  Beatrice Gerwitz, on what I know must have been a very emotional day. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  We wish you all the best moving forward, and thank you for taking the time to talk to us. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=326.76000000000005s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=332.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKeQrsbR8zc&t=351.6s)]
