# NYC Mayor Adams talks Trump's immigration crackdown, re-election campaign and more
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI)
*  Thirty-six past the hour, as the Dominican Republic continues to mourn the victims of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=0.0s)]
*  last week's deadly nightclub roof collapse, the first lawsuit has been filed against the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=4.36s)]
*  club's owners. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=9.52s)]
*  The suit was filed by the family of one of the 231 people who died in the collapse. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=10.52s)]
*  Other families have indicated they're also going to be filing lawsuits. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=17.88s)]
*  That lawsuit comes after New York City Mayor Eric Adams visited the site of the collapse [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=21.32s)]
*  in the capital of Santo Domingo. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=25.64s)]
*  Joining us now, New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=28.68s)]
*  Mayor, thank you so much for your time. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=30.76s)]
*  Good to be here, Jose. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=33.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=34.88s)]
*  I know you just got back from the Dominican Republic. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=35.88s)]
*  There are more than 230 people there who lost their lives in that nightclub collapse. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=37.96s)]
*  The entire country and so many others are in mourning. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=43.46s)]
*  You said you had to go there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=46.64s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=48.64s)]
*  Well, yesterday our city also held a day of mourning. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=49.64s)]
*  When you look at this city where close to a million Dominicans call it their home and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=53.959999999999994s)]
*  contribute to our city, and as I move throughout parts of the neighborhoods where you have [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=59.08s)]
*  a large Dominican population, I was extremely touched by how much this tragedy touched the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=64.6s)]
*  lives of so many. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=71.28s)]
*  I just thought being a mayor is not only substantive, bringing down crime, but it's also symbolism. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=72.56s)]
*  And I wanted to make a strong symbolic gesture of telling the Dominican people and Dominican [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=78.16s)]
*  Republic and here that this city mourns with them and stands with them. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=83.72s)]
*  What do you want to say to the Dominicanos that make New York City their home and who [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=88.28s)]
*  contribute so much for so long? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  On so many different levels. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=95.24s)]
*  The alignment of this administration in the Dominican community in particular, as well [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=98.0s)]
*  as the large immigrant population, we believe in family, we believe in faith, we believe [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=102.44s)]
*  in public safety, we believe in preparing the future for our children and small businesses. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=107.76s)]
*  That personifies the Dominican community. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=113.4s)]
*  I had Brother Rodriguez with me. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  He was from the Bodegas Association, United Bodegas Associations. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=119.28s)]
*  That's the heart and soul of working class people in the city. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=124.4s)]
*  And by having my delegation include all from my first deputy, Dominican deputy mayor, to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=128.12s)]
*  my deputy mayor, the first Dominican deputy mayor joined me, Deputy Mayor Amazar. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  It was a cross section of religious leaders and those who are New Yorkers who wanted to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=140.16s)]
*  come together. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=144.32s)]
*  And I'm saying to the Dominican people, you've had our back for so many years in this city. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=145.32s)]
*  The first immigrant that came here was a Dominican. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=151.26s)]
*  And I'm saying I have your back as your mayor. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=154.45999999999998s)]
*  And mayor, let's talk about the immigrant community and immigration. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=157.24s)]
*  Is New York City under your leadership today still a sanctuary city? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=160.96s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=165.24s)]
*  And I think that sometimes when people use that terminology, sanctuary city, they think [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=167.96s)]
*  that would law was passed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  No, it's not a law that's passed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=173.08s)]
*  And here's what it means to me as I articulated over and over again these last few months. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  It means that people who come here and pay tax dollars as they're here, they have a right [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=180.68s)]
*  to the services that are here and you don't have disorder. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  When we brought in and allowed 234,000 migrants and asylum seekers to come here, we wanted [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=189.44s)]
*  to make sure that children were in school, over 40,000, so they're not in dangerous [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  environments. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=201.04s)]
*  We want to make sure that people have access to healthcare and go to our hospitals. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=202.04s)]
*  And we want to make sure that people are not sleeping on our streets because that impacts [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=205.72s)]
*  the quality of life of our city. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  And so we're going to maintain the laws that are in place, but we're also going to ensure [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=211.28s)]
*  those who are participating in illegal and dangerous behavior after they're convicted [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=216.6s)]
*  and served their time, they should be deported from this city and from this country. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=222.28s)]
*  And just last week, your administration issued an executive order allowing federal immigration [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=226.96s)]
*  agents to reestablish an office at Rikers Island just over 10 years after the city banned [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=231.4s)]
*  ICE from that complex when New York City became a sanctuary city. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  Because yesterday, the city council sued you to block that order, claiming it is part [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=242.68s)]
*  of a corrupt quid pro quo bargain between you and the Trump administration. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=247.6s)]
*  That's what they claim. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=252.72s)]
*  Was that decision part of a corrupt quid pro quo? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=254.08s)]
*  I think it goes without saying, and I acknowledge in federal court when I raised my right hand [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=256.6s)]
*  that there was no quid pro quo. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=262.4s)]
*  That has become a sound bite for those who want to really distract us from the mission. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=264.2s)]
*  The mission is to keep our city safe. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=269.44s)]
*  And clearly, my first deputy mayor, Randy Mastro, he visited Rikers Island several times, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=271.76s)]
*  and it was up to him to make an independent decision based on his analysis and based on [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=277.79999999999995s)]
*  his understanding. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=282.56s)]
*  He was a former first deputy mayor. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=283.56s)]
*  He understands what it takes to keep cities safe. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=285.64s)]
*  He made that conclusion independently of my input. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=288.2s)]
*  I told him to do your own analysis and see what's the best way to move forward. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  Remember, when you look at the executive order, people are talking about ICE specifically, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=296.44s)]
*  but we're talking about other federal agencies that would be involved. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=301.56s)]
*  And that's very important. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=306.32s)]
*  When you allow gangs to run rampant on Rikers Island, it has a direct correlation on what [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=308.67999999999995s)]
*  plays out in the streets of the city of New York. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=313.84s)]
*  That's not acceptable. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=316.52s)]
*  Everyone that knows me know I have one belief that prerequisite to our prosperity is public [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  safety. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  The Senate of New Yorkers believe those who are convicted of dangerous crimes should be [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=323.36s)]
*  deported. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=328.44s)]
*  And I'm in alignment with working class people in the city. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=329.44s)]
*  And so, Mayor, just to be clear, you know, the buck stops with you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=332.04s)]
*  Are you stating that you agree or disagree? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  Is there any gray area between that executive decision, that executive order, and how you [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  feel? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=344.12s)]
*  Well, let's be clear. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=345.12s)]
*  The buck stops with me, but that's why you bring on board talented deputy mayors. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=346.64s)]
*  My deputy mayors are able to make their independent analysis and come to their own determination [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=351.8s)]
*  on a number of subject areas. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=356.98s)]
*  We're dealing with, when you talk about Rikers, we're dealing with the closure of Rikers. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=359.88s)]
*  That is something that I have Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro looking at as well to come up [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  with these decisions. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=371.32s)]
*  And so, I've always made it clear that we need to go after those who commit violent [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=372.32s)]
*  acts. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=377.2s)]
*  After they're deported, they should be, after they serve their time, they should be deported. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=379.2s)]
*  And I also make it clear on collaboration. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=384.32s)]
*  We should collaborate with the ICE, FBI, HSI on every level of enforcement. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  And you know, something that I think we really mix up in this conversation. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=393.24s)]
*  ICE is not a criminal organization. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  ICE is a law enforcement organization. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  I collaborate with law enforcement organizations for public safety. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  The law does not allow us to collaborate for civil deportation, and we won't do that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=405.92s)]
*  We will follow the law. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=411.16s)]
*  But I will never shy away from collaborating with my federal and state law enforcement [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=412.48s)]
*  agencies on all levels of bringing down crime and keeping New Yorkers safe. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=417.84000000000003s)]
*  Mayor, is that collaboration that you're speaking with, with federal officials, with ICE and [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  others, is it the same level of cooperation that you had with those same government entities [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=427.96000000000004s)]
*  during the Biden administration? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=434.68s)]
*  Yes, without a doubt. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  It has never changed. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=439.0s)]
*  And oftentimes people talk about the post-Trump election, President Trump election. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=440.0s)]
*  What I say to people all the time, go look at pre-election. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=447.64s)]
*  My message has been clear. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=451.52s)]
*  My words have not changed. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=452.68s)]
*  My actions have not changed. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  Collaborating with federal law enforcement is crucial. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=456.91999999999996s)]
*  I asked the president to come here, President Biden, when he was in office. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=459.64s)]
*  He came to New York City and sat down and visited how my collaboration was in place with something called HIDA. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=463.88s)]
*  Where we have city, state, and federal agencies that meet every morning. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=471.15999999999997s)]
*  He sat down with the police department. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=475.0s)]
*  I advocated to get an appointment to the ATF. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=476.64s)]
*  This is something that has always been in place. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=480.12s)]
*  And if anyone that knows me, that's the person they're going to tell you that Eric believed in collaboration with our state, federal, and city law enforcement. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=482.84s)]
*  This has not changed. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=490.2s)]
*  And I'm consistent on that message. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=491.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm going to go to the city and our city must be safe. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=493.24s)]
*  Mayor, what do you think of the Trump administration's decision to invoke the Alien Enemies Act and deport hundreds of migrants that are in this country to that high-security prison in El Salvador? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=496.24s)]
*  Well, I tried to share with people over and over again what many people failed to comprehend. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=506.24s)]
*  The federal government, by law, determines the immigration policies. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=512.24s)]
*  I don't. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=517.24s)]
*  That was a mistake that was made in the former administration. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=518.24s)]
*  When we had to handle almost 235,000 migrants and asylum seekers across the city, $7.5 billion, we should secure our borders. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=521.28s)]
*  We should make sure people come into the country, are not part of dangerous gangs and have a history of violence. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=532.28s)]
*  And federal government must fix our immigration status. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=538.8s)]
*  Cities should not handle that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=542.8s)]
*  And I was a bipartisan approach when I went to El Paso and saw what was happening there. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=544.4000000000001s)]
*  It should not happen to any city. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=552.4000000000001s)]
*  Federal government should handle the immigration policies and enforce those policies. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=554.4000000000001s)]
*  Mayor, all this comes as you're running for reelection, skipping the Democratic primary, running as an independent. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=560.4000000000001s)]
*  There's a history of independents winning New York City mayor races, Lindsay in 65, Bloomberg in 2009. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=565.4000000000001s)]
*  Why do you think this is the better route for you to take? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=572.48s)]
*  Well, it's clear that these bogus charges that were levied against me did not allow me the proper time to do all of the technical aspects of running in the Democratic primary. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=575.48s)]
*  We collected over 25,000 signatures to run in that primary. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=590.48s)]
*  I was looking forward to doing so. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=594.48s)]
*  But this case went on for so long. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=596.48s)]
*  It's overshadowed the success of this city. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  Those who do a proper unbiased analysis see we have more jobs in this city's history. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  Crime has decreased this last quarter. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  We saw the lowest number of shooters in the recorded history of this city safe on our subways. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=609.5600000000001s)]
*  Unemployment has dropped. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  We build more affordable housing. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=615.5600000000001s)]
*  All of those things that I should have been able to share with the public, it didn't give me the opportunity to do so [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=617.5600000000001s)]
*  and we are overshadowed by this really unfortunate, bogus case that was brought against me. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=624.64s)]
*  Now I have an opportunity to do so until November and share to New Yorkers how we turned the city around for working class people. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=629.64s)]
*  I'm looking forward to doing so in the process and this is a democratic process. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=637.64s)]
*  I'm still a Democrat, but I'm running on an independent line. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=641.64s)]
*  And Mayor, finally, the New York Post reports the Trump administration has referred New York City Attorney General Letitia James to the Justice Department over alleged mortgage fraud. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=645.64s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=654.64s)]
*  I think that the system would go through and go forward and it's up to the investigatory bodies to do unbiased investigation. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=655.64s)]
*  Letitia James, the AG, is a long-time friend and I wish her well. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=666.64s)]
*  Is this, do you think, any politicization of the Justice Department? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=672.64s)]
*  Well, I think that Letitia James, the Attorney General James, her spokesperson should speak on behalf of that. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=677.72s)]
*  I can only speak on my personal belief and my observation on what the former president, President Biden, said his Justice Department became to politicize. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=685.72s)]
*  The current president said it, I said it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=697.72s)]
*  So I just think that it's imperative that our criminal justice agencies do what's right [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=699.72s)]
*  and I think her spokesperson should respond to any allegations that were levied towards her. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=705.8000000000001s)]
*  New York City Mayor Eric Adams, I thank you very much for being with us today. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=711.8000000000001s)]
*  Very much appreciate your time. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=715.8000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=716.8000000000001s)]
*  Take care. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=717.8000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ssPA0aoiI&t=735.72s)]
