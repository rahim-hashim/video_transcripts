# BREAKING: Federal trade court blocks Trump's sweeping tariffs for exceeding his authority
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo)
*  But we're following some very big breaking news tonight, news that will come as a big [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=0.0s)]
*  blow to Donald Trump and his agenda. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  Tonight, a three-judge panel in New York has effectively balked almost all of Trump's disastrous [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=5.72s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Trump's tariffs against Mexico and Canada, his tariffs against the EU, against China, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  his tariffs against uninhabited islands with nothing but penguins and snow. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=16.88s)]
*  They are all blocked by this federal court decision. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=21.2s)]
*  It comes out of the United States Court of International Trade, which is a specialized [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=24.3s)]
*  You may or may not have ever heard of, but it deals specifically with trade issues. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=28.88s)]
*  A three-judge panel consisting of one Reagan appointee, one Obama appointee, and crucially [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=33.12s)]
*  and importantly, one Trump appointee, ruled unanimously that Trump's trade war is essentially [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=38.92s)]
*  illegal, that he does not have the authority to enact these sweeping tariffs on his own. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=44.72s)]
*  When Trump signed the executive order enacting these tariffs, he cited something called [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=50.64s)]
*  the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that gives the president the authority [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=53.92s)]
*  to use tariffs in times of national emergency. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=59.32s)]
*  And in their ruling tonight, the judges write, quote, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=62.44s)]
*  The law does not grant tariff authority to the president simply when he finds or determines [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=84.48s)]
*  that an unusual and extraordinary threat exists. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=89.84s)]
*  I sense a little snark there. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=92.84s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=94.44s)]
*  But man, when you put it that way, it all kind of makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=95.52s)]
*  I mean, I'm not an expert in international trade law. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=99.84s)]
*  But Trump's justifications for these tariffs have always been pretty thin, as Chris and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=102.64s)]
*  I were just talking about. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=106.88s)]
*  Trump claimed his tariffs on Canada were to stop fentanyl trafficking, even though less [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=107.92s)]
*  than one percent of the fentanyl we see at the border comes from Canada, less than one [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=112.4s)]
*  percent. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  Now, for the first time, we have a federal court saying that we all, well, we all kind [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  of sort of knew to be true already. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=121.0s)]
*  The president's justification for this trade war is BS. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  And that is not all. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  The court tonight also ordered that all of the tariffs Trump has collected so far be [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=128.52s)]
*  vacated. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=132.72s)]
*  Just how that will work, especially from a White House that doesn't exactly abide by [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=134.08s)]
*  every court order. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=138.16s)]
*  And what that will all mean, I do not know. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=139.60000000000002s)]
*  This is just breaking this news in the last couple of hours. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=141.88000000000002s)]
*  But I have the right person to ask. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=144.8s)]
*  Starting off tonight is Arizona Attorney General Chris Mays, who co-led this lawsuit against [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=147.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's tariffs. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=151.56s)]
*  Attorney General Mays, thank you for joining us on such short notice. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=153.12s)]
*  This all just happened in the last couple of hours, as you well know. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  Let me just start, because I think we're all trying to digest this, and people at home [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=159.96s)]
*  are wondering what this exactly means. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=162.52s)]
*  It's our understanding that this ruling applies to all tariffs except for the ones imposed [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=165.16s)]
*  on steel and aluminum. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=170.24s)]
*  First, is that right? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  And can you just give us the scope of the impact of this ruling tonight? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=176.68s)]
*  Thanks, Jenna. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=177.68s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=178.68s)]
*  It's a huge day for American consumers, for small businesses all throughout this country [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  who were on the precipice of being absolutely devastated and harmed by these tariffs. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=187.12s)]
*  So we are celebrating this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=195.44s)]
*  We, like you, are still digesting it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  But essentially, you're right. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=200.68s)]
*  The Court of International Trade, in a very thoughtful decision, said that essentially [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=203.0s)]
*  all of the tariffs that Donald Trump engaged in under IEPA, basically the April tariffs, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=210.16000000000003s)]
*  are unlawful. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  So they are enjoined. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=223.2s)]
*  They are essentially enjoined as of tonight, as you and I are speaking. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=224.8s)]
*  It looks like the Trump administration has made it clear they're going to try to appeal [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=229.64s)]
*  this decision, and they'll probably seek a stay. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=233.36s)]
*  But for now, this is good news for the people of America. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=236.8s)]
*  No question about it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=241.0s)]
*  There's been understandable panic, concern about costs in so many areas of goods that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=242.48s)]
*  people rely on. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=247.76s)]
*  I want to get to the legal next steps in a moment, but I just want to ask, I mean, the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=249.16s)]
*  jury judge panel also ordered that any tariff payments already collected be vacated, which [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  sounds like it means be paid back. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=257.52s)]
*  Does that what it means? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  And how exactly would that work? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think we're still sorting through that, so I don't want to be too declarative [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=263.08s)]
*  about that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=267.96s)]
*  But yes, essentially, it vacates the tariffs, and it enjoins them from going forward. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=268.96s)]
*  So that's why we're expecting Trump to try to appeal this decision. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  And they'll probably end up at the United States Supreme Court at some point in the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=282.48s)]
*  very near future. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=287.12s)]
*  So just just in the last minutes, right before we came on air, the Trump administration did [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=289.36s)]
*  file a notice of appeal, which I'm sure doesn't surprise you, as you were just saying. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=295.08s)]
*  It also has seemed it's always seemed weird that Donald Trump just had the unilateral [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=300.28s)]
*  power to wake up and decide to put tariffs on every country in the world for whatever [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=304.76s)]
*  reason he decided. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=307.98s)]
*  I mean, as a layperson, but even with this appeal being filed and with some of their [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=309.1s)]
*  aggressive responses, he's also somebody who doesn't really have a history of complying [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=313.54s)]
*  always with court rulings. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=318.18s)]
*  So what happens if he doesn't? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=319.58000000000004s)]
*  I know we're just digesting this, but have you thought about that with the others who [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=321.66s)]
*  filed this lawsuit? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=325.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's a fair it's a fair point. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=327.02000000000004s)]
*  And you know, as you know, the Democratic AGs have sued Donald Trump now, I think more [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=331.14000000000004s)]
*  than 20 times on a couple of occasions. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=337.14s)]
*  You're right. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=339.9s)]
*  He has violated federal court orders. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=341.18s)]
*  And what we have done is we have gone back into the federal court when that happens and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=344.46s)]
*  we have asked for what's called a motion to compel. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=350.94s)]
*  So I suppose if they try to continue to collect these tariffs and they try to continue the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=354.14s)]
*  tariffs schemes, despite the Court of International Trade's opinion, we would have to go back [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=361.53999999999996s)]
*  in for a motion to compel. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=367.65999999999997s)]
*  Let's hope that's not necessary. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=369.21999999999997s)]
*  And let's see what happens next. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  We will see. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=373.9s)]
*  We'll have to keep talking about it with you and your other Democratic AGs. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=374.9s)]
*  In a statement, they had they've had a pretty aggressive response to this is one way to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=378.14s)]
*  define it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=383.14s)]
*  But I think it's so important to untangle all of this. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=384.26s)]
*  And you're the perfect expert to do that with. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=386.46s)]
*  In a statement after the ruling, the White House said America's trade deficits constitute [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=388.5s)]
*  a national emergency and that's up to the president to decide, not judges. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=392.14s)]
*  I mean, essentially, the courts seem to say the opposite. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=396.7s)]
*  But what do you say to that? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=399.53999999999996s)]
*  No, that's right. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=401.34s)]
*  And so there's a couple of things here. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=403.5s)]
*  Number one, fundamentally, the power to levy tariffs rests with Congress, right? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=405.29999999999995s)]
*  And as you know, nowhere in IEPA does it even mention the word tariffs. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=412.62s)]
*  Now, the court in its decision didn't say that the president, whoever the president [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=417.66s)]
*  is, never can levy tariffs under IEPA. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=424.54s)]
*  But what the court is saying is the president does not have unbounded authority to levy [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=428.18s)]
*  these tariffs. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=433.98s)]
*  And that's what this was. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=435.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, he just sort of woke up one day and decided that he was going to levy tariffs [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  on Canada and China and Mexico and the worldwide tariffs and declared that this was all based [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=441.3s)]
*  on fentanyl. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=449.18s)]
*  Well, OK. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=450.18s)]
*  But then he then came up with different reasons for it, as you just pointed out. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=452.86s)]
*  So what are the reasons for it? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=456.90000000000003s)]
*  And if you're going to put tariffs on tomatoes, what does that have to do with fentanyl? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=459.94s)]
*  It's a good question, tomatoes and fentanyl. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=466.58000000000004s)]
*  The other way they seem to have responded. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=469.7s)]
*  Trump adviser Stephen Miller tweeted the judicial coup is out of control, which seems to be [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=472.65999999999997s)]
*  kind of a predictable knee-jerk reaction to any time a court rules against them. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=478.42s)]
*  Now, this panel, as I started off the show saying, was unanimous. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=483.65999999999997s)]
*  One of the appointees on the panel was a Trump appointee. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=487.36s)]
*  But what do you say to that sort of response from the White House? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=491.21999999999997s)]
*  You know, it's just that it's so disappointing, Jen, and it just points to a trend that we [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=495.46s)]
*  are seeing of this administration going after judges, undermining the authority of the judicial [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=502.9s)]
*  branch of government, not respecting the two other branches of government. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=510.3s)]
*  I mean, again, that's what this case is about. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=515.42s)]
*  This case is about the president's power vis-a-vis Congress. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=518.34s)]
*  Now he's disrespecting judges. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=523.0600000000001s)]
*  And he basically makes these sort of very disrespectful and alarming statements every [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=525.5400000000001s)]
*  time he loses a case. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=532.1400000000001s)]
*  And that's just not how things are done in our country. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=533.82s)]
*  We've already discussed some of this. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=537.86s)]
*  They've already filed their notice of appeal. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=539.62s)]
*  You said it could go to the Supreme Court. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=541.46s)]
*  What's next? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=543.86s)]
*  I mean, what should we be watching for in the next days and weeks here? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=544.86s)]
*  So I think you've kind of laid out some of them, which is, you know, what does, you know, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=549.42s)]
*  do they seek a stay of this court's decision? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=554.54s)]
*  We'll watch for that. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=557.9399999999999s)]
*  They can certainly, they have the ability to do that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=559.38s)]
*  If this court does not allow for a stay, then we'll have to watch to make sure that the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=564.26s)]
*  Trump administration does not, as you pointed out, violate its order. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=569.18s)]
*  And then I would be watching for, you know, how businesses react to this. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=576.14s)]
*  I think that a lot of small businesses, midsize businesses, large businesses are all going [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=582.5400000000001s)]
*  to support this and be absolutely thrilled with it and hope that it sticks because these [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=588.3000000000001s)]
*  tariffs are causing chaos for our consumers. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=595.58s)]
*  This is a tax. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=599.1800000000001s)]
*  This is a direct tax, Jen, on the people of America. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=600.48s)]
*  I think that's why this is such a huge victory and a huge night for our country, because [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=605.62s)]
*  hopefully it's the start of us getting things back on track and preventing this harm. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=610.8599999999999s)]
*  No question about that. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=616.8599999999999s)]
*  Arizona Attorney General Chris Mays, thank you so much for joining me on such short notice [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=618.02s)]
*  and providing so much helpful information to people watching out there. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=621.8199999999999s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=625.2199999999999s)]
*  Thanks, Jen. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnKZt_oIJo&t=626.8599999999999s)]
