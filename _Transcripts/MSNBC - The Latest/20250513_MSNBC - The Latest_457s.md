# ’Against the constitution!’: Norm Eisen blasts Trump for accepting luxury jet from Qatar
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c)
*  With some breaking news now, new pushback from Democrats against President Trump's plan to accept that $400 million luxury jet from Qatar as the new Air Force One. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says he plans to hold or put a hold on all Trump Department justice nominees while he waits for more answers from the DOJ about why they're signing off on this gift. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Here was the president defending the decision yesterday. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=23.8s)]
*  Mr. President, what do you say to people who view that luxury jet as a personal gift to you? Why not leave it behind? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=26.6s)]
*  You should be embarrassed asking that question. They're giving us a free jet. I could say, no, no, no, don't give us. I want to pay you a billion or 400 million or whatever it is. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=34.4s)]
*  Or I could say thank you very much. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=44.6s)]
*  Joining us now, Norm Eisen, who worked as the top White House ethics lawyer under President Obama. He is now the executive chair of the State Democracy Defenders Fund. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=48.2s)]
*  Norm, good to have you here. The DOJ signed off on this deal. They reportedly justified it by saying there, you know, this was a gift to the government, not the president, according to ABC. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=57.2s)]
*  Does that pass the smell test? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=68.2s)]
*  It doesn't, Anna, because if you look at all of the indicators, it's at least in part a personal gift to the president. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=71.2s)]
*  He expressed a desire for a new Air Force One. He toured this Qatari plane when it was on the tarmac in Palm Beach. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=81.2s)]
*  He's going to have the personal use of it while he's in office, and it's leaving when he leaves the office is following him to his presidential library. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=91.2s)]
*  When you put all that together and, Anna, when you listen to his words, I could have said no. I make the decision to accept this in the clip we just played. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=104.2s)]
*  I, I, I clearly he's talking about a gift, at least in part to himself. That's against the Constitution. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=116.2s)]
*  We are seeing bipartisan pushback, at least in part, even some of the president's closest allies seem uncomfortable with this plan. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=124.2s)]
*  Laura Loomer writing on social media, for example, that accepting the plane would be a stain on the administration. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=131.2s)]
*  And here's some of the reaction from Republican lawmakers. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=137.2s)]
*  I think it's a mistake and it's just bringing up something he doesn't need. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=142.2s)]
*  Well, France gave us the Statue of Liberty, didn't it? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=145.2s)]
*  Is that the same thing? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=148.2s)]
*  But they gave us the Statue of Liberty. Was that legal? I don't know what the law is. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=150.2s)]
*  He seems to intend to use it for Air Force One. You have security concerns? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=155.2s)]
*  Well, they better sweep that plane from front to back. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=159.2s)]
*  Some mixed reaction there from Republicans, but doesn't sound like they're ready to take action. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=166.2s)]
*  Well, on a. Senator Kenny says France gave us the Statue of Liberty. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=172.2s)]
*  Well, if Donald Trump were taking the Statue of Liberty with him when he left the presidency, yes, that would be an emolument. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=178.2s)]
*  I mean, they're bending over backwards. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=186.2s)]
*  I think the criticism is justified. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=189.2s)]
*  It's not just that the Constitution says no gifts from foreign countries to a president. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=191.2s)]
*  The security concerns. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=197.2s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=199.2s)]
*  Qatar is one of the hosts for Hamas. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=201.2s)]
*  We're now going to take a plane from them. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=207.2s)]
*  The thing is so absurd. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=211.2s)]
*  This is autocracy run amok. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=213.2s)]
*  Courts have said 125 times that Donald Trump has violated the Constitution or laws. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=215.2s)]
*  Make it 126. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=221.2s)]
*  And this plane isn't even the worst of it on. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=223.2s)]
*  He's also taking crypto cash from the UAE in one of his businesses. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=226.2s)]
*  Two billion dollars. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=232.2s)]
*  He's going to visit that country, too, as well as Qatar on this trip. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=234.2s)]
*  America is not for sale, but he seems to be putting it on the auction block. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=237.2s)]
*  I mean, you brought up the security concerns. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=243.2s)]
*  Could there be a way to challenge this move on that basis? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=245.2s)]
*  I sued to oppose Donald Trump taking foreign government cash and benefits in the first Trump administration and multiple courts sided with us in that dispute before Donald Trump left office. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=250.2s)]
*  The Supreme Court said, well, he's no longer president. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=266.2s)]
*  The cases can't proceed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=271.2s)]
*  I think that it should be challenged in the legislature. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=273.2s)]
*  Congress is now considering legislation relating to Trump's crypto conflicts. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=276.2s)]
*  The money is taking his crypto businesses. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=281.2s)]
*  They should also say in that bill for security reasons, no Qatari planes, no Amalumans Force One. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=283.2s)]
*  Yes, it should be blocked by Congress and perhaps by the courts. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=293.2s)]
*  I want to I want to ask you more about the other issue brought up, which is the crypto piece of the ethics questions involving this administration. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=297.2s)]
*  Trump has this mean crypto coin. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=308.2s)]
*  Now top buyers could win dinner with the president or a White House tour. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=310.2s)]
*  The New York Times points out that the Trump administration also recently disbanded a DOJ unit dedicated to investigating cryptocurrency crimes. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=314.2s)]
*  Have you ever seen anything like this? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=322.2s)]
*  And beyond the potential personal financial benefit, is there risk involved for the U.S.? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=324.2s)]
*  But first of all, how can the American people trust Donald Trump to regulate the crypto industry when he himself has huge financial stakes in that industry? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=330.2s)]
*  So that's a conflict of interest. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=346.2s)]
*  There's a reason we have these rules. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=348.2s)]
*  We're concerned that a president will sacrifice the interests of the American people to his own personal interests. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=350.2s)]
*  The people lose money as he lowers regulatory barriers for cryptos to protect consumers. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=358.2s)]
*  Secondly, there's the foreign cash element that comes in to all of this and the even worse conflicts when you have foreign governments involved. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=365.2s)]
*  And then you have the president selling a personal dinner at one of his golf clubs to the largest holders of his Trump meme coin and the very largest get a White House tour. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=374.2s)]
*  The White House is for sale. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=389.2s)]
*  No, this is conflicts and ethics violations running amok. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=391.2s)]
*  Anna, when I was the ethics czar in the Obama administration, I wouldn't even let Barack Obama refinance his modest family home in Chicago because we were in the middle of the Great Recession. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=396.2s)]
*  He was regulating the banks. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=407.2s)]
*  This is too much. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=409.2s)]
*  And that's why you're seeing an explosion of criticism from both sides of the aisle. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=410.2s)]
*  And the crypto bill that was considered last week was blocked. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=415.2s)]
*  Senators of both parties because of these concerns. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=419.2s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=422.2s)]
*  That was one of those rare moments where Republicans in Congress didn't go along with presidents ideas and agenda. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=423.2s)]
*  Norm Eisen, thank you for your expertise for joining us. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=432.2s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=435.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scuks6lz20c&t=453.2s)]
