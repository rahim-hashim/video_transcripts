# Trump's new DOJ Civil Rights Division leader has worked to limit Americans’ voting rights
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY)
*  The Trump administration continues to make drastic changes at the Justice Department, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=0.0s)]
*  including reassigning more than a dozen senior career lawyers in the Civil Rights Division. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Division is now charged with pursuing priorities laid out in a series of Trump executive orders, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=11.28s)]
*  including keeping men out of women's sports and ending radical indoctrination in K-12 [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=16.96s)]
*  schooling. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  That is according to memos obtained by NBC News. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  The Trump administration got a setback on that second so-called priority today. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=27.56s)]
*  Federal Judge in New Hampshire blocked directives from the Department of Education, threatening [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=31.72s)]
*  to cut federal funding for public schools with diversity, equity and inclusion programs, DEI. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=36.32s)]
*  Andrew Weissman is back with Merritt. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=41.44s)]
*  Let's just level set here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=43.16s)]
*  Traditionally, what has the Civil Rights Division been focused on? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  So they look in general at the federal level with sort of systemic racism issues. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=48.76s)]
*  They look at police departments that may have a history and where there's a wide prevalence [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=55.64s)]
*  of racism or policies that have enormous disparate impact on race and national origin or religion. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=61.96s)]
*  And they take action after lots of due process. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=74.72s)]
*  These changes were implemented by the new division head, Harmeet Dhillon, who Democracy [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=79.86s)]
*  Dock describes as since the founding of her namesake law firm in 2006, Dhillon has become [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=86.14s)]
*  one of the leading legal figures working instead to roll back voting rights across the country. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=91.3s)]
*  And the reason I point that out is because they knew what they were doing, right? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=96.06s)]
*  This is now part of a long-term plan. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=99.14s)]
*  They installed her there specifically so she could run this culture wars playbook. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=101.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=106.66s)]
*  And this is not something that's surprising. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=107.66s)]
*  This is Project 2025 signaled all of this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=109.2s)]
*  And this is something that we've seen. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=113.4s)]
*  It is interesting that you have really the dismantling of such key parts of the Civil [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=115.2s)]
*  Rights Division at the same time that going to the hypocrisy point that we were just talking [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=123.38s)]
*  about that you have the administration using anti-Semitism as the purported reason for [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=129.32s)]
*  going after Columbia and Harvard and other academic institutions when you don't see [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=138.06s)]
*  that sort of in the Civil Rights Division as part of the playbook. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=143.78s)]
*  And so again, that's the kind of thing you look to and say, is this a ruse? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=148.08s)]
*  Because you don't see a sort of consistent pattern on the part of the administration [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=153.02s)]
*  saying we want to take this seriously. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  There's the abandoning of what the Civil Rights Division has traditionally done. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=159.72s)]
*  There is the new playbook that they're running. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=162.98000000000002s)]
*  I am also intrigued by how it is that they're doing it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=164.44s)]
*  It was well articulated by a former senior official in the division who told NBC News, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=167.78s)]
*  this is a 180 shift from the division's traditional mission. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=172.78s)]
*  The official added, and this is the part I thought was interesting, these documents appear [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=175.9s)]
*  to have been created in a vacuum, completely divorced from reality. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=179.24s)]
*  The division can only enforce statutes that have been passed by Congress. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=183.10000000000002s)]
*  And these orders seem to contemplate division attorneys executing on work that fundamentally [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=188.06s)]
*  departs from the division's longstanding mission. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=193.02s)]
*  We're watching this administration sort of run around, do a run around, around congressional [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=195.78s)]
*  authority. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=200.78s)]
*  And this seems like yet another example. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=201.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great point. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=203.26000000000002s)]
*  So in terms of the enforcement, one, in terms of how the administration is going to enforce [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=205.5s)]
*  the laws that Congress set down, their elections matter and elections have consequences. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=214.4s)]
*  And that's one where our audience may agree or disagree, I suspect disagree with a lot [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=220.78s)]
*  of it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=226.26s)]
*  But that's not illegal. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=227.26s)]
*  That's something you can make a judgment that that's not something I do not support. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=228.9s)]
*  I think that that's the wrong policy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=233.54s)]
*  You're raising a sort of more fundamental problem, which is that the president has to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=236.3s)]
*  stay within the bounds of what Congress has set, assuming it has been found to be constitutional. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=241.62s)]
*  He can't set new and different rules. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=249.1s)]
*  And so that's one of the reasons that these efforts to so-called eradicate DEI. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=252.38s)]
*  I think just today you have two separate judges issuing temporary restraining orders saying [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=256.86s)]
*  that what the administration is trying to do is something that may in fact violate the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=263.74s)]
*  law. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=270.02s)]
*  It doesn't provide due process. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=271.02s)]
*  And there's nothing about the terms. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=272.38s)]
*  I'm going to sort of channel Judge Beryl Howell, which said there's nothing dirty or evil about [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=274.5s)]
*  the words diversity, equity, inclusion. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=281.14s)]
*  She challenged the government lawyer to say, what exactly is the problem with the diversity? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=283.4s)]
*  You're for diversity when it comes to veterans. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=290.82s)]
*  Is that improper diversity, equity and inclusion? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=294.88s)]
*  Is that something that you're against? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=298.3s)]
*  They want to diversify the Fulbright Scholarship so that we want to have more babies because [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=300.78000000000003s)]
*  they get an extra dispensation if they are married and have kids. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=304.7s)]
*  You said to me when you and I were talking between the break about the first story, which [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=311.18s)]
*  is Act Blue, that they just sort of keep moving the markers and such that it can sort of culturally [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  become like, well, nothing seems that extreme. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=321.58s)]
*  Nothing seems that out of step. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=325.76s)]
*  And this seems like yet another example of that, right? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=329.22s)]
*  Which is like, yeah, well, they're in charge now. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=334.86s)]
*  And this is what they were elected to do. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=338.3s)]
*  Who cares about the fact that they are just absolutely trampling on civil rights, not [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=340.74s)]
*  protecting them? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=345.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=347.38000000000005s)]
*  So let me maybe give you an example from today's opinion that is... [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=348.38000000000005s)]
*  Which one? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=353.98s)]
*  This is Dabney Friedrich in joining one of the DEI efforts by the president. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=355.9s)]
*  And this is a judge who was appointed by Donald Trump in his first term. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=364.09999999999997s)]
*  And when she is talking about it, she is saying... [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=370.97999999999996s)]
*  And she's trying to say, what is so wrong with this? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=374.02s)]
*  And is this... [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=376.5s)]
*  Have you set a clear marker or are you really trying to... [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=377.5s)]
*  And this is me, not her saying, are you really just trying to say that there's no [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=381.73999999999995s)]
*  such thing as racism and a systemic racism? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=385.82s)]
*  And she said, would it be improper for there to be courses taught by professors who promote [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=388.46s)]
*  the view that systemic racism exists and that race can be central to one's experiences and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=393.34s)]
*  identity? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=399.26s)]
*  Would that be unlawful? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=400.26s)]
*  Does a school's black pre-law student union open to all students, nonetheless treat black [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=402.02s)]
*  students differently on the basis of race? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=407.1s)]
*  What she's saying is trying to force the government to say, I want to know exactly what your position [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=410.1s)]
*  is and don't be gray or ambiguous about it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=415.26000000000005s)]
*  And then the reason is that she's entitled to then look at that and say, I'm looking [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=419.14000000000004s)]
*  at what Congress has said and I'm looking at what the Supreme Court has said about the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=423.86s)]
*  Constitution, and I will measure what you specifically want to do against those, not [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=427.98s)]
*  against your unilateral view as to what you think is appropriate. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=433.3s)]
*  Because yes, the president has lots of power. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=438.46000000000004s)]
*  Yes, the executive has lots of power, but they have to stay within those rules. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GSFSZAHYY&t=440.22s)]
