# Trump's second term already falling apart less than 100 days in, polls show
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY)
*  Very provocative headline there. Are things falling apart for Trump? I don't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=0.0s)]
*  know, but let's look. Let's look at the evidence from the Post tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=6.48s)]
*  Multiple polls this week showed Trump hitting new lows. His approval rating [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  has been double digits underwater in surveys from the Pew Research Center, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=15.88s)]
*  where he's minus 19, the Economist YouGov poll, where he's minus 13, the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=20.28s)]
*  Reuters Ipsos poll, where he's minus 11, and now Fox News, where he is also [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  Trump was already more unpopular at this point in his presidency than any modern [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=29.16s)]
*  president not named Donald Trump. He's now flirting with falling below where he [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=34.28s)]
*  was even at this point in his historically unpopular first term. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=38.58s)]
*  Quote, perhaps more troubling for Trump, most of his major policies are even more [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  unpopular than he is. That suggests his image is largely buoyed by loyalists who [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=50.04s)]
*  might not like what they are seeing from him, but they still say they support him [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=55.76s)]
*  for now. Quote, around six in ten Americans have been critical of both his [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  tariffs and Elon Musk's rough-shot efforts to cut government programs and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=64.88s)]
*  employees. In one poll this week, Americans said by a nearly two to one [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=69.88s)]
*  proportion that the Trump administration should abide by a court order to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=74.36s)]
*  facilitate the return of a man wrongly deported to prison in El Salvador, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=78.52s)]
*  Kilmar Abrego Garcia. That's a court order the administration is apparently [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=82.24s)]
*  flouting. Polling also suggests Americans strongly reject the Trump [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=87.52s)]
*  administration sending hundreds of men to the brutal El Salvador prison without [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=91.52s)]
*  due process, as well as Trump's efforts to deport student visa holders. Quote, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=96.91999999999999s)]
*  in some, in some, it's all an increasing mess. Trump might try to muddle through, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=102.52s)]
*  including by pressing forward on tariffs and risking a constitutional crisis by [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=110.48s)]
*  challenging the courts to actually make him abide by their orders. Quote, but with [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  the courts asserting themselves and the public taking an increasingly dim view [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=119.0s)]
*  of what he is doing, political gravity is taking a heavy toll. It took a little [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=124.12s)]
*  less than 100 days. Yeah, well, when you put it like that way, it does sound bad. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=130.16s)]
*  It does sound like things are falling apart for Trump. But you know, we've also [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=137.0s)]
*  got the receipts, like we've got the actual numbers. So you don't just have to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=143.64s)]
*  trust the characterization of them in the Washington Post tonight. We can [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=147.24s)]
*  actually just look. Let's start with the Fox News poll. Why not? Do you think the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=151.76s)]
*  Trump administration has been competent and effective in managing the federal [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=155.76s)]
*  government? No, by a nine point margin. Do you approve of the job Donald Trump is [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=159.48s)]
*  doing as president? No, by an 11 point margin. In the long run, do you think [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=164.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's policies will help the country? No, by an 11 point margin. So, you [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  know, not positive on the big picture for President Trump. Well, what about the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  other president? Do you approve of the job Elon Musk is doing working with Doge, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=181.83999999999997s)]
*  the Department of Government Efficiency? Fox News poll respondents say no, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  resoundingly by a 17 point margin. Do you approve of the way Donald Trump is [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=193.48s)]
*  handling the economy? No, by an 18 point margin. 18 points in the economy. Do you [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=198.64s)]
*  think Donald Trump's policies are helping the US economy? No, by a 22 point margin. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  Do you think imposing tariffs on products imported from other countries helps the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=208.92s)]
*  US economy? No, by a 23 point margin. Do you approve of the way Trump is handling [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  tariffs? No, 25 point margin. Do you approve of the way Trump is handling [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  inflation? No, 26 point margin. Oh, and here's a really good one. This is again, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=221.52s)]
*  the Fox News poll. If President Trump thinks the Supreme Court is overstepping [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=226.2s)]
*  its constitutional authority, can he ignore the court? No, by a 49 point margin. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=231.44s)]
*  So that's the Fox News poll. Obviously, that's all terrible news for Trump. The [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=241.52s)]
*  others are worse. Here's the Economist YouGov poll. They pulled on a bunch of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  policy issues, asking people not just how they feel about how Trump is handling [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  himself generally, but how he's doing on basically every issue area of policy. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  And the answer to every single one of those questions was basically the same answer. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=265.44s)]
*  I mean, look, I'll just show you what I mean. Do you approve of Trump's handling of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=272.24s)]
*  jobs and the economy? No, by a 12 point margin. Do you approve of Trump's handling [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=275.32s)]
*  of trade? No, 16 point margin. Do you approve of his handling of inflation? No. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=279.64s)]
*  Do you approve of his handling of immigration? No. Do you approve of Trump's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=284.44s)]
*  handling of foreign policy? No. National security? No. Education? No. Crime? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=287.64s)]
*  How about crime? No, not crime either. Do you believe Donald Trump should bring [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=292.76s)]
*  Abrigo Garcia back to the United States? Yes. Yes. Americans say Trump should bring [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  Mr. Abrigo Garcia back to the U.S. and they say so emphatically by a 22 point [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=304.48s)]
*  margin. Quote, since President Trump took office again this year, have his actions [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=309.16s)]
*  on the economy helped or hurt the United States? Hurt by a 33 point margin. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=315.32s)]
*  Do you think Donald Trump has the temperament to be the president? No, by a 10 [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=322.44s)]
*  point margin. Are you confident in Donald Trump's ability to deal wisely with an [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=326.88s)]
*  international crisis? No, 13 point margin. Are you satisfied with what Trump has [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=330.72s)]
*  accomplished in his first 100 days as president? No, 15 point margin. Trump has [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=335.36s)]
*  been president for about 100 days. Has he performed better or worse than you [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  expected when he became president? Worse by a 17 point margin. Since President [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=345.64000000000004s)]
*  Trump took office, has his behavior in the United States, excuse me, has his [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  behavior in the White House helped or hurt the United States? Not just the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=354.72s)]
*  economy, but has he hurt the nation? Hurt. Has he helped or hurt? He has hurt [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=358.72s)]
*  the nation, Americans say, by a 24 point margin. Other than that, Mr. President, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=367.0s)]
*  how's your first 100 days been? A couple more. This is interesting. NBC News has [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  brand new polling on young people's views. People age 18 to 29. People age 18 [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=383.68s)]
*  to 29 disapprove of Trump's handling of inflation and the cost of living by a 39 [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=389.88s)]
*  point margin. People age 18 to 29 disapprove of Trump deporting people for [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=396.44s)]
*  participating in protests about Israel's actions in Gaza. They disapprove of that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=402.64s)]
*  by a 52 point margin. And look at this. Should people in the U.S. who hold [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=407.64s)]
*  student visas, work visas and green cards be given due process protections [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=414.0s)]
*  when facing criminal or civil charges? Should they get due process protections? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=419.47999999999996s)]
*  92% say yes. 92%. I don't know, maybe they might be overestimating the appeal [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=425.47999999999996s)]
*  of performatively cruel, tyrannical secret police snatch and grabs off [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=434.6s)]
*  American streets. Yeah, funny, they thought Americans would love that. Turns out [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=438.36s)]
*  Americans do not love that. Okay, one more. This is the Pew poll. And this one [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  is put together a little different than the others in terms of the type of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=451.6s)]
*  questions they're asking. And you'll see what I mean when I give you these [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=454.20000000000005s)]
*  questions. But again, I'll tell you the bottom line here. The answers for Trump [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=457.20000000000005s)]
*  are all the same as those ones that I just read. None of it is good for him. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=462.0s)]
*  Just look at this. This is the Pew poll. When it comes to cuts the Trump [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=466.4s)]
*  administration is making to federal departments and agencies, would you say [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=470.56s)]
*  that the Trump administration's approach will save Americans money in the long [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=474.32s)]
*  run? No, no. By a seven point margin. Do you approve of the Trump [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=477.8s)]
*  administration's actions to end diversity, equity and inclusion policies [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=483.04s)]
*  in the federal government? No, by a nine point margin. Do you approve of the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=486.64s)]
*  cuts the administration is making to federal departments and agencies? No, by [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=491.2s)]
*  an 11 point margin. When it comes to cuts the Trump administration is making to [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=495.24s)]
*  federal departments and agencies, do you think the administration's approach will [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=499.12s)]
*  make the government run better? No, by a 15 point margin. Okay, so this is all [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=502.32s)]
*  very bad. Right? Well, how about the Trump signature issue, right? The big [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=508.08s)]
*  splash he wants to make, the thing he wants to be known for, the thing he says [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=515.6s)]
*  is the most beautiful word in the English language, the thing he celebrated [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=519.8s)]
*  with something he called Liberation Day. How do we feel about that? Because [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=523.56s)]
*  that's where Donald Trump thinks he's best positioned with the American [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=526.88s)]
*  public. Do you approve of the Trump administration's substantially increasing [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=530.5999999999999s)]
*  tariffs on goods imported from most countries that trade with the United [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=535.16s)]
*  States? Do you approve of Trump's tariffs? No, by a 20 point margin. He does [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=539.7199999999999s)]
*  and the people get one big yes, though, a really big one. The question is, if the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=545.88s)]
*  U.S. Supreme Court rules that a Trump administration action is illegal, do you [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=551.36s)]
*  think the Trump administration has to follow the court's ruling and stop that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=555.2s)]
*  action? Americans say yes, by a 79 point margin. So yeah, what was that? What was [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=559.52s)]
*  the headline in the post tonight again? Are things falling apart for Trump? Yep. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=569.92s)]
*  Uh huh. Yep. On every front. And I mean that the top line takeaways in terms of [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=577.7199999999999s)]
*  how the country feels about him, it's just brutal. I mean, in that pupil, his [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HJnD7vUrY&t=585.92s)]
