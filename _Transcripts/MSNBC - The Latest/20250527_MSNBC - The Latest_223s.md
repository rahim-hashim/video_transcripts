**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU)
*  Today in Sean Diddy Combs sex trafficking trial a former employee gave emotional testimony about her experience with the music mogul [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=0.0s)]
*  Prosecutors say Capricorn Clark was kidnapped twice by Combs or his bodyguards and this morning [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=8.88s)]
*  She detailed how part of her job was to set up hotel rooms for Combs so-called freak-offs [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Including baby oil the drug ecstasy and IV drips [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=21.14s)]
*  She also said working for him was 24 7 stress that caused her hair loss [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=24.979999999999997s)]
*  NBC's Chloe Malasse is outside the courthouse for us take us through the latest from court Chloe [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=30.659999999999997s)]
*  Hey there Chris why was inside the courthouse this morning listening to this riveting testimony from Capricorn Clark [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=37.5s)]
*  And one of the reasons why it was so fascinating to listen to is because this is someone who has known Sean Combs since about [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=44.019999999999996s)]
*  2002 they were initially friends [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=50.82s)]
*  And then she held various roles working for Sean Combs [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=52.8s)]
*  She worked for him on and off for about 14 years and she took us to a time in December of 2011 and we heard [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=56.44s)]
*  Musician kid Cuddy talk about this last week when Sean Combs learned that his girlfriend Cassie Ventura at the time was cheating on him [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=62.44s)]
*  With kid Cuddy and that Combs was so incensed that he actually [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=70.12s)]
*  Allegedly showed up to Capricorn Clark's apartment with a gun and he told her you have to come with me right now [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=74.52s)]
*  We're going to kill kid Cuddy a quote from her is he just said get dressed [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=81.12s)]
*  We're going to kill miss gutty and then the gun was in his hand [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=86.12s)]
*  And that's when they got into a black Escalade and they went to kid Cuddy's home and kid Cuddy wasn't there [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=89.52s)]
*  We heard him testify about this last week [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=94.28s)]
*  But there are some more illuminating details about the fact that we didn't know that there was a car chase between the two of them [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=97.02000000000001s)]
*  So we're hearing a more complete picture, but then she went on to say something where you know [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=102.8s)]
*  You couldn't even hear a pin drop [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=108.16s)]
*  It was so silent all of the individuals that were watching this testimony is when Capricorn [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  Capricorn Clark said that after this incident at kid Cuddy's home [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  they returned to Sean Combs his home and Cassie Ventura was now there and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=118.6s)]
*  Combs was so upset that she actually had a burner phone that she had been secretly having this relationship with kid Cuddy [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=123.96s)]
*  That he began to violently beat her and that he was kicking her over and over in front of herself [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=131.56s)]
*  Capricorn Clark and someone else from Combs a security team that she was in a fetal position and he kicked her with full force [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  From the front door all the way to the street and that she was so [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  Concerned for Cassie Ventura safety that she called several members of Combs a security team [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  Begging them to intervene to call Combs and get him to stop [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=156.83999999999997s)]
*  And that at that point that she saw that no one was intervening she claims to have called Cassie Ventura's mother Regina Ventura [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=160.74s)]
*  We also heard from last week on the stand, but we didn't hear this story [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=167.18s)]
*  Chris that Capricorn Clark called her and said, you know, I'm worried that your daughter might die [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  You need to call 9-1-1 and that's when Capricorn Clark left the residence and she said as she turned around [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=175.94s)]
*  She saw Combs [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=181.86s)]
*  He was continuing to kick Ventura as she laid in that fetal position and I just want to point out why this is all [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=182.82s)]
*  Important it goes back to the Rico conspiracy charge Chris and also the sex trafficking charge. These are all of those foundational [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=188.58s)]
*  Testimony that goes towards what the government is saying Combs did [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  Chloe mo off. Thank you [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=201.22000000000003s)]
*  You [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wjk183nEnU&t=218.58s)]
