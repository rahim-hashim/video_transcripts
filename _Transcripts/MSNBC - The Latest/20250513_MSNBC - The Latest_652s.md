# 'Monetization of the presidency': Journalist reacts to Trump's investment deal with Saudi Arabia
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4)
*  So, Peter, obviously, the president is still talking more than 30 minutes later. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=0.0s)]
*  There is some contradiction between what the White House put out and the signs that were [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=6.2s)]
*  there in Riyadh about how much these deals are worth. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=9.8s)]
*  But let's talk about the conflicts, potential conflicts from Trump projects to cryptocurrency. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=13.84s)]
*  And by the way, as the White House says, no hiding it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=19.18s)]
*  They have not attempted to pretend it's not happening. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=22.56s)]
*  So how are Americans supposed to wrap their heads around what's happening here? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=25.44s)]
*  And what risks are there for our country? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=30.340000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=33.56s)]
*  It is open. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=35.2s)]
*  It is transparent in the sense that nobody is pretending that it's anything other than [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=36.2s)]
*  what it is. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=39.38s)]
*  It's the monetization of the president in a way we've never really seen. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  We've never had a president who was doing these kinds of deals, whose family was doing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=45.88s)]
*  these kinds of deals at the same time that the president was in the White House. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=49.16s)]
*  The White House says that conflict rules don't apply to the president, that he can do anything, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=54.92s)]
*  basically, and that there are no rules that bind him that way. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=59.12s)]
*  And they also point out that, well, you know, this is his sons doing this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=62.56s)]
*  This is the sons who are actually managing—he's not managing the business. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=65.52s)]
*  But financial disclosure forms do show, of course, he has a financial interest in all [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=68.56s)]
*  of this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=72.76s)]
*  And, of course, his sons are pulling in, you know, enormous amounts of money through these [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=73.76s)]
*  projects. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=78.56s)]
*  And, of course, it was the same Trump family that complained about Biden's family profiteering [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=79.56s)]
*  off of his name. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=84.88s)]
*  But the amounts of money that Hunter Biden was involved with, if you found it offensive, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=86.44s)]
*  were a token of what we're talking about here, millions as opposed to billions. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  This is a family that is involved in all sorts of international deals at the same time the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  president is running foreign policy that directly impacts the countries involved. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  We know, going into this meeting, that the president, as I said, was pushing for a trillion [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=108.32s)]
*  dollars in American investments. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  Then they said $600 billion. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=114.96s)]
*  Then the sign said $300 billion. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=117.44s)]
*  How do we even know what the real, I guess, benefit is to Americans, to this country, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  from this relationship? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=126.8s)]
*  Oh, I wouldn't pay attention to any of those numbers. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=127.8s)]
*  They're all, you know, they're quite often puffed up. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=130.68s)]
*  If you actually dig into them, you usually find that there's not as much there as they [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=134.4s)]
*  pretend. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  I remember when he went to Saudi Arabia for his first overseas trip, in his first term, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  I was on that trip, 2017. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=144.72s)]
*  They boasted of hundreds of billions of dollars of arms sales and other deals. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=146.72s)]
*  A lot of that didn't end up coming through. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=150.24s)]
*  A lot of it's either smoke and mirrors or things that were already planned, things that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=152.08s)]
*  were going to happen anyway, or things that are dependent or contingent on things that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=155.24s)]
*  may or may not happen in the future. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  So I would be cautious about any of these kind of numbers, getting too serious about [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=160.6s)]
*  them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=164.32s)]
*  But obviously the Saudis do have a vested interest in the United States. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=165.32s)]
*  There is a large economic relationship there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=167.72s)]
*  What's really interesting is how, while the president focuses on money, in effect he's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=172.4s)]
*  putting Saudi Arabia front and center on the geopolitical front as well. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=176.98s)]
*  By making this his first trip, other than the quick trip to the Vatican for the Pope's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  funeral, he once again is signaling that Saudi is more important to him than a lot of our [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=185.44s)]
*  other traditional allies. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=190.4s)]
*  Traditionally, presidents go to London first or Canada or Mexico. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=191.88s)]
*  This president now has twice gone to Saudi Arabia as his first scheduled official trip [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=195.8s)]
*  of his two terms. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=200.8s)]
*  And that's saying that he means for them to be front and center. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=202.08s)]
*  He's using them as the intermediary, in fact, in some of these talks, for instance, over [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=204.44s)]
*  Ukraine and other issues. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  Now, David Schenker, he was a State Department official in Trump's first term, told The Wall [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=209.88s)]
*  Street Journal, quote, the national interest has seemingly merged with the president's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  interests in some way. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=219.66s)]
*  It's obviously a different way of doing business. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=221.82s)]
*  And as if to underscore that, Jared Kushner is there, a man, of course, whose private [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=224.82s)]
*  equity firm got two billion dollars from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=229.46s)]
*  Is it even possible for this administration to separate the president's personal interests [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=235.44s)]
*  from the country's by, as Peter points out, saying, well, it's the sons? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=240.82s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, as you alluded to, they're no longer trying to hide it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=245.61999999999998s)]
*  It's almost like they're flaunting it, with Jared Kushner being there with the latest [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=250.54s)]
*  with the cuttary, quote, unquote, donation of a $400 million jet. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=254.42s)]
*  Look, I don't begrudge a president of the United States going abroad in search of business [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=259.53999999999996s)]
*  deals that benefit the American people. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=265.9s)]
*  And in fact, I think presidents need to do more of that. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=268.06s)]
*  We need to have the leader of the free world on the international stage to show the American [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=271.98s)]
*  people what our partnerships and relationships around the world can accrue back home in terms [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=275.3s)]
*  of wealth and prosperity for the American people while also doing good around the world. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=280.82s)]
*  My concern, Chris, is that this is not that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=286.3s)]
*  When President Trump says this is all about business, this is all about deals, this is [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=290.3s)]
*  all about the bottom line, we have to ask ourselves, who's bottom line? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=294.78s)]
*  My concern, to your point, this is not about the national interest. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=299.73999999999995s)]
*  This is about his personal interests. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=303.08s)]
*  And we have plenty of evidence to point to, whether it's his transaction or his family's [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=304.84s)]
*  transactions when he was out of office, his family's transactions even in recent weeks [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=311.0s)]
*  as he's been in office, what he did in his first term, and even the anecdotes from his [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=315.67999999999995s)]
*  second term, including what was the first deliverable of this trip. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=321.26s)]
*  And that's the $400 million cuttery Air Force One jet. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=326.22s)]
*  So again, I think we need to very closely look at what the president is doing and how [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=332.94s)]
*  he is merging these personal interests with the national interests. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=338.02s)]
*  He has been quite adept at doing that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=342.9s)]
*  And ultimately, this trip is about, I think, accruing his own wealth, his own riches, helping [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=345.5s)]
*  his own bottom line, even as he announces some ancillary deals for the American people [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=351.53999999999996s)]
*  as well. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=356.38s)]
*  Well, I'm sure you heard this, Ned. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=357.38s)]
*  He said, the president said he'd be stupid not to take the plane. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=358.38s)]
*  But then you have the national review. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=363.26s)]
*  They had a pretty scathing take on it today. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=365.38s)]
*  Here's what they said, quote, This is a transparent attempt at an international bribe, a personal [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=367.26s)]
*  gift to the president to curry future favor, so much so that I don't see the point in pretending [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=372.82s)]
*  it to be anything but one. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=378.03999999999996s)]
*  So what are the implications of a gift like this? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=380.82s)]
*  I mean, the ethics rules, the emoluments clause, both for the presidency, but also for America's [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=383.21999999999997s)]
*  national security, potentially. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=389.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=391.42s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, one of the most important lessons I learned in life was was in the fifth grade [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=392.42s)]
*  when my science teacher taught the class, the saying there's no such thing as a free [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=396.65999999999997s)]
*  lunch. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=400.58s)]
*  It was actually in Texas. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=401.58s)]
*  So I think his exact wording was there ain't no such thing as a free lunch. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=402.58s)]
*  But this absolutely applies here. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=406.76s)]
*  There is no such thing as a free Air Force one. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=409.5s)]
*  And I mean that in a couple different ways. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=412.82s)]
*  The American people, if this airplane is retrofitted to serve as Air Force one is going to be are [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=415.66s)]
*  going to be left with a tremendous, a massive bill. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=421.34s)]
*  These are Boeing 747 jets. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=425.36s)]
*  But I think if you were to ask a Boeing 747 mechanic to look at the insides of Air Force [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=427.54s)]
*  one in some ways, it's almost unrecognizable because the entire thing is retrofitted to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=432.22s)]
*  have the most state of the art communications equipment, to have the most state of the art [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=437.58000000000004s)]
*  countermeasures, to have missile defense. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=441.22s)]
*  I'm going to interrupt you for a second if I can, Ned, because Tom is here and he's been [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=443.26000000000005s)]
*  reporting about this isn't just like you get a jet and you fly it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=446.90000000000003s)]
*  Like this is Air Force one. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=454.22s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=456.22s)]
*  To continue Ned's point, first off, the Air Force one, the 747 for so many years, that [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=457.22s)]
*  was the aircraft that all the other states wanted to have to be able to fly it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=462.22s)]
*  And of course, it's a projection of American power, American presence and strength, as [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=466.14s)]
*  well as a projection of Boeing and American manufacture. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=470.14s)]
*  But when you look at Air Force one, it's really a military plane. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=473.18s)]
*  That's what it's designed to be. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=477.18s)]
*  So to pick up with what Ned was saying, this is an aircraft that's not just for moving [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=478.4s)]
*  the president around and his staff and his family, as well as members of the press. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=483.09999999999997s)]
*  There is a sophisticated electronic communication package. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=487.62s)]
*  We're not talking about encryption here. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=491.14s)]
*  We're talking about levels above that. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=492.65999999999997s)]
*  Layers of encryption and communications to be able to command and control the U.S. nuclear [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=495.34s)]
*  forces and U.S. forces when the president is in the air or is it a way to get him out [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=500.26s)]
*  of an area, as we saw with former President Bush on 9-11, to get him to a place where [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=504.94s)]
*  there can be command and control so he's not tethered to one specific location. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=510.65999999999997s)]
*  So it has to be ability for that has to be on board this aircraft. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=515.18s)]
*  That's going to cost a lot of money. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=520.12s)]
*  It has to be able to defend itself against an EMP weapon, an electromagnetic pulse weapon [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=521.58s)]
*  that's a nuclear weapon detonated in the high altitudes. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=527.0200000000001s)]
*  If that was to go off on a plane that was unprotected, it would instantly lose all of [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=530.4200000000001s)]
*  its electronic capability, the power, the ability to power the engines. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=534.4200000000001s)]
*  So it needs to be shielded. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  All the wires, think of all the wires in this plane, need to be shielded to block that energy [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=540.14s)]
*  so this plane can continue to fly. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=545.46s)]
*  It's also got anti-missile technology that is readily apparent on it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=548.1s)]
*  If you were to look at photographs of Air Force One versus a similar 747, this particular [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=551.66s)]
*  jet we've been looking at images of it is the same type, 747 model 8, as the one that [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=557.26s)]
*  Boeing or the two that Boeing are building, I should say. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=562.74s)]
*  The fact that they're building this and that it's not occurring in their other factories [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=565.9s)]
*  tells us something about the workers on this. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=570.0400000000001s)]
*  They have a particular security clearance that goes above top secret security clearance. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=571.74s)]
*  They have to have special workers to work on this jet. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=576.82s)]
*  So the cost here, hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=580.0200000000001s)]
*  Ned, I only have 30 seconds left, but there was one suggestion that one way to sort of [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=583.34s)]
*  speed up the retrofitting of this is to lessen the security clearances for people working [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=587.82s)]
*  on the jet. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=594.22s)]
*  As someone who understands the government from the inside, your reaction to that? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=595.22s)]
*  Look, it would be the sacrifice of our national security for President Trump's expediency [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=599.5400000000001s)]
*  and for his comfort in the air. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=606.42s)]
*  It would be tremendously foolish. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=607.98s)]
*  It would be tremendously dangerous and reckless in terms of our national security. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=609.5799999999999s)]
*  My concern, Chris, is that when push has come to shove and it's become a question of expediency [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=615.26s)]
*  and comfort for President Trump and his team versus the needs of the American people and [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=620.06s)]
*  our national security, they have chosen the former at the expense of the latter, and I [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=625.5799999999999s)]
*  fear they may try to do so here as well. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNbsISaGN4&t=629.8199999999999s)]
