# 'Creating a lot of unnecessary fear': Latino civil rights leader on National Guard in L.A.
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk)
*  Joining us now is Alyssa Mireles, the deputy state director of California for the League of United Latin American Citizens. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=0.0s)]
*  LULAC is how it's often referred to as the nation's oldest and largest Latino civil rights organization. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=7.2s)]
*  Alyssa, thanks for taking the time. Let's bring this all back to where it started. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Vastly peaceful protests of ICE operations in the Los Angeles area. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=16.56s)]
*  How crucial is what these protesters are doing? How do you see it? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=21.36s)]
*  It's very crucial. I think that seeing our people go out there and provide their perspective and just go out there and be safe and really just advocate for our communities is really important. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=24.72s)]
*  And of course, we are also seeing some of the images of what it turned into, which wasn't peaceful protesting. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=38.72s)]
*  The president has called it a riot. There have been people arrested for Molotov cocktails. We've seen cars lit on fire. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=46.72s)]
*  We've heard reports of looting. So those are incredibly charged terms, especially in LA, given its history. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  Does invoking those terms further inflame the situation? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  They do. They do. And, you know, I think those might be some of the outliers, but we really believe in just exercising our First Amendment rights, but in ways that don't feed these harmful narratives. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=65.88s)]
*  So resistance, we know, that can take many forms, but we need to be smart about it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  It seems like the original purpose of the protest is now being overshadowed by the vandalism and the violence. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  How do peaceful protesters get the focus back on the original point? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  I think we just really need to encourage safety and just understand that these people are expressing their pain and they deserve to be heard. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  But just re-centering our focus and just understanding why they're out there and just being safe about it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=108.2s)]
*  Let's talk just about the broader issue of fear as a weapon. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=116.2s)]
*  We have the National Guard now on the streets of a major U.S. city and the governor saying that was unnecessary. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=120.2s)]
*  We've seen the Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary Noem, at El Salvador's Seacot mega prison. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=127.2s)]
*  So there's a lot of optics in all of this. Where do you see that leading? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  I think it's just creating a lot of unnecessary fear. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=138.2s)]
*  I think it's unnecessary and our immigrant communities are already facing trauma from these actions and from this situation. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=143.2s)]
*  So I think just de-escalating and understanding that this disproportionately affects our Latino communities. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=150.2s)]
*  Alyssa Merales, thank you very much for joining us and offering your perspective on what's happening. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=160.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DzF3dF_Fk&t=168.04s)]
