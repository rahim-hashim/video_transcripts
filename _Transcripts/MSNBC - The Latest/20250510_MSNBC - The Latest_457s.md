# Fmr. federal prosecutor warns of consequences of Trump admin. suspending due process for migrants
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs)
*  We want to bring in former federal prosecutor and MSNBC legal analyst Christy Greenberg. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=0.0s)]
*  Christy, first, can you walk us through what the Constitution actually says about habeas [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=5.44s)]
*  corpus and whether or not it can be suspended during a time of what is rebellion or invasion [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  and how you think the courts are going to react to this Trump administration's allegation [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=15.88s)]
*  that we're in a time that justifies suspending this right? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=20.1s)]
*  So Article 1 of the Constitution says that writs of habeas corpus are privileged that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=24.8s)]
*  shall not be suspended unless there is a case of a rebellion or an invasion that the public [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  safety may require that it be suspended. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=38.24s)]
*  So again, to say the obvious, there is no rebellion or invasion. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Federal judges that have looked at this recently in the case of Trent de Aragua have found [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=48.36s)]
*  there is no invasion. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=52.88s)]
*  That requires a military component that we have not seen. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  And public safety plainly does not require suspending habeas corpus. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=58.92s)]
*  Just taking a step back into what habeas corpus is, all it's saying is that these people who [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  are imprisoned get to challenge the fact that they are being presently detained. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=68.60000000000001s)]
*  And I've responded as a prosecutor to many habeas petitions. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=74.12s)]
*  Generally, they're filed by the inmates themselves, challenging either their conviction or their [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=78.44s)]
*  sentence. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=83.48s)]
*  Most of the time, there's not even a hearing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  Usually it's decided on the papers. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=86.76s)]
*  But I can't imagine a world in which any court would say that this very basic fundamental [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=88.72s)]
*  process of challenging your own detention should be denied because of their perception [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=94.56s)]
*  of an immigration problem. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  And just one last thing, if there is any authority to suspend it, that authority belongs to Congress, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=103.2s)]
*  not to the president. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, you also heard Stephen Miller say it doesn't have to happen if judges do the right [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=110.28s)]
*  thing. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=114.72s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=115.72s)]
*  Well, again, I think judges would look at history. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=116.72s)]
*  There have been four times in history in which the writ of habeas corpus has been suspended. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=120.64s)]
*  Three of those times there was a specific act of Congress that afforded that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=126.4s)]
*  The fourth time where there was no act of Congress, it's because the Congress wasn't [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=130.92s)]
*  in session because there was a civil war. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=134.6s)]
*  Well, plainly, we are not at war. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=136.8s)]
*  So I think the courts would look at that history and find plainly that there is no [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=138.36s)]
*  basis to suspend the writ of habeas corpus here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=142.24s)]
*  I also want to ask you what you make of ICE officials arresting the New York mayor at [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=145.08s)]
*  a detention facility. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=149.84s)]
*  We played some of what Alina Hababa said today regarding that arrest. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=151.72000000000003s)]
*  What is your take on all of that and whether this is going to be the first in similar cases [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=155.96s)]
*  if you see local officials going out and protesting some of these ICE actions? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  Well, Alina Hababa's statement stated that the New York mayor was storming the facility [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=167.48s)]
*  and that he was trespassing and that the charge apparently was trespassing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=174.64s)]
*  I have not seen a criminal complaint or any formal charges that have been made public [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=178.88s)]
*  here, but there is a lot of video that was taken from this incident. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  You have the New York mayor and other members of Congress saying nobody was storming any [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=188.2s)]
*  facility. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=192.32s)]
*  In fact, he was outside of the facility at the time. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  So given all that video, given all of these witnesses, I think the facts will bear out [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  what actually happened here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=201.44s)]
*  But just taking a step back, it's really hard to imagine a circumstance where you're going [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=203.44s)]
*  to have a mayor of a city seeking to look at a facility in his own city and being told [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=208.6s)]
*  that he is not only trespassing but going to be criminally charged and handcuffed for [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=215.44s)]
*  doing so. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=220.24s)]
*  This seems like a stretch by any measure. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=221.4s)]
*  And in other pressing legal matters, we've got a federal judge in Massachusetts is temporarily [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  blocking the Trump administration from deporting Southeast Asian migrants to Libya. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=231.96s)]
*  But at the same time, NBC News is learning the Trump administration is planning to charter [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=237.96s)]
*  a plane on Monday to bring white South African refugees to the United States. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=241.8s)]
*  So could that be used to undercut the administration's argument in court that they are under duress [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=247.4s)]
*  from this onslaught of migration if they are extending refugee status to a select few from [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=253.68s)]
*  a select country? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=260.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=261.52s)]
*  And Judge Murphy's order here was very clear. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  He said that any migrants must be provided at least 15 days to contest their deportations [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=267.52s)]
*  to countries other than the countries that they came from. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=275.04s)]
*  And so this idea that you would be deporting a number of individuals whose country of origin [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=278.6s)]
*  was in Asia and sending them to Africa without that 15-day process, that would be a clear [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=284.2s)]
*  violation of the court's orders. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=290.88s)]
*  And so when these lawyers went to the judge, the judge stated, yes, you cannot just send [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=293.64s)]
*  them abroad without that process. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  That would be in violation of my order. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=301.32s)]
*  I think it's also worth noting why Libya, I mean, Amnesty International has held that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=303.88s)]
*  Libya is a hellscape, the migration facilities in particular, there is sexual violence of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=310.92s)]
*  adults and of children. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=317.32s)]
*  So this seems to plainly be a move to make people scared, have this climate of fear around [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=318.92s)]
*  undocumented immigrants that they will leave voluntarily. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=325.72s)]
*  And it's very troubling. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  What also is troubling is the claims from these lawyers that these migrants were being [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=331.47999999999996s)]
*  told that they had to sign a way that they would consent to going to Libya and that if [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=337.64s)]
*  they weren't, they were then put in solitary confinement. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=342.84s)]
*  That is plainly improper. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=345.56s)]
*  That is wrong. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  You can't punish somebody for not agreeing to basically sign your life away because that's [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=348.52s)]
*  what it would mean to go to Libya. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=353.0s)]
*  You're either signing yourself away to be tortured, disappeared, or potentially die. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, the irony there is that Europe is having a migrant influx from Libya, from people trying [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=360.84s)]
*  to escape the dangers and chaos in that country. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=369.24s)]
*  I also want to ask you, a federal judge is temporarily blocking the president's order [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=372.59999999999997s)]
*  to fire more government workers across 21 different departments and agencies. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=376.52s)]
*  The White House has appealed. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=381.32s)]
*  So what happens now and what does that mean for people who were previously fired or pushed [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=383.08s)]
*  out? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=387.48s)]
*  So the district court held that the president likely must request congressional cooperation [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=388.22s)]
*  in order to make these kind of large scale reorganizations of executive branch agencies. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=394.78000000000003s)]
*  And so there's a temporary restraining order in place. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=399.58000000000004s)]
*  That is a temporary order. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  So it is just going to mean for the next two weeks, these large reductions in force are [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=404.62s)]
*  on hold, meaning people will still have their jobs for the next two weeks. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=410.86s)]
*  In two weeks, the parties come back. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=414.62s)]
*  There will be another hearing, a preliminary injunction hearing, to decide whether or not [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=417.73999999999995s)]
*  that is more permanent. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=422.85999999999996s)]
*  But as you mentioned, there is an appeal that's being filed of this temporary restraining order. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=424.78s)]
*  So we'll see what the appellate court says in the interim. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=429.41999999999996s)]
*  But for now, these workers are safe. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=431.82s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=434.29999999999995s)]
*  Chrissy Greenberg, thank you so much for all that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=434.61999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJiCbFKUcCs&t=446.78s)]
