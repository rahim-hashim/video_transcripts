# House Democrat holds town hall on Trump's megabill
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ)
*  Now that President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill has passed, we're starting to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=0.0s)]
*  learn how voters across the country feel about it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  Lawmakers are facing voters in their districts, gearing up for the midterms by holding town [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=8.34s)]
*  halls, including one last night by our next guest. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=11.9s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Suha Subramaniam of Virginia. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=15.08s)]
*  So let's just get right into it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=18.46s)]
*  What were voters telling you? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=20.06s)]
*  I was at a town hall of yours a few months ago, and the big topic of conversation there [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=21.46s)]
*  was Doge cuts because you've got a lot of federal workers. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=25.28s)]
*  What about now in the aftermath of this bill passing? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=28.24s)]
*  Yeah, well, there's still federal workers who are losing their jobs. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=30.68s)]
*  That's a big issue. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=33.16s)]
*  State Department's most recent one. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=34.16s)]
*  But you know, I wanted to talk about this bill because a lot of people, including well [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=36.3s)]
*  informed people that watch your show, were there. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=40.92s)]
*  And a lot of people don't know what's in this bill. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  I mean, they know about the Medicaid cuts and the wealth transfer and the cuts to SNAP [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=46.2s)]
*  benefits. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  They don't know that this is going to make it harder to get and pay off student loans, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  for instance. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=54.72s)]
*  They won't let you directly file at the IRS anymore. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=55.72s)]
*  I mean, even in Virginia, they're taking away our space shuttle from the Smithsonian and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=58.44s)]
*  sending it to Texas because that's what those Texas senators wanted to do at hundreds of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=62.64s)]
*  millions of dollars of cost to taxpayers. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=66.52s)]
*  So there's so many things in this bill that are hurting Americans that they don't even [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=68.88s)]
*  know about. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=72.6s)]
*  And, you know, the president is so good at distracting people by going to alligator Alcatraz [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=73.6s)]
*  and doing all these stunts. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=78.68s)]
*  But even just the small provisions are going to have a huge impact on people. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=80.68s)]
*  So I just wanted to have that conversation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=85.36s)]
*  You said the things that they don't even know about. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=87.56s)]
*  I think that that's part of why, I mean, when we were talking in the break, you said it's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=90.16s)]
*  important to do these kinds of town halls because even people who want to be informed [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=93.66s)]
*  aren't necessarily on this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=98.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=99.44s)]
*  I mean, that's the onus on Democrats right now. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=100.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=101.64s)]
*  And that's what our number one job right now is to talk about what's going on in D.C., [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=102.64s)]
*  what's going on with bills like these and how it's going to hurt every single American. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=106.28s)]
*  I mean, even one woman said, well, thankfully, I'm not on Medicaid. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  And I said, wait a minute, even if you're not on Medicaid, your Medicaid premiums are [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=113.36s)]
*  going to go your premiums are going to go up on your health care and your hospital may [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  shut down. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  So this is going to affect every single American in different ways. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  And there's so many other provisions in this bill that I can just name any person at that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=125.61999999999999s)]
*  town hall and just say this is going to hurt you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  This is going to hurt you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=132.0s)]
*  And so there's something for everyone to hate. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=133.0s)]
*  Even folks who came in like that woman saying, well, this doesn't actually impact me, but [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=135.0s)]
*  I'm worried about my neighbor. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=138.6s)]
*  I think connecting that for people is important. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=139.84s)]
*  I mean, have there been creative conversations among your colleagues in the Democratic caucus [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=142.64s)]
*  about the ways that they can get out there and have these conversations with voters? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  Because, again, we were talking about this when we were on the air during Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=150.6s)]
*  very lengthy magic minute on the House floor trying to educate people about what's in this [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  bill. But like that is the central premise here. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=160.44s)]
*  Right. And I think for Democrats who have, quote unquote, struggled with messaging, are [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  there creative conversations about how best to do this leading up to the midterms? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, what was interesting last night is two things I heard over and over again. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=170.88000000000002s)]
*  One, where's the leadership and the Democratic Party? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  And what I told people was don't wait for a white night to come save us. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=178.36s)]
*  Everyone needs to be a leader right now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=182.8s)]
*  Every member of Congress needs to be a leader. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=184.52s)]
*  The people we represent need to help us and step up themselves and speak out. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=186.44s)]
*  And so we shouldn't be waiting for a white night to come save us all. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  And so that's really important in this moment right now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=193.66000000000003s)]
*  And the second thing is when we're talking about messaging, I mean, one of the things [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=196.08s)]
*  I saw was that among the Democratic Party, we had 20 different names for this bill. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  Right. They had one name, the one big, beautiful bill. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=204.32s)]
*  And I saw my colleagues calling it different things. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=207.04s)]
*  Right. And so having a United message is important. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=210.0s)]
*  And then sharing what's in this bill and why it's going to hurt people is so important. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  But we need to do that more effectively. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  And I think that's what the American people want right now, because they don't like what's [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=218.48s)]
*  in it when they learn. Because I remember hearing this when I went to your town hall [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=221.56s)]
*  a few months ago, this undercurrent, as much as there were concerns over cuts, it's [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  and concerns over the administration, real concerns. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=229.16s)]
*  Multiple people said to me, well, Democrats keep texting me asking for ten dollars, twenty [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=231.84s)]
*  dollars. I gave them all that money in November and I didn't see anything come from it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=235.76s)]
*  What would you tell those voters who still have that skepticism, who are wondering where [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  the leadership is in addition to the fact that you're saying, OK, everyone has to be a [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=244.56s)]
*  leader. But I think they're looking for tangibles. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=247.88s)]
*  I mean, is there anything to offer them that? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=250.32s)]
*  You know, one other thing I heard that I agreed with at the town hall was that people don't [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=251.92s)]
*  just want us to be the anti-Trump party. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=256.12s)]
*  They want us to have a positive vision. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=258.52000000000004s)]
*  We do have a positive vision. We just don't talk about it enough because we get distracted [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=260.12s)]
*  by Trump and he's really good at distracting us from these issues, not just away from the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=264.04s)]
*  bad policies he's passing, but away from our own positive policies as well. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=268.56s)]
*  And so that's something, you know, the funniest question I got was, what's your one big, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=272.48s)]
*  beautiful bill, Sue, hasn't it? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=276.56s)]
*  And I said, you know, here's expand Medicare, right? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  I'd Medicaid. I'd make sure people have more SNAP benefits. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  I'd make sure we try to support our environments, more clean energy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=283.72s)]
*  And so we have to talk about that more as well. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=286.68s)]
*  It's an excellent question from a voter. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=289.08s)]
*  Those constituents are very smart and not just because they start their day with way [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=291.0s)]
*  too early. But we do love that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=294.24s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Suhas Subramaniam of Virginia. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=295.92s)]
*  Thank you. You're going to stick around. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dm6cCaAiwQ&t=298.68s)]
