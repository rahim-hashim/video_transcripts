# Why China feels ‘emboldened’ in its trade war with the U.S.
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI)
*  New today, a potential breakthrough in the escalating trade war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump and President Xi could talk as soon as this week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=4.92s)]
*  President Trump, we expect, is going to have a wonderful conversation about the trade negotiations [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=10.88s)]
*  this week with President Xi. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  That's our expectation. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=16.96s)]
*  And what happened is that people had to, in China, had to give us licenses for things. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=17.96s)]
*  And the licenses, we believe, have been slow-rolled. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=22.32s)]
*  It's something that the presidents want to talk about this week. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=24.76s)]
*  The announcement comes after days of verbal sparring from both sides with Chinese officials [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=27.64s)]
*  clapping back at the Trump administration, calling on the U.S. to cease discriminatory [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=31.84s)]
*  restrictions and President Trump's fiery attack on social media, where he accused China of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=36.28s)]
*  violating the trade truce meant to roll back tariffs. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=41.72s)]
*  Joining me now, Phelan Klein. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=45.64s)]
*  He is a China correspondent at Politico. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Good to see you again, Phelan. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=48.84s)]
*  So there is a lot of contentious back and forth lately. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=50.08s)]
*  How do you expect the conversations, the conversation, singular, between Presidents Trump and Xi [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=54.24s)]
*  to go? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=59.0s)]
*  And what do you think will be their main focus? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=60.0s)]
*  Well, I guess the first thing I'll say is I'll believe it when I see it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  You know, it's deja vu all over again. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=66.76s)]
*  This administration, President Trump and senior administration officials have said repeatedly [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=68.84s)]
*  since January that a call is about to happen. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=74.12s)]
*  Two weeks ago, the president said, hey, I'm going to talk to President Xi at the end of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=76.6s)]
*  this week. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=79.16s)]
*  It doesn't happen. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=80.16s)]
*  So clearly, this is a fixation of the president. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=81.56s)]
*  He really feels or believes that the only way to sort of bust through this logjam on [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=83.96s)]
*  key trade issues, that, you know, the agreement that they broken in Geneva last month isn't [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=89.96s)]
*  really working for them, that that's going to do the trick. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=96.32s)]
*  And it's unclear whether the Chinese feel the same way and whether Xi Jinping is willing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=99.52s)]
*  to sort of open himself up to a call that could go seriously off the rails, given the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=103.96s)]
*  way we see how the president behaves in those Oval Office meetings with heads of state. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  If the call doesn't happen, do you expect there to be an escalation on social media? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=114.48s)]
*  I mean, that can go off the rails, certainly. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=119.28s)]
*  I mean, clearly, this is something that President Trump wants very much. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=122.36s)]
*  So if the Chinese really feel that this is a make or break moment in which they need [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=126.64s)]
*  to placate President Trump, they need to give him some communication with Xi, in which they [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  agree to some certain compromises on both sides. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  If that's what it takes, then the Chinese will do it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=142.56s)]
*  But the Chinese obviously feel very emboldened and powerful. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=144.88s)]
*  I mean, unlike what President Trump says that they have no cards, Beijing feels like it [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  holds a lot of cards. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  And one of those key cards is our critical minerals, rare earths, which are necessary [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=153.68s)]
*  to civilian and military industry here in the U.S. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  And Beijing controls like 80 percent of the world's supply. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=162.68s)]
*  And look, there may be another card in their hand there, because yesterday the U.S. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=165.6s)]
*  Trade Representative's Office extended the expiration date for exclusions on tariffs [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=168.2s)]
*  for certain Chinese imports from May 31st to August 31st. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=172.68s)]
*  This is not the first time the administration has pushed back the expiration date. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=176.32s)]
*  Walk us through what these exclusions involve and what might have prompted another push. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=181.8s)]
*  Do you think the administration is using extensions as a way to bargain? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=186.72s)]
*  So I think so these are 301 tariffs. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=192.2s)]
*  So these are basically tariffs that USTR imposes on products that it believes are produced [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=194.56s)]
*  with unfair subsidies or just outright dumping by Chinese state-owned firms. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=200.4s)]
*  So these exclusions that they're extending for the next three months are specifically [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=205.16s)]
*  for solar power-related equipment, which tells you two things. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=209.2s)]
*  Number one tells you that despite the Trump administration's skepticism about renewable [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=214.28s)]
*  that there is clear demand, particularly among some red states, for those components for [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=219.68s)]
*  local industry. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=225.8s)]
*  And to a certain extent, it could be a sweetener to indicate that the government is here, that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=227.4s)]
*  the U.S. is willing to bend a bit in order to get meaningful back and forth at the negotiating [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=232.36s)]
*  table or in that call with Trump and Xi, if that actually happens. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=239.52s)]
*  We saw President Trump lash out at a reporter after they brought up that new term coined [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=244.12s)]
*  to describe the president's tariffs, taco, or Trump always chickens out. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=249.12s)]
*  Does this extension qualify as a taco tariff? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=254.32s)]
*  Do the extensions stop at some point? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=257.48s)]
*  I mean, the president's in the driver's seat here. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=262.08s)]
*  And so he's obviously being advised by USTR Greer, by Besson at Treasury. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=266.02s)]
*  But clearly, if we're looking for a strategy, it's hard to find. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=273.68s)]
*  This is clearly tactical. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=278.68s)]
*  And it's a short-term bid to try to shake things up because there's clearly a logjam. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=280.6s)]
*  And whatever they agreed to in Geneva isn't addressing the issues that the administration [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=286.44s)]
*  and what Trump himself feels are most important. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=290.8s)]
*  What happened to 90 deals in 90 days, Phelan? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=294.72s)]
*  From the outset, was that just some moniker? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=297.56s)]
*  Was that ever going to happen? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=299.4s)]
*  In the real world, it was always—that was never going to happen. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  And clearly, you know, we're dealing with a president who is all about the art of the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=307.72s)]
*  deal, the art of the impossible. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=312.20000000000005s)]
*  But this was just one or two or 90 countries too far. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=314.20000000000005s)]
*  And if you take a look at just the key countries—look at India, South Korea, Japan—you know, those [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=318.6s)]
*  are countries that there's hard bargaining going on. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=324.16s)]
*  And really, there's not a lot of progress, both because of domestic political reasons [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=327.06s)]
*  back home for those countries, but also because these issues are massive and you can't really [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=331.56s)]
*  wave a magic wand and get serious progress in a short term. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=336.36s)]
*  OK, Phelan Klein, it's good to talk with you again. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=340.04s)]
*  Thank you much. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=342.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPpNMqljFI&t=361.56s)]
