# ‘Absolutely a terrorist attack’: Friend of slain Israeli Embassy aide speaks out
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y)
*  Loved ones of the victims are so processing, obviously, all of this. It's such a shock. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's Sarah Milgram's grieving father remembering her and reflecting on the future that she [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=6.24s)]
*  won't have. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=11.24s)]
*  Sarah's a wonderful girl, and she was as close to perfect as any human could be. She had [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=14.36s)]
*  a passion for learning. She had a passion for the environment, and she had a passion [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=25.48s)]
*  for Israel. It's all gone. We have great memories, but the future is gone. That's what's gone. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=33.32s)]
*  I want to bring in Meredith Jacobs, CEO of Jewish Women International and a friend of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=42.08s)]
*  Sarah Milgram. First of all, I am so sorry for your loss. I can't even fathom what you [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=46.56s)]
*  must be going through. How are you, and what can you tell us about your friend? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=53.92s)]
*  First, thank you, and thank you for wanting to let people know who Sarah was. I'm reacting [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=59.6s)]
*  viscerally right now because this is the first time I heard that the murderer emptied his [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=69.44s)]
*  gun into Sarah. That's horrendous. She was. To meet her, kind and sweet, and was dedicated [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=75.08s)]
*  her life to peace and to building bridges. Her job at the embassy was the civil society [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=83.36s)]
*  coordinator. Her role and how we met was because she wanted to engage the community, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=90.8s)]
*  not just the Jewish community, but anyone who worked in multi-faith in creating partnerships [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=97.88s)]
*  and bridges. When I met her, it was soon after October 7th, and we met for coffee. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=105.36s)]
*  We started talking. She's the same age as my children, so I guess I connected with her [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=113.52s)]
*  the way a parent would. I hear how her father talked about her and how we all describe our [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=118.52s)]
*  children as the most perfect beings. She shared with me that she had just lost her entire [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=123.44s)]
*  that everyone she studied with on environmental studies abandoned her because of her support [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=130.72s)]
*  for Israel. I said to her, hey, we have a young women's network. We have these dynamic [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=137.52s)]
*  young women who are, it's about mentoring and skill building and networking, but they're [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=144.52s)]
*  also a group that after October 7th very clearly supports Israel. Check it out, maybe make [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=149.48s)]
*  friends. I think what gives me comfort right now is that in the 19 months since I met [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=156.64s)]
*  her, she did just that. The messages we've been getting from around the country for young [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  women, she knew the way she pulled people in. Sarah and Yaron were actually on their [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=170.16s)]
*  way to Israel to celebrate the wedding of a friend she met through our network. I guess [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=177.04s)]
*  while they were in Israel, they were going to meet his parents and from what we hear, get engaged. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=182.88s)]
*  And so to know that she had a community that loved her, that she had a partner who loved her, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=188.16s)]
*  I know her colleagues at the embassy have shared with me that they think of her more as family [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=195.12s)]
*  than as a co-worker. And that's who Sarah was. And devastating, devastating that it ended after [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=203.28s)]
*  26 years when she was just at the beginning of all she and Yaron would do in their lives [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=211.2s)]
*  for the betterment of the world. I think there's something profound about the story you tell that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  someone who lost her friend was so deeply committed to this bridge building, to a cause, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=226.16s)]
*  that that was something, she was, there was a price she was willing to pay. Do you think there [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=233.92s)]
*  is something broader? Because she, it sounds to me like she was in many ways an educator, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=239.36s)]
*  helping to people understand that idea of reaching across to people who you may disagree with. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=244.56s)]
*  Is there something broader she would want us to understand about the sacrifices people are making [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  in their lives to do the work they believe is necessary and good, even if they're vilified or [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  shunned for the choices they make? I'm so glad you're asking that. That's a story I don't [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=263.92s)]
*  been told enough. We're hearing about college campuses, but not about young people in their [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  20s and the anti-Semitism they're facing, the hate they are facing. One of my young staffers [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  has shared that at a previous workplace where she was the only Jewish staffer, she overheard [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=284.08s)]
*  one of her colleagues after October 7th say, well, what did the Jews expect? The hate that we are [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  seeing online from posting about memories we have of Sarah and about Sarah saying she deserved it, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=296.8s)]
*  it is terrifying. I have heard from young people who say that could have been them, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=304.88000000000005s)]
*  that could have been one of their friends. Sarah and Yaron, unfortunately, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=311.92s)]
*  represent how brave our young people have to be right now simply because they're Jewish, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  simply because they support Israel. This is absolutely a terrorist attack. He went after [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=324.0s)]
*  them because it was an event at the Capital Jewish Museum that's about the role of the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=331.84s)]
*  Jewish community in building D.C., that it was an event that was sponsored by a Jewish organization [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=337.28s)]
*  and that it was meant for young professionals who are dedicated to diplomacy and peace building. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=345.28s)]
*  And that is horrendous and very, very sad that our young people have to be brave [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=353.67999999999995s)]
*  simply because they're Jewish. It is unspeakably unforgivable that anyone has to be brave just [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=361.35999999999996s)]
*  because they are Jewish. And I can't imagine what this has been like for you and for your [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=370.08s)]
*  organization, Meredith Jacobs, but thank you for helping us to understand what was lost here. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=374.32s)]
*  We do appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrFB3oAV7Y&t=379.68s)]
