# 'Never thought I'd be friends with a pope': Clerical sex abuse survivor on Francis' lasting impact
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0)
*  28 past the hour as Catholics surround the globe mourn Pope Francis. Key parts of his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=0.0s)]
*  leadership are being examined. Pope Francis sought to make the church more open to the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=4.7s)]
*  LGBTQ plus community. He told reporters in 2013, quote, if a person is gay and seeks [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=9.64s)]
*  God and has goodwill, who am I to judge him? Pope Francis' leadership also came in the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=15.64s)]
*  midst of an institution, an institutional crisis over clergy sex abuse, leading him [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=21.6s)]
*  to create the first Pontifical Council for the Investigation of Sex Abuse in the Church. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=26.68s)]
*  Joining us now is Juan Carlos Cruz, a survivor of clerical sexual abuse who became friends [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=32.72s)]
*  with the pope in 2021. He was appointed by Pope Francis to serve as a member of the Vatican's [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors. Juan Carlos, thank you so much for [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=43.08s)]
*  being with us today. I know that you first met the pope in 2018. What was the purpose [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=48.36s)]
*  of that meeting and why did you hold that meeting? Yes, so I'm originally from Chile, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=56.44s)]
*  also from the U.S. So, but the Chilean scandal of sexual abuse had been awful when the pope [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=63.8s)]
*  visits Chile in January of 2018. I flew there, but the bishops did not let us meet with him. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=72.0s)]
*  And on top of it, Pope Francis said, you know, I think it's calumny what's happening. He [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=80.0s)]
*  went back to Rome, realized that nobody in Chile went to see him, and he sent a commission [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=86.64s)]
*  to investigate. They interviewed me and interviewed a bunch of other people and eventually invited [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=94.72s)]
*  me and two other people to stay with him in Santa Marta, his home, to tell him all about [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=100.88s)]
*  this. After that, he called all the bishops from Chile and told them that they had to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=106.92s)]
*  submit their resignation, which was unheard of. And then he and I started this amazing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=113.92s)]
*  friendship and he appointed me as his advisor and to work in the Pontifical Commission, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=120.2s)]
*  and it's been an amazing father to me, to be honest. And how did that relationship proceed? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=125.92s)]
*  And what were some of the things that you felt he taught you the most? And what are [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=133.92s)]
*  the things that you feel you were able to teach him? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=140.92s)]
*  Well, you know, I get emotional thinking about it because I never thought I'd be friends [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=145.92s)]
*  with a pope, let alone after what had happened to me, the abuse and all that. But I have [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=151.92s)]
*  to tell you that to me, I feel like that story of Lazarus, when Jesus resurrects his [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=156.92s)]
*  friend out of the tomb, that's what Pope Francis did for me. And so, you know, I admire [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=163.92s)]
*  him for what he's done for the horror of sexual abuse in the church or abuse of power or conscience [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=170.92s)]
*  and for those who cover up. But I know there's a lot to do. But Pope Francis was the one [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=179.92s)]
*  that paved the way. So the scourge of abuse is eradicated from the church. So we spent [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=184.92s)]
*  afternoons, I visited every month, our birthdays, I was there, I spent Christmas with him this [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=190.92s)]
*  last Christmas. And to me, not only he taught me about what an amazing human being he was [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=197.92s)]
*  to everybody, but what he said to, in Portugal, to everybody, the church belongs to todos, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=205.92s)]
*  todos, todos, to everybody. And he really believed that. And in a time where Trump is [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=212.92s)]
*  kicking out inhumanely those people that are immigrants, the poor, where people don't have [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=218.92s)]
*  access to health care, those are the things that Pope Francis taught me and I think taught [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=227.92s)]
*  the world and is his legacy. He was in love with human beings. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=233.92s)]
*  Yeah, I, you know, one of the many things that I was struck by was that moment, Juan Carlos, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=240.92s)]
*  and I know that you're aware of it and you remember that when a little boy who had just lost his [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=245.92s)]
*  father asked to speak with the pope and that little boy told the pope in his ear first because [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=251.92s)]
*  he was just crying and in tears that his father had just died, his father was an atheist, yet he [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=258.91999999999996s)]
*  had baptized all of his children. And this little boy asked the pope is and the little boy told [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=264.92s)]
*  the pope, and my father was so good, is he in heaven? And the pope said, how could God not [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=271.92s)]
*  but be with those who are good? It's so difficult for someone who is an atheist to baptize his [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=279.92s)]
*  children. It's easy for a Catholic to do so. And I'm just wondering, Juan Carlos, that concept, right, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=287.92s)]
*  does it translate and transfer into, for example, how the pope felt about the LGBTQ Catholic [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=294.92s)]
*  community? Yes, well, obviously I'm gay and one of the biggest issues when I first met him was that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=302.92s)]
*  the Cardinal in Chile had treated me awful. I was abused when I was 14, 15 and the Cardinal said in the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=312.92s)]
*  news, well, I don't think Juan Carlos Cruz could be a victim because he's gay. He liked it. And so can you [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=319.92s)]
*  imagine? Que horror. Si, si. It was terrible and Pope Francis was so aware of that and that's when he [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=325.92s)]
*  told me and it became breaking news and I felt bad because I thought I had revealed something, you know, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=333.92s)]
*  that he wanted to keep between us. But he told me, God made you like this. God loves you and you are part of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=339.92s)]
*  all this and the pope loves you. So don't, you're fine. Don't worry about that. And ever since, you know, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=346.92s)]
*  when Uganda was passing these horrific laws on, you know, criminalization of homosexuality and death penalty [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=353.92s)]
*  and Ghana wants to follow. I asked him, Holy Father, would you speak about against criminalization? I mean, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=362.92s)]
*  if stopping criminalization of homosexuality and said, absolutely. And he told me, let's write some talking [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=370.92s)]
*  points. And there's a picture there maybe that I'm writing the talking points with him in that little living room [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=377.92s)]
*  where we met outside his bedroom. And he had an AP interview coming up and with Nicole Winfield and the topic came up [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=382.92s)]
*  and he went on and on against the criminalization of homosexuality. And I was very touched because after I took some [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=393.92s)]
*  people from GLAD, from trans people who have been so touched. And I told everybody, look, you have only 20 minutes we have [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=403.92s)]
*  with the pope. And he was so touched and we stayed for an hour and a half. And he had tears in his eyes hearing these things. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=413.92s)]
*  And I brought activists from Uganda. And like that, I mean, this was an example with the LGBT community, but like that, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=420.92s)]
*  there's tons. Yeah. Juan Carlos, tough because of this extraordinary love that one can feel and sense towards, you know, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=428.92s)]
*  the pope. And what are you most going to miss? His calls every two weeks, his amazing sense of humor, you know, like his dad jokes. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=440.92s)]
*  He would I would say, Holy Father, how are you? Here I am sitting down, you know, like he always made funny jokes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=454.92s)]
*  And the fact that I'm Chilean and he's Argentine and we kind of had some like typical things and, you know, things that we laugh about in our [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=463.92s)]
*  countries and we would laugh about that. And we would speak about serious things. And and he told me about his life. It was incredible. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=476.92s)]
*  I'm going to miss him. Juan Carlos, Juan Carlos Cruz, I thank you so much for being with us today. Really appreciate it. Thank you, Jose. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=488.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi8cRLQh-0&t=506.92s)]
