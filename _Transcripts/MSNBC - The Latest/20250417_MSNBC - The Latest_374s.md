# DOJ releases documents on Abrego Garcia’s 2019 arrest. Why now?
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI)
*  Joining us now, NBC News justice and intelligence correspondent Ken Delaney, and NBC News senior [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=0.0s)]
*  White House correspondent Kelly O'Donnell, MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin, former [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=5.4s)]
*  U.S. attorney Barbara McQuade, and New York Times reporter Jeremy Peters. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=10.6s)]
*  Ken, we'll start off with you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=14.6s)]
*  What do these documents released yesterday prove or not when it comes to what we know [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=16.36s)]
*  and still don't know about Abrego Garcia's criminal history? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=20.8s)]
*  Well, they don't say anything about a criminal history, Ali. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=24.2s)]
*  They do speak to the fact that he may have been detained in a murder investigation some [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=28.36s)]
*  period back, although he disputes that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=33.12s)]
*  And they show that his wife filed a civil restraining order in connection with domestic [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=35.2s)]
*  violence allegations and then later dropped that case. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  But what these documents do do is shed light on why the Prince George's County Gang Unit [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=42.64s)]
*  and the Department of Homeland Security believe or believed that he is an MS-13 gang member. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=48.36s)]
*  And they lay out a series of pieces of evidence, one that he was arrested at a Home Depot alongside [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=53.56s)]
*  a confirmed gang member with a violent record, two that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  and a hoodie that had insignia on it that the Prince George's County police believe [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=64.26s)]
*  was associated with a gang. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=69.26s)]
*  And so it sort of fills out the picture a little bit more about why not only an immigration [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=72.6s)]
*  judge but an appeal in the immigration system determined that there was sufficient evidence [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=79.34s)]
*  that he was an MS-13 gang member. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=83.78s)]
*  Now obviously he disputes that, his lawyers dispute that, and immigration courts are not [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=85.34s)]
*  criminal courts. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=89.86s)]
*  There was no proof beyond a reasonable doubt here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=90.86s)]
*  But the question of whether he's deportable is not a question of whether he's a criminal. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=93.22s)]
*  Those are two separate things. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=97.78s)]
*  If the Department of Homeland Security determined that he was an MS-13 gang member and he was [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=100.06s)]
*  in the country illegally, then he was deportable. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=104.06s)]
*  Whether he should be in a prison in El Salvador is another question here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=106.3s)]
*  But again, these documents do shed light on why DHS believes he is an MS-13 gang member. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=109.78s)]
*  And Kelly, there had been many questions about why it took so long for DOJ and DHS to release [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  these documents. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=121.24s)]
*  Ultimately, they did it last night, but why now? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=122.24s)]
*  Well it's an interesting question because clearly these documents were in the possession, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=126.02s)]
*  were a part of the kind of planning of this case, and presumably could have been released [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=130.46s)]
*  earlier. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=136.98s)]
*  It may be that they felt enough public pressure because of the interest in this case, the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  questions being raised, the way that Abrego Garcia and his family, the advocates for him, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=143.18s)]
*  had positioned him. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=150.06s)]
*  They do a lot of scrutiny here from the White House about Maryland Mann when they want to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=151.06s)]
*  argue that he is unlawfully formerly a resident of Maryland and won't come back. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=155.98s)]
*  So perhaps the timing was to counter some of that to try to recapture a bit of the narrative. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=160.98s)]
*  But we don't have a specific answer as to why they did not produce that information [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=166.57999999999998s)]
*  immediately, because certainly those questions were asked every day by reporters and others [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=170.7s)]
*  involved to look for more information about why he had been swept up in this and what [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=175.62s)]
*  was the basis, especially because of the rhetoric from the administration where they called [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=181.1s)]
*  him not only a member of MS-13 but a foreign terrorist because of the designation the administration [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=185.38s)]
*  has put on MS-13. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=192.29999999999998s)]
*  They accused him of being involved in human trafficking, a lot of things that are very [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=194.01999999999998s)]
*  potent words in the political climate, and they didn't have specific information to back [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=198.32s)]
*  that up. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  So it may have been a response to the public pressure. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  It certainly fills in some of the picture, and people will take from that what they want [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=208.18s)]
*  to make of his status, and certainly there is the ongoing pressure from people like Senator [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=213.74s)]
*  Van Hollen of Democrat of Maryland who are trying to keep this in the public eye. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=219.54s)]
*  The issue of his story is one part of it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=225.3s)]
*  Another issue is certainly is the administration following the law? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=228.54s)]
*  Are they complying with orders from the court? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=232.1s)]
*  Are they acting in the way that the president said they would, which would be to remove [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=235.18s)]
*  criminals that are here unlawfully as opposed to those undocumented immigrants who may be [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=238.74s)]
*  living in communities, may have mixed status families, American children, American spouses [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  as Briego Garcia does, and they would be a lower priority to deal with from the immigration [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  side. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=255.38s)]
*  Kelly, setting the scene for us, Lisa, from a court of public opinion perspective, but [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=256.38s)]
*  leaving us off on the legal foot because what is the impact of these documents in the instance [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=261.5s)]
*  of bolstering the government's argument within the courts, or does it hurt their claims more than help them? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=266.74s)]
*  You know, Ali, these documents are largely irrelevant to the legal issues in the case [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  right now, which is focused on did the government abide by Judge Zinnis' order, and specifically [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=277.38s)]
*  what have they done to facilitate Briego Garcia's release from that El Salvadoran prison? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=284.54s)]
*  Whether or not he is a criminal is completely irrelevant to the legal inquiry that's now [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=290.62s)]
*  going on. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=297.38s)]
*  I should also note that of these documents, and there are only 13 pages, only six of them [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=298.5s)]
*  were new. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=305.26s)]
*  Two of them were cover letters, and the others were both the determination of the initial [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=306.26s)]
*  immigration court and then the Board of Immigration Appeals, which is that administrative body [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=310.94s)]
*  to which immigration decisions are appealed before they can go then to a federal appeals [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=316.7s)]
*  court. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=321.53999999999996s)]
*  That's how immigration law works in this country. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=322.53999999999996s)]
*  Both of those decisions were already in the court record in the Abrego Garcia case. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=324.42s)]
*  They were there for the looking for anybody who wanted to look, and they lay out what [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=328.82s)]
*  the government's argument was on the basis of those Prince George's County reports about [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=333.18s)]
*  Abrego Garcia's initial arrest and detention. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=339.09999999999997s)]
*  And so not only are these of no moment legally, but they have been in the public domain for [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=342.9s)]
*  some time. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  This was a public relations ploy, not a part of a legal argument, Ali. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsyGUy6WsI&t=349.58s)]
