# Lights, Camera, Intel Briefing? Gabbard considers making Trump intel briefing like a Fox News show
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0)
*  Lights, camera, intel briefing? NBC News has exclusive new reporting that Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=0.0s)]
*  the nation's highest-ranking intelligence official, is considering a major overhaul [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=6.44s)]
*  of President Trump's daily briefing to make it more like his preferred way of consuming [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=11.4s)]
*  information. And that includes creating a version that looks like a Fox News show. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=16.28s)]
*  NBC's Courtney QB has that exclusive new reporting. Lieutenant General Mark Hurtling is back. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=21.32s)]
*  Courtney, I think in his second term, Trump has gotten these daily briefings far less often [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=26.88s)]
*  than his predecessors, but even less than during his first term. What more can you tell us about all this? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Chris. So we looked back at his public schedule and in the first several months [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=40.08s)]
*  of his presidency, that is from his inauguration until the end of May, which, of course, was last week, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  President Trump received, according to his public schedule, 14 presidential daily briefings. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=49.32s)]
*  Now, for perspective, during his first term in office, only several years ago, he received 55 [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=53.52s)]
*  briefings in that same period of time. And according to some of his other predecessors, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  including President Joe Biden, received 90 in that same period of time. Now, officials we spoke [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=62.96s)]
*  with said that the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, is very aware of the fact that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=68.08s)]
*  President Trump simply is not taking the PDB as often as he did in the past, and his predecessors [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=73.08s)]
*  have. As part of that and as part of her job, she is trying to look at ways to recast the PDB, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=79.0s)]
*  essentially to make the president want to take it more, to make it more of a form that he, the way [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=85.6s)]
*  that he likes to consume information. Presidents, according to the officials we spoke with, have [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=91.56s)]
*  taken it differently in every different term. For instance, President Obama liked to read his PDB [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=96.48s)]
*  while he was on the treadmill. President George W. Bush liked to read it in front of some of his [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=101.52s)]
*  officials so he could ask questions in real time. As part of these discussions, Tulsi Gabbard has [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=105.92s)]
*  reached out to current and former officials. One of the ideas that has come up, Chris, has been to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=111.0s)]
*  make it into essentially a newscast, to make it look more like the sort of information that the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=116.72s)]
*  president likes to consume. That is Fox News. Now, at this point, there is no decision made to actually [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  do that, but that is one of the discussion, or one of the ideas that is under discussion, Chris. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=127.6s)]
*  General, I wonder what you make of the lack of frequency, apparently, of what this president [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=132.0s)]
*  does in terms of getting his presidential daily brief and why it's so important. I mean, we hear [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=139.4s)]
*  about the presidential daily brief, but a lot of people may not know why it's given such a high [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=145.56s)]
*  priority by most presidents. Well, most of government is based on intelligence and information [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=150.16s)]
*  flow, Chris. And it's interesting to me. I find this a potential for an intel and friends kind of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=156.72s)]
*  broadcast to be very fascinating. And as Courtney said, you do, the intelligence officials do guide [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=163.16s)]
*  their briefings based on what their principal wants to have and how they want to do it. But this is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=171.48s)]
*  really kind of, I hate to use this expression, but dumbing it down quite a bit. When I was a commander [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=177.84s)]
*  as all senior leaders in the military and in government get, I used to get a black book every morning, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  and it used to really set my pace for the day to see what was going on in my relatively small area of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=189.88s)]
*  operation, which was Europe. What you're talking about now is giving the president an intelligence [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=196.28s)]
*  briefing, not only on a global environment, but also that affect all of his different cabinet [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=201.64s)]
*  officials like healthcare or treasury or commerce or in military. So you're talking about something [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=207.72s)]
*  that comes into the president that certainly has to be compact in its nature, but it can't be [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=215.2s)]
*  simplistic. And I think that's what Tulsi Gabbard is attempting to provide to keep his attention for a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=221.32s)]
*  short period of time. And it doesn't go with the back and forth that you normally see when you get [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=229.88s)]
*  intelligence briefings in government positions, because when you read something, you always have [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=235.24s)]
*  questions. If it's presented like a Fox News broadcast, I would be concerned that it wouldn't quite [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=240.44s)]
*  have the same kind of impact that you would see when you're talking to a bunch of intelligence [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=246.72s)]
*  professionals who are trying to give you the latest data so you can make decisions as the leader of the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  free world. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhVMjIt4f0&t=257.88s)]
