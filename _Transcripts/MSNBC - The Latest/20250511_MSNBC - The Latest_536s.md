# Newark Mayor Ras Baraka speaks out about his recent ICE arrest
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08)
*  is Mayor Roz Baraka, a Democrat currently running for governor of New Jersey. Mayor, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=0.0s)]
*  we can't stress how much we appreciate you joining us tonight. You and I go way back, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=7.04s)]
*  we've been through many causes together, including recently dealing with DAI and other issues. But [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=11.76s)]
*  please tell us what happened yesterday. Why were you there at Delaney Hall in Newark, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=20.72s)]
*  which has become a major site for Trump's migrant purge? How were you treated at the separate ICE [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=26.96s)]
*  facility where you were held for several hours? And how will you respond as the Trump administration [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=34.08s)]
*  issues more threats against elected officials who impede its deportations? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=40.32s)]
*  First, thank you, Reverend Al. I appreciate you giving us the opportunity to speak. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Uh, yeah, I was invited there for a press conference that the congresspeople was having. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=51.68s)]
*  It's important to note that I was there that morning and I was there at least three or four [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=57.28s)]
*  mornings before that, with our fire inspector denied entry. We served them a citation because [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=60.72s)]
*  we were in court. I left, came back for this press conference, you know, was there for at least an [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=65.6s)]
*  hour and a half before some folks from HSI came. Actually, the special agent in charge never saw [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=73.12s)]
*  the special agent in charge making the rest. It would be like our police director going downtown [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=80.48s)]
*  arresting somebody for jaywalking or trespassing. But he comes out and, you know, confronts me. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  Out of all people comes right to me. That's why I think it's targeted. You know, tells me to get out [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=92.48s)]
*  several times. I leave the gate. Finally waits till I'm outside of the gate. And, you know, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=98.0s)]
*  the agents came out, ICE agents came outside where I was and tried to arrest me there. And they did. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=103.84s)]
*  They arrested me. The scene got crazy. So I kind of acquiesced and allowed them to arrest me and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=108.88s)]
*  take me. They arrested you outside of the gate? Yes, outside of the gate. I was already outside, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=114.56s)]
*  but they arrested me. Wow. Now take a listen to Trump's border czar, Tom Homan's take on what's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=122.16s)]
*  driving you and other officials protesting their migrant pay, a purge. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=130.16s)]
*  These elected politicians know that this isn't about due process. This isn't about [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=134.88s)]
*  constitutional rights. This is about politics. They simply don't want these people removed from [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=142.48s)]
*  this country. They don't want immigration enforcement in this country. And that's what [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=147.6s)]
*  it's all about. They can stand out and scream all they want. They can trespass. They'll be arrested. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=152.0s)]
*  If they impede, they'll be arrested. If they no longer harbor and conceal, they'll be arrested. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=156.8s)]
*  What's your reaction to that, Mr. Mayor? Well, I think due process is politics. It's policy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=160.96s)]
*  Policy is a part of politics. Politics is what established the Constitution of the United States, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  is what established the Bill of Rights. That's exactly what it's about, about due process. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=173.28s)]
*  Whether we can disagree on immigration policy until the cows come home. But at the end of the day, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=178.32s)]
*  everybody has a right to due process. If you step foot on this soil, you have a right to the Fourth [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=185.12s)]
*  Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment. That's what separates this country [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=190.16s)]
*  from other countries around the world. Maybe he doesn't know that and is not ready to defend that, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=193.2s)]
*  but we are. Now, what's next legally in your case? And as importantly or more importantly, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  for the detainees currently in Delaney Hall, I know ministers and others, groups, New Jersey [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=205.28s)]
*  National Action Network and others are calling meetings to see what will happen to them. Are [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=212.56s)]
*  there any in there that are being detained that shouldn't be entertained there? What's next with [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=217.76s)]
*  your case and the pursuit of finding out who's in that detention center and who should not be there? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=223.12s)]
*  Well, on May 15th, I have a pretrial hearing. They're treating it just like a regular case. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=231.12s)]
*  I was arrested. I was put in a cell. I was given a mugshot, fingerprinted, charged with a federal [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=237.12s)]
*  crime of trespassing. I might add the police in there treated me pretty good, by the way. They [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=242.96s)]
*  gave me with respect and dignity. So I appreciate that. But I've been tried. I have to go to a [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=248.4s)]
*  pretrial hearing. Ray Brown is representing me. We're going to see this thing through. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=253.28s)]
*  I'm going to go back there and continue to try to gain entry with our fire inspector. I know there's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=259.68s)]
*  some protests that other people are planning coming forward. If I feel obligated to be there, I will. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=265.2s)]
*  And so this doesn't stop. The city is in contention with the GEO group, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=272.79999999999995s)]
*  and we're going to continue in court with them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=277.52s)]
*  Now, did you get any idea of how many people are detained in there and how many are there possibly [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=280.0s)]
*  wrongly or illegally and how many are there legally? Because we're seeing, if you think of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  the case of Garcia in El Salvador, where they admitted the federal government, he shouldn't [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=292.96s)]
*  have been deported. Do you have any sense of whether everyone in that detention center [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=298.08s)]
*  ought to be there? You see that? And that's the point of contention here. We don't know what's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=303.52s)]
*  going on in there. We don't know who's in there. They don't allow inspections. They're not complying [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  with the local laws. They don't have a certificate of occupancy in our argument. And we were in court [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=314.24s)]
*  arguing these matters. They feel like they don't have to go to court. They have a contention. We [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  have a contention. They have an opinion. We do. We usually solve those problems. And America, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=324.72s)]
*  through the court of law, they don't want to use the court. They want to use a decree. They believe [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  that what they say goes, that we have a kingdom here and not a democracy. And that's the problem. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  BALLERINI Now, I was deeply, I'm talking for myself, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  I was deeply disappointed to learn yesterday that while the Trump administration was arresting you [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  for standing up for migrants, they were also finalizing plans to fly white South Africans [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=350.56s)]
*  that they are calling refugees to the United States on State Department charter flights [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=358.32s)]
*  starting next week. They are organizing what White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller calls [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  a large-scale relocation effort for these white migrants from South Africa, even while they're [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=370.16s)]
*  terrorizing other mostly non-white migrants who have been here for years. It seems to be [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=377.68s)]
*  a very clear signal of the racial politics behind this immigration crackdown. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=384.96s)]
*  Doesn't that peer that way to you, Mayor Baraka? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=390.64s)]
*  BARRACA Yeah, I don't think they've been hiding it, though. It's just that kind of white supremacist [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=393.04s)]
*  authoritarianism that's happening. This country is slipping into authoritarianism. And we're [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=397.36s)]
*  watching it. We're watching them defy the courts. We're watching them lock up elected officials, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=401.6s)]
*  push pressure on large legal organizations, make it difficult for people to oppose them, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=407.28s)]
*  and attacking Black and brown communities, attacking DEI, now flying white Afrikaners [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  over here to the United States to find refuge where they do not refuge for everybody else, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=418.56s)]
*  from war-torn communities at that. I mean, this is very clear to us. It has always been clear to me, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=423.35999999999996s)]
*  and our job is to make sure we expose it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  Before I let you go, Mr. Mayor, radar screens serving Newark Liberty International Airport [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=432.56s)]
*  went black early Friday morning. The latest in a series of safety scares involving air [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  traffic control at one of the region's busiest airports. The FAA says it's working to fix the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  problem. Some elected officials have called for investigations. How's your city been impacted by [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=449.52s)]
*  this, Mr. Mayor? BARRACA Well, you can see that there's almost [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=455.52s)]
*  chaos at the airport. Every all this cancellation and delaying of flights. I'm actually glad they [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=459.36s)]
*  cancel and delaying flights because if they didn't, there would be more tragedies in the air. So it's [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=463.92s)]
*  safer, but it's inconvenient now because they need to hire air traffic controllers. They need to fix [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=469.36s)]
*  what's happening in the infrastructure, and they need to do some immediate things right now. I'm [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=475.68s)]
*  glad they moved off of this DEI thing and began to realize that there's a real systemic problem [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=480.8s)]
*  with the air traffic controllers and the airspace in our area. And they should. We do need to have a [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=485.52s)]
*  real investigation about what's happening in this region or in this country around FAA and air traffic [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  controllers. Absolutely. BARRACA All right. Well, thank you for being here with us tonight, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=498.64s)]
*  Ross Barack, Mayor of Newark, New Jersey, candidate for governor of New Jersey. Joining me now, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=503.91999999999996s)]
*  Ross and David 여러분 [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeN6wYaW08&t=515.52s)]
