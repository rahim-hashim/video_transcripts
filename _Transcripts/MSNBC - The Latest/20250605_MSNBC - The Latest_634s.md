# Musk alleges that Trump is 'in the Epstein files,' escalating their messy break up
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8)
*  Elon Musk just tweeted yes and amplified or retweeted a post that says, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=0.0s)]
*  President versus Elon who wins my money's on Elon, Trump should be impeached [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=5.98s)]
*  and JD Vance should replace him. He also retweets his original post saying Donald [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  Trump is in the Epstein files that is a real reason they have not been made [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=17.1s)]
*  public. Have a nice day Donald Trump. Again as a news organization we have no [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=20.3s)]
*  evidence of that but Elon Musk who just spent a lot of time with him is making [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=24.52s)]
*  that claim against him. Mara Gay brought us to the point that we are as a country [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=29.3s)]
*  as a public as an electorate dealing with the insecurities and and now [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=35.620000000000005s)]
*  malignant social media war between two men. Let me show you what Kara Swisher [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=41.96s)]
*  who's covered Elon Musk since the beginning had to say by way of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  explanation. This is an interview for a new podcast the best people it airs on [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=51.74s)]
*  Monday but we had some of it ready for this conversation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=55.54s)]
*  What is Elon Musk's trauma story? You know one of the things I used to say to a lot of people I [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=58.54s)]
*  covered because you can see that the trauma obviously lack of therapy we [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=65.14s)]
*  would have done very well if he had gone to therapy at one point but he didn't. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=69.46s)]
*  Bad person? No, no he wasn't I will tell he definitely had problems from the get [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=72.3s)]
*  with stuff around racism you know his family history is really quite fraught [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=79.74s)]
*  and so I think he had a lot of trauma and then he was you know he has [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=83.62s)]
*  obviously autism issues and he he's a creative person who's very deeply [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=88.08s)]
*  enmeshed in science fiction whether we're in a simulation or not very [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=95.02000000000001s)]
*  creative. Do you think he thinks that we're in a simulation? He told me that as he got [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=100.34s)]
*  more acclaim as people sucked up to them as inevitably happens with rich people [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=105.22s)]
*  are famous people most rich people now he started to believe his own nonsense [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=109.22s)]
*  and became overly dramatic at one point we did an interview where he said if if [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=113.9s)]
*  Tesla doesn't survive humanity is doomed to me I think that he he started using [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=119.06s)]
*  drugs quite a bit I think that's been well reported especially ketamine and if [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=124.46s)]
*  you've ever taken it which I did it's a very disassociated drug. So you [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=128.3s)]
*  understand the Trump? Oh what's he doing with the government? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think he has a thing in his [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=131.92s)]
*  head that he has this narrative in his head that the government is terrible. So [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=135.82s)]
*  Teddy that was this probably not as new and new to you as it was to me I was in [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=141.62s)]
*  shock about who he was before Trump welcomed him in and as Mara's alluding to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=148.22s)]
*  gave him the keys to the most impactful elements of our government all of our [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=155.06s)]
*  personal data the kinds of things that send a message around the world that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=161.06s)]
*  America isn't all one thing our soft power levers the federal workforce [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=166.18s)]
*  that's been traumatized by design what is this blistering fight with Donald [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=171.22s)]
*  Trump how is it likely to end? We're talking at 425 let's see where things are [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=176.9s)]
*  435 I mean exactly you know or 445 I mean the the reality is you know in kind [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=183.22s)]
*  of conversations today with some people around him they're they're not really [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=190.26s)]
*  sure what his plan is I mean I can tell you you know Elon Musk has been [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=195.42s)]
*  perturbed by you know this budget bill sure but he's been perturbed by other [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=199.78s)]
*  things that Trump has done that's not gone public in this kind of ballistic [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=206.78s)]
*  way so what exactly Elon's plan is is something that Elon's own friends are [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=210.38s)]
*  asking one another right now you know there's like a nervousness and a sadness [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=215.06s)]
*  that it's come to this you know I think the reality is he is motivated by [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=219.34s)]
*  stimuli and he is upset about things that he is seeing online and he's upset [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=226.46s)]
*  about some of the ways that Trump treated him on the way out and he is [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=231.10000000000002s)]
*  reacting there there is nothing more complicated or sophisticated beyond that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=234.62s)]
*  he is upset and has access to his Twitter account and is making that public [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=239.82000000000002s)]
*  I know that sounds very simple but that's kind of all it is I think we [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=244.94s)]
*  learned for the first time today that Trump at least said publicly for the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  first time today that he asked Musk to leave did we know that that it was Trump [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=254.94s)]
*  that asked for his exit I mean it is true that that Elon Musk was on a 130 [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=259.42s)]
*  day special government employee tenure which requires people to leave after [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=264.5s)]
*  130 days or not become special government employees it is also true [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=271.78s)]
*  that that is a distinction that federal bureaucrats have gotten around for a [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=275.42s)]
*  while and you can be do some creative accounting to avoid that I buy that that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=281.3s)]
*  that Musk was kind of wearing his welcome fin and you know clearly Musk [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=286.82s)]
*  also want to get back to his companies as he said very very publicly and you [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=292.94s)]
*  know that's why this kind of choreographed rollout was so intentional [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=297.86s)]
*  where you know Musk was doing interviews from SpaceX and he was doing meetings [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=302.26s)]
*  with Tesla investors in a very public way because he wanted shareholders to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=307.3s)]
*  know that he cares about his company so I believe all these things were true [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=311.3s)]
*  that that it was good for Trump it was good for Musk but you know now they can [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=315.06s)]
*  both portray this uncoupling as them firing the other let me show you one [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  more thing that Kara Swisher said about the future of Tesla and Musk wants to go [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=326.46s)]
*  to Mars and he's getting that that's what he want and he really does and that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=332.34s)]
*  is to me his ultimate goal was that and to get the regulators off his back it's [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=335.7s)]
*  Tesla in any way and that's gonna help Tesla's going down right now do you [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=340.85999999999996s)]
*  think so oh yeah and he stops being viable well I always say the planes are [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=344.58s)]
*  covered with the bodies of pioneers I mean they were a true pioneer in the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=349.5s)]
*  space I think the reason even though he blames these protests and this and that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=352.46s)]
*  and his stupid I mean he brought this on himself right why I these protests so [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=356.58s)]
*  stop blaming the protesters right Teddy is that the sense I mean the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=360.62s)]
*  market certainly seems to agree with Kara Swisher's analysis yeah look I mean [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=366.5s)]
*  this is this is a company that is a that is in a precarious situation to say the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=373.34s)]
*  least right I mean what exactly the future of Tesla is it is such a company [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=378.54s)]
*  that is so enraptured in kind of current policy fights I mean they obviously were [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=384.5s)]
*  apoplectic during the Biden administration that they weren't getting [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=388.86s)]
*  the love from a Democratic president that they expected to get from EVs and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=391.5s)]
*  then they became linked with this president who doesn't really care for [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=396.66s)]
*  EVs right and and and Frank in fact was not including EV subsidies in the big [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=400.3s)]
*  beautiful bill so you know this is a company that is so kind of dependent on [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=407.74s)]
*  federal government policy it makes sense that Elon would want to influence [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=412.62s)]
*  influence it but but where exactly does this company go given that they've now [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=416.5s)]
*  alienated certainly Democratic voters and maybe Republican voters now you know [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=421.14s)]
*  Angela I want to come back you know my favorite thing you've taught me is [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=427.62s)]
*  narrative dominance it goes away when a Democrat and a Republican are saying the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=430.86s)]
*  same thing about you and so I think the power of and I agree with you that at [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=436.08s)]
*  this point these are just words but the power of the words that Trump is using [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=440.56s)]
*  against Elon that he's mad because he didn't get his EV subsidy is not going to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=445.64s)]
*  help his brand I'm not going to bring anyone back to Tesla because he destroyed USAID [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=451.08s)]
*  he seized all of our government data for a tax break really that's not brand [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=455.88s)]
*  enhancing and on the other side the narrative dominance relied on nobody [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=460.84s)]
*  piercing Trump's dominance in the bubble the only person with more dominance in [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=465.04s)]
*  Trump's media ecosystem is actually Elon Musk who's who's picking a size picking [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=469.20000000000005s)]
*  he's picking JD Vance who's this prominent in the fever swamps of right [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=474.28000000000003s)]
*  wing and disinformation and conspiracy theories as as anyone and he's not just [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=478.32000000000005s)]
*  saying he's not just saying Trump should be impeached he's saying and JD Vance [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=483.68s)]
*  should be elevated yeah and I think you know I look at your character said it [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=487.0s)]
*  when she was trying to describe at least in part of to help explain and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=491.52000000000004s)]
*  illustrate how much talk to where he is is that he he he had he has a narrative [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=494.48s)]
*  inside of his head that he just can't get unstuck and he's living his life [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=499.04s)]
*  according to that narrative where to get that from we got red-pilled on social [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=502.68s)]
*  media for years and there are a lot of that is poisonous and that that gets to [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=506.28000000000003s)]
*  the core part of what you're getting to which is a few things one whatever the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=510.12s)]
*  outcome is over the long term one of the things that I really do think the Epstein [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=516.04s)]
*  thing is the most significant thing that must have said so far because what it [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=519.32s)]
*  does is it puts poison into the system amongst Trump's base that is a soft spot [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=523.24s)]
*  for Trump right now at least amongst his own supporters they are mad and feel [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=527.76s)]
*  like he's hiding something and that goes all the way back to that interview a [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=531.08s)]
*  couple weeks ago that Bon Gino and cash Patel did the FBI director and deputy [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=534.24s)]
*  FBI director when they said look Epstein did kill himself there's no [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=538.44s)]
*  conspiracy here people online were furious about that Trump supporters [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  were mad about that they what they turned on Patel and Bon Gino to say they [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=544.88s)]
*  want to have an answer they have a narrative that something really [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=549.24s)]
*  dastardly was done and that there's some shadowy forces covering it up and the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=553.2s)]
*  idea that Musk is now linking Trump to those shadowy forces is a very powerful [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=558.32s)]
*  connector to the narrative that a significant portion of his audience has [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=564.16s)]
*  and there's and there's plenty of other little soft spots too and he knows where [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=567.96s)]
*  they are and that's the key here because if you think about how Trump came to [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=570.96s)]
*  power that was a big part of how he came to power he came up and validated [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=575.0s)]
*  a lot of the narrative that a very large part of people believed and Trump said [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=578.92s)]
*  yeah sure I gave it to both sides and I didn't pay taxes because I'm smart and [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=582.48s)]
*  that's what rich people like me do we screw you so of course you need to hire [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZfiVdAyXc8&t=586.4399999999999s)]
