# Can Israel destroy Iran’s nuclear enrichment capability? Fmr. Defense Secy. weighs in
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE)
*  I want to bring in now former Secretary of Defense and former Director of the CIA Leon Panetta [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=0.0s)]
*  Secretary back in 2018 you told our sister network CNBC that if Iran restored its nuclear program a military response could be the only [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=5.2s)]
*  Option so Israel's just taken that step. So what now militarily and for future negotiations? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=12.92s)]
*  Well, the fundamental issue here is whether or not ultimately [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=20.52s)]
*  Israel can be successful at destroying their [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=26.0s)]
*  Nuclear capability and their nuclear enrichment capability and that's the question [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=30.12s)]
*  That is obviously the principal target. They've been able to degrade [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=35.2s)]
*  Iran they've gone after their military commanders. They've gone after their nuclear scientists [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=39.96s)]
*  But the issue is and it's something that I'm familiar with and others who dealt with this issue are familiar with [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=45.56s)]
*  It's very difficult to go after their enrichment facilities [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=53.36s)]
*  and their nuclear [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=58.66s)]
*  Facilities because those are really tough targets to get at so the question mark here is [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=60.86s)]
*  Yes, we're they're now hitting Iran, but are they able to truly go after their nuclear? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  enrichment capability I [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=75.34s)]
*  Think that is such a key question here [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=77.5s)]
*  But I think there's also an emerging pattern that could have big implications for the future of warfare [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=79.62s)]
*  Because we saw two Israeli security officials tell the Associated Press that Mossad smuggled explosive drones into Iran ahead of this attack and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=84.74s)]
*  Placed them near military sites. We saw Ukraine do something similar in Russia just a few weeks ago [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=92.38s)]
*  You were the head of the CIA, of course [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=97.5s)]
*  What kind of intelligence goes into an operation like this and what does it tell you about how what wars are fought now and in? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=99.5s)]
*  the future [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=106.22s)]
*  Well, we are seeing the future [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=108.22s)]
*  There's no question about it between what happened with Ukraine and Russia and now what Israel's doing to Iran [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=110.3s)]
*  It it demands a great deal of intelligence. You've got to be able to have [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=118.22s)]
*  individuals that are there that know where the targets are that can identify where those targets are and you've also got to be able to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=124.78s)]
*  Then smuggle drones [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=132.85999999999999s)]
*  Into these countries so that you can then activate those drones to go after targets that is [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=135.10000000000002s)]
*  That's the war of the future [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=143.58s)]
*  And we're seeing it [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=145.9s)]
*  We're seeing it in space right now [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=148.34s)]
*  With what Israel's trying to do in Iran and obviously what Ukraine is trying to do in Russia, but again [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=151.10000000000002s)]
*  the fundamental issue is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=158.38000000000002s)]
*  with every [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=161.34s)]
*  Attack with every military attack with every war. What is the ultimate strategy here? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=162.82s)]
*  What are you trying to achieve as a mission or are you just rolling the dice? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=168.66s)]
*  Yeah, and it's been clear in the way that Israel is talking at least about this latest wave of strikes that their goal here is to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=174.1s)]
*  Decapitate the nuclear program within Iran you present the issues and why there are barriers potentially to that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=181.34s)]
*  But the other side of this equation is the role of the United States [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=187.62s)]
*  You've been in the situation room countless times [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=190.9s)]
*  I wonder if you can give us a sense of the kinds of information that the president could be receiving [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=193.34s)]
*  During after an attack like this and also the conversations taking place behind the scenes to make sure that the US isn't drawn further into this fight [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=197.66s)]
*  Well when I was Secretary of Defense Netanyahu [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=206.66s)]
*  Threatened to attack as he has done on Iran [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=210.94s)]
*  And President Obama was very concerned about that. I met with [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=215.18s)]
*  The defense minister of Israel, Barack [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=220.34s)]
*  And I indicated to him that while they could attack Iran [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=223.7s)]
*  They could not really be successful at going after their nuclear capability [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  They just didn't have the weapons to be able to penetrate we did the United States did and so it was much better [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=232.92s)]
*  to to work with the United States [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=240.42s)]
*  In trying to make sure that Iran does not achieve a nuclear weapon and eventually [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=243.86s)]
*  Netanyahu backed off and did not take that strike. They've now done that so the question now is [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=249.5s)]
*  What is the United States? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=256.42s)]
*  trying to do in order to try to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=258.86s)]
*  Advance some kind of peaceful solution here [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=263.26s)]
*  President Trump obviously was negotiating with Iran. They weren't making very good progress [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=266.74s)]
*  Now with the war having broken out with these attacks that have taken place [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=272.46s)]
*  I think the chances for negotiations have pretty much collapsed [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=276.66s)]
*  So how does the United States now pick up the pieces and try to get the players back to the negotiating table? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=281.3s)]
*  I think that is going to be a very difficult task [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=289.38s)]
*  Yeah [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=293.26s)]
*  And those are certainly the key questions that we'll be asking of top officials within the White House as the hours and days [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=293.78s)]
*  Progress here for now former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Thank you for your time this Friday [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wy3x779ZE&t=299.82s)]
