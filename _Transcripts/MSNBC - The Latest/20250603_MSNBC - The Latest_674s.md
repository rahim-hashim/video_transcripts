# Sen. Ernst leaning into ‘MAGA-Trump nonsense’ makes her look ‘disingenuous’: Dem strategist
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4)
*  Back with us, NBC's Vaughn Hilliard, former Republican Congressman Carlos Curbelo, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=0.0s)]
*  MSNBC political analyst. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=4.8s)]
*  And joining me here is Julie Roginsky, Democratic strategist and author of the salty politics [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=6.72s)]
*  newsletter on Substack. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=11.32s)]
*  You never know, Julie, what's going to catch fire, right? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=13.26s)]
*  This has caught fire. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=15.42s)]
*  People are talking about it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=17.8s)]
*  If you were advising a Democratic challenger or even a Republican primary challenger, do [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=18.8s)]
*  you use this against her? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Does it show up in all the ads or you just let it play itself out? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=25.66s)]
*  Well, both, right? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=28.96s)]
*  I mean, what's the phrase? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=29.96s)]
*  The Lord helps those who help themselves. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=32.76s)]
*  And the reality is you have to help yourself here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=34.36s)]
*  And the fact is that this woman not only went out and said something really dumb for which [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=36.36s)]
*  she should have immediately come out and apologized and said, look, I screwed up. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=40.72s)]
*  I made a mistake. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=44.28s)]
*  This is not what I mean. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=45.28s)]
*  And moved on from this controversy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=46.6s)]
*  It would have ended up in Democratic campaign ads regardless, but it wouldn't have become [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=47.6s)]
*  the scandal that it is. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=51.88s)]
*  She hadn't then walked through a cemetery mocking people who are rightly concerned about [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=54.04s)]
*  losing their health care, losing access to their rural hospitals. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  And potentially losing their lives. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=62.04s)]
*  Losing their lives and especially saying, well, you know, if you believe in the tooth [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=63.84s)]
*  fairy, you believe that you're going to live forever and kind of mocking her constituents [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=67.76s)]
*  who have real concerns about this and about having access to health care and hospitals [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=71.36s)]
*  and about dying. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=75.32s)]
*  And so, look, you can't out Trump Trump. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=76.32s)]
*  And I think there's a problem here for some of these Republicans who think that if they [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=80.2s)]
*  go down the path that Donald Trump has, where he just mocks everybody and thinks everything's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  a joke, that they're going to have the same kind of Teflon reaction that Trump has. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=88.04s)]
*  And you can't. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=92.68s)]
*  He's sweet, generous. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=93.68s)]
*  They're not. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=94.68s)]
*  And this is not Joni Ernst. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=95.68s)]
*  This is so antithetical to who she's been her entire career that the fact that she's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=96.68s)]
*  leaning into this MAGA Trump nonsense only makes her look that much more disingenuous. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=100.64000000000001s)]
*  Carla, certain comments to reporters on the Hill saying that she is, we just heard her [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=105.12s)]
*  going into the elevator, that, you know, iconic elevator closing door shot. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=109.24s)]
*  But she said she's very compassionate. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  She wants to protect the most vulnerable, a far less sarcastic than the apology video [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=117.72s)]
*  she released when she talked about the tooth fairy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  Does that suggest that she now realizes this might be a problem for her? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=125.32s)]
*  Yeah, Senator Ernst has realized that any time you mix the budget reconciliation process, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=130.76s)]
*  when one party in Congress tries to exclude the other and health care, you get a very, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=137.16000000000003s)]
*  very volatile mix. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=143.88000000000002s)]
*  Democrats learned this in 2010 when they passed the Affordable Care Act just with Democratic [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=145.8s)]
*  votes. Republicans in 2018 attempted to repeal the ACA with only Republican votes, and both [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  parties paid a heavy price in the midterm elections. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=158.44s)]
*  Health care is a very sensitive topic. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=161.96s)]
*  It is best addressed in a bipartisan manner. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=165.48s)]
*  Republicans are again trying to go it alone by reforming Medicaid without any Democratic [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  support. And that is always risky business. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=174.28s)]
*  And Vaughn, you've got some new reporting about Ernst Challenger. Tell us about him. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  Right. J.D. Scholten, folks may recall back in 2018, he became a familiar voice even nationally [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=182.76s)]
*  because he nearly upset then Congressman Steve King and then Iowa's fourth congressional [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=189.48s)]
*  district. He lost by three points in the ultra conservative district. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=195.56s)]
*  And J.D. Scholten, he's still on the active roster for a minor league ball club in his hometown of [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=199.32s)]
*  Sioux City. He is a House member. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=204.12s)]
*  He would go on to run in 2020 again for that same congressional seat. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  He lost to Randy Feenstra by a more sizable margin. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=210.2s)]
*  But he was somebody who was on the campaign trail with a great number of those 2019-2020 [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=213.88s)]
*  Democratic presidential candidates, a popular figure in Iowa. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=219.16s)]
*  And let's be clear here, Iowa is not an easy state for Democrats. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=222.76s)]
*  Donald Trump won it by 13 percentage points back in November. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=226.84s)]
*  Joni Ernst, she won her last reelection bid in 2020 by six points. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  Yet at the same time, you saw Kim Reynolds, the governor, announce that she's not running [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=235.64s)]
*  for reelection this next year. And there is a Democrat, Rob Sand, the state auditor, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=239.56s)]
*  who is now running for that seat. Democrats are hopeful he's got a shot for [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=244.76s)]
*  the gubernatorial race. And now you're looking at J.D. Scholten, who I talked with yesterday [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=248.2s)]
*  afternoon, who said that he had been molding this decision. But after the comments were made by [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=252.28s)]
*  the senator at that town hall, he decided to pull the trigger and get in. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  I want to let you look at a statement that he provided me in which he says, here's my pitch. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=261.24s)]
*  I'm a baseball playing, monopoly busting, beer drinking, Bible reading, working class proud, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=267.56s)]
*  prairie populace who is a sixth generation Iowan from right here in Sioux City. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  I fundamentally believe we deserve more than a GoFundMe broken health care system, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=275.96s)]
*  a JBS food system, and dollar general economy. And this is where Joni Ernst, Bill Cassidy, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=280.35999999999996s)]
*  senator in Louisiana, find themselves in this difficult position of drawing the ire of the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=286.35999999999996s)]
*  president and knowing that there could even be a Republican primary challenge. There's still [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=291.32s)]
*  plenty of time ahead. And so for the senator from Iowa, she is already looking at a Democratic [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=295.88s)]
*  opponent, but there's still the question of whether there could be a potential primary challenge from [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  the right of her. Yeah, it's interesting, Carla, you know, as was rightfully pointed out, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=305.32s)]
*  she did win by six percentage points in the last election, but Trump won Iowa by more than 13 points [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=312.52s)]
*  last fall. So how vulnerable do you think she might be? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=320.44s)]
*  Look, she's probably not vulnerable today, but this is the midterm election in 2026 of a president's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=325.24s)]
*  second term. Typically, that is a very vulnerable position for the party in power. So you do tend to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=333.48s)]
*  see some surprises in those elections. If I'm prioritizing the map for Democrats today, I don't [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=340.68s)]
*  have Iowa at the top of the list, but there aren't really that many competitive states in the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=348.6s)]
*  state. There will be Maine, North Carolina, and then you could conceivably put Iowa in third place. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=353.08s)]
*  So if this does become a wave election, if the environment does turn against Republicans, this is [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=360.28s)]
*  a state that could end up being in play today. It is still pretty solidly a Republican seat and Senator [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=367.08s)]
*  Ernst shouldn't have much to worry about, but clearly she has provided an opening for Democrats. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=373.64s)]
*  Does Shultz's entry into this race, Julie, and the fact that it's getting a lot of attention, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=379.24s)]
*  it was in all the national papers, obviously, the Des Moines Register and the local papers [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=384.44s)]
*  have it as well, but does that kind of attention say more about her than it does about him right now? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=390.12s)]
*  Well, the roads of the majority for Democrats runs through Iowa. They need to pick up a seat [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=395.64s)]
*  like Iowa's, and that's probably the most pick-upable seat, as Carla's pointed out. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  Did she just make it more pick-upable? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=405.48s)]
*  Yes, I think she did. She certainly did. Her problem is she's facing most likely a primary [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=407.32s)]
*  from the right. And so she— [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=412.44s)]
*  You think that's going to happen for sure. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=413.8s)]
*  I think so. And I think what's happening here, unless Trump steps in, unless Trump wants to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=415.0s)]
*  protect her, which is why she's doing everything she can to cater to Trump. That's why she's voting [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=418.6s)]
*  for this horrible bill, obviously, which she should not be voting for. I'm not sure it's [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=422.52000000000004s)]
*  going to pass the Senate in its current iteration anyway, but she's already put her marker down [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=426.52000000000004s)]
*  that she has no problem gutting Medicaid because that's what Donald Trump wants. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=430.52000000000004s)]
*  She's doing everything she possibly can to avoid a primary from the right. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=433.96s)]
*  That's going to hurt her in the general. Look, Iowans are not Mississippians, right? Iowans are [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=437.4s)]
*  a lot more moderate, even those who are Republican are not necessarily people who are going to go [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=442.52s)]
*  over the cliff for somebody who wants to gut their Medicaid, who wants to close down their [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=447.08s)]
*  rural hospitals, who is making their farms basically go bankrupt because all the money [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=452.12s)]
*  that they were spending for foreign assistance is now no more. And so that affects their farms. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=458.12s)]
*  All of this is on Joni Ernst's back, and that's everything she has to contend with, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=462.92s)]
*  even as she has to please Donald Trump. And so that's a really, she's between a rock and [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=467.72s)]
*  a hard place. It's a hard place for her to be. Vaughn, I had the California congressman, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=472.12s)]
*  Eric Swalwell, on, and I mean, not big surprise, but I asked him how he was feeling about the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=477.08s)]
*  midterms and he said he was feeling very good about them. But I think overall, are you getting [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=481.96000000000004s)]
*  a sense from Democrats you talk to that there are more openings than they might have thought [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=487.08s)]
*  just a few months ago? Not necessarily. I think to the former congressman's point here is that [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=491.4s)]
*  the states in which they are going to have to battle in are exceedingly difficult. And [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=499.47999999999996s)]
*  Iowa was one of those places where, right, just last year that they were hopeful about some more [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=504.44s)]
*  pickup opportunities. And so this for the Democrats is going to largely in 2026, outside of some House [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=509.32s)]
*  races, is going to be potential of flipping the House. For the Senate side of this, this is about [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=515.4s)]
*  going to be keeping the margin at least close so that in the situation, much like this reconciliation [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=519.96s)]
*  package is going to face, that they've got to, in the Republicans' case, they can only afford to lose [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=526.36s)]
*  three Republican senators. And when you look at the likes of, you know, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=532.2s)]
*  is going to have her race in Maine, right, you saw the president already on social media early today [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=538.12s)]
*  attacking Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator. There's a lot of dynamics at play, but I would stop short [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=543.08s)]
*  of suggesting that Democrats are eager and excited about their prospects, at least on the Senate map [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=549.24s)]
*  in 2026. At the same time, who knows where the country will find itself 18 months from now, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=554.2s)]
*  and there is a lot politically at play that Democrats clearly have the opportunity to run on, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=560.12s)]
*  knowing that the Senate, the House, and the White House are all controlled by Republican majorities. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=565.72s)]
*  Well, point well taken. Things can change in 18 minutes, let alone 18 months. But, Carlos, let me [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=570.28s)]
*  ask you this. I wonder, given that the Joni Ernst story is moved into a fifth day, is there a warning [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=574.76s)]
*  in it for MAGA Republicans? Is there a line where, you know, I think as Julie suggested, you can't [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=581.24s)]
*  pretend to be Donald Trump? Look, there's only one Donald Trump. We have a governor here in Florida [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=587.24s)]
*  who tried to run a copycat campaign, and it really didn't work out for him, because Donald Trump is [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=593.96s)]
*  Donald Trump, and no one will ever be able to get away with the stuff that Donald Trump gets away with. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=598.84s)]
*  The irony here, Chris, is that a lot of these issues that some of these congressional Republicans [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=603.64s)]
*  are, you know, sacrificing their own, you know, political popularity for, Donald Trump really [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=608.92s)]
*  doesn't prioritize. Donald Trump does not actually want to cut Medicaid. He has spoken many times [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=615.24s)]
*  about all of these programs and saying that he opposes cuts. Donald Trump is okay, as he has [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=621.4s)]
*  expressed, with raising taxes on the wealthy. But a lot of these Republicans are trying to live in [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=627.08s)]
*  both worlds, in MAGA world, and they're also still firmly committed to their Reagan roots, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=632.36s)]
*  and you see that tension, and it is getting them into a politically tricky situation. But [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=637.24s)]
*  a lot of these swords that Republicans are falling on aren't even issues that Donald Trump actually [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=642.6800000000001s)]
*  cares about. Vaughn Hilliard, Congressman Carlos Curbelo, Julie Roginsky, thank you for a great [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=647.72s)]
*  conversation. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=652.76s)]
*  you [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6wevGS7U4&t=662.36s)]
