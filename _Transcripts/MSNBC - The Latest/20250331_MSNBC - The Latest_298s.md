# 'Where does it end?': Legal expert sounds alarm on Trump’s push to strip judge’s clearance
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s)
*  The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to get involved in the legal fight over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=0.0s)]
*  its use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove alleged Venezuelan gang members from the country. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=4.92s)]
*  This comes after U.S. District Judge James Boasberg temporarily blocked the use of that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=11.38s)]
*  act and then a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel agreed to keep his order in place. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=15.88s)]
*  On social media yesterday, Trump went after Judge Boasberg again, writing in part, if [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=21.28s)]
*  it was up to District Judge Boasberg and the other radical left judges, nobody would [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=25.46s)]
*  be removed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=29.86s)]
*  The president wouldn't be allowed to do his job and the people's lives would be devastated [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=30.86s)]
*  all throughout our country. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=34.5s)]
*  Trump also reposted a call from a conservative attorney to revoke Judge Boasberg's security [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=36.78s)]
*  clearance, which would have big implications. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=41.18s)]
*  Joining us now to talk through some of those, former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=43.900000000000006s)]
*  Katherine Christian. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=47.78s)]
*  She's an NBC News legal analyst. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=48.78s)]
*  So let's start there, Katherine. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=50.86s)]
*  President Trump reposting that call to revoke the security clearance of Judge Boasberg. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=52.62s)]
*  Can he do that? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=57.78s)]
*  And what would the impact of that be on the judge being able to continue in his position [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=59.1s)]
*  without a clearance? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=63.2s)]
*  Well, federal judges are not required to have security clearances by the dint of their office. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=64.7s)]
*  And yes, the executive has wide discretion over who gets the security clearance or not. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=72.78s)]
*  This might just be more blather. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=80.10000000000001s)]
*  I think the administration has talked about revoking security clearances from people who [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=83.74000000000001s)]
*  don't even have them. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  So it would be problematic if this judge was presiding over a case with classified information [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=90.62s)]
*  and in some way the administration swept in and said that he will not be able to review [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=98.74000000000001s)]
*  that classified information. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  Clearly that would be a problem for the defendant who's on trial. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=106.30000000000001s)]
*  But federal judges generally are not required to have security clearances. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=109.98s)]
*  But we've seen in the Alien Enemies Act case the way that the administration has tried [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  to say that they can't talk about certain details of this because of national security [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=117.56s)]
*  concerns. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  And so getting rid of his clearance might cut to the heart of that argument. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  But when you look at the way that the administration, allies of Trump, and of course Capitol Hill [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  has reacted to Boasberg and other judges halting or pausing actions from the administration, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=132.2s)]
*  they've talked about revoking security clearances, but they've also talked about impeachment [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=138.08s)]
*  or defunding some of these various branches of the judiciary. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=142.0s)]
*  What does that all do when it comes to the credibility of the third branch of government [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=146.06s)]
*  here? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, the problem is because the public is hearing this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  And we're talking about chilling the independence of the judiciary. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=155.34s)]
*  We'd hope that judges will sort of block all of that noise out and just do their job. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=158.8s)]
*  But it's very hard. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=165.28s)]
*  It's also quite frankly dangerous because most federal judges, Supreme Court justices [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=166.88s)]
*  have 24-hour security, but most federal judges do not. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=173.12s)]
*  They just go about and do their job. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=177.32s)]
*  So there are people who hear these basically threats of impeachment, and they may take [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=179.32s)]
*  actions that could be dangerous to the judges. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=189.14s)]
*  So it is very disheartening as a lawyer who appears before judges to hear the other branch [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=191.52s)]
*  of government, the executive, attacking judges they don't like. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=199.3s)]
*  If you don't like a decision, you appeal it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=202.52s)]
*  You don't publicly excoriate a judge. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=204.6s)]
*  And we've certainly seen that kind of violence as well against judges and their families [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=207.6s)]
*  in recent years. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=212.14s)]
*  But you talk about the chilling effect here, Catherine, and the president has continued [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=213.32s)]
*  to go after law firms that represent clients he doesn't like. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  Some of those firms are Jenner and Block and Wilmer Hale, which on Friday sued to stop [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=220.7s)]
*  the president from doing that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=225.78s)]
*  But others have cut deals to head off his executive orders. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=227.14s)]
*  Some in the legal profession have criticized that tactic. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  What are you thinking about this? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=233.64s)]
*  What's your opinion? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=235.04s)]
*  Well, I'm also one who criticized that the folding basically cutting a deal because what [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=236.04s)]
*  happens you give $40 million in pro bono service and Skadden Arps apparently has agreed to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=242.76s)]
*  do $100 million. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=247.22s)]
*  Those in two months, the administration says you're not doing enough. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=248.68s)]
*  So now you have to give an additional $40 million. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=251.6s)]
*  Where does it end? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  And the lawsuits, three different judges have now said that these executive orders are wrong [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=256.66s)]
*  and granted temporary restraining orders. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=261.66s)]
*  So fighting for what's right is probably the right thing to do for these law firms. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  Catherine Christian, as always, making these legal theories actually digestible for our [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=270.42s)]
*  viewers. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=276.06s)]
*  Thank you, as always. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=277.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtz13p26_s&t=278.68s)]
