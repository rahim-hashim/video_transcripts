# Judge says Trump administration violated court order with deportations to South Sudan
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs)
*  Let's talk about the other news today, Lisa, and that is the deportation flight of a couple [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=0.0s)]
*  of immigrants from this country to South Sudan. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=5.32s)]
*  Fill us in. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=9.52s)]
*  So, Katie, yesterday, the government took a flight of eight immigrants who had final [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=10.52s)]
*  orders of deportation, meaning an immigration judge had ruled that they were eligible to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=16.96s)]
*  be deported. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=21.76s)]
*  Usually, those orders list the countries that they are to be deported to. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=22.76s)]
*  And a federal judge in Massachusetts had previously ruled in April that the administration [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=26.4s)]
*  could not send immigrants with final deportation orders to countries not listed in their orders, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=30.64s)]
*  unless and until two things happened. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=35.76s)]
*  One, you had to give them notice in a language that they understood. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  And two, you had to give them a meaningful opportunity to be heard as to their fear of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=40.6s)]
*  persecution or torture and the country to which they were being sent. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=45.12s)]
*  Notwithstanding that, evidence has now been presented to this same judge that his order [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=49.22s)]
*  because these folks were given about 17 hours of notice before being boarded on a plane [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=54.8s)]
*  and taken to South Sudan, where none of these folks are nationals. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=59.04s)]
*  They are all nationals of East Asian countries, specifically Laos and Vietnam. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=62.36s)]
*  And there was this order in place that said you couldn't do this without meaningful notice [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=67.92s)]
*  and an opportunity to be heard. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=73.16s)]
*  What is the recourse? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=74.16s)]
*  The recourse here is hard to determine, right, because they are now in this other country. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=75.64s)]
*  However, the judge is telling the Department of Homeland Security, you may not let these [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=81.2s)]
*  people out of your custody. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=84.92s)]
*  You need to maintain custody of them. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=87.2s)]
*  And of course, the Department of Homeland Security, at least through its political spokesperson, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=89.08s)]
*  is saying South Sudan isn't necessarily the final stop for these folks, but she won't [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=93.04s)]
*  disclose where it is that they are supposed to be going. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  The judge, Brian Murphy, today, according to our colleague Gary Grumbach at NBC, was [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=102.36s)]
*  apoplectic about this, making clear in his view, in no uncertain terms, his order was [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=108.0s)]
*  violated and that he needs to get to the heart of who was in contempt of his order and whether [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=112.76s)]
*  or not there are going to be criminal sanctions for that contempt of his order. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=119.52s)]
*  Julia, why South Sudan? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=123.16s)]
*  Sudan, well, according to the DHS press secretary today, she said that these are uniquely barbaric [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=125.16s)]
*  individuals and that no other country on earth would take them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=132.76s)]
*  And when I asked the acting ICE director, Todd Lyons, if they had determined that South [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=136.8s)]
*  Sudan was indeed a safe country, because that is usually what they were saying, that in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=142.68s)]
*  order to not deport someone to their country of origin, you have to find a safe third country, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=147.24s)]
*  they said, we'll leave that up to the State Department. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=152.12s)]
*  Of course, South Sudan is a war-torn country. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  The State Department has a level four travel advisory where they do not travel advisory [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=156.96s)]
*  to South Sudan because it is a war-torn country. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=162.26000000000002s)]
*  This judge today said that most people who got a notice that they were going to South [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=165.28s)]
*  Sudan would likely have to Google it, to look it up, to understand where it was they were [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  being sent because they wouldn't have the knowledge to know that it is such a violent [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=174.2s)]
*  country to be sent to. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  I also pressed them today, would they be sent to prison-like conditions? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=181.44s)]
*  Is there some kind of agreement with South Sudan, like the U.S. made with El Salvador, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=185.04s)]
*  to put people in that notorious CICOT prison? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=189.0s)]
*  They said they could not say how they would be kept, but that it wasn't clear that South [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=192.0s)]
*  Sudan was their final destination. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=195.48s)]
*  I will say another thing that we learned today at this press conference is that they don't [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=198.83999999999997s)]
*  see, they said that these people were still in the custody of DHS. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  That actually is a problem for their arguments in these other cases about what they're doing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=208.56s)]
*  with people in El Salvador, because in that case, they argued they couldn't turn those [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  planes around, remember on March 15th, because they were out of U.S. airspace. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=215.88s)]
*  Now in this court case, Katie, they're making the argument that they're still in DHS custody, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=220.0s)]
*  and so therefore they have not violated a court order by deporting them, because since [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=224.88s)]
*  they're still in DHS custody, they could be brought back. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=228.96s)]
*  So what does it stand for? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  Is it whose custody they're in, or is it the actual geography of where these people land? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=232.88s)]
*  And we don't actually know where they are at this minute. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=237.88s)]
*  There was a lot of this court hearing that was done behind closed doors to get some of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=240.58s)]
*  that information, but it's clear that when this plane took off, the destination was South [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=244.28s)]
*  Sudan. That's what the deportation orders that we've seen look like. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=249.32s)]
*  And at this point, it's unclear what the fate of these people will be. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  But this judge says they're in violation of the order. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=256.64s)]
*  And the Justice Department has asked the judge to be more clear about what reasonable time [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=259.12s)]
*  means. The Supreme Court has talked about providing reasonable time. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=262.88s)]
*  Other judges have said they need reasonable time. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=266.2s)]
*  It's been defined as 24 hours or 20 days. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=268.2s)]
*  And I think the Justice Department is arguing, just define what you mean by reasonable time. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_lsIL_Lfs&t=271.28s)]
