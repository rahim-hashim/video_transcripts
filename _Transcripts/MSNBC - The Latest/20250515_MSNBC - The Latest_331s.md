# 'Not remotely surprising': Retailer warns tariff-driven price hikes coming
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k)
*  It's time for money, power, and politics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=0.0s)]
*  We just talked about the Walmart CFO's warning that consumers are about to feel the impact [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=3.64s)]
*  of Donald Trump's tariffs. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=8.68s)]
*  And now today, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that we'll likely see higher [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=10.36s)]
*  long-term interest rates along with what he called supply shocks. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=14.84s)]
*  Here now, Courtney Brown, senior economics reporter for Axios and co-author of the Axios [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=19.12s)]
*  macro newsletter, and Rick Newman, who is the senior columnist for Yahoo Finance. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Thank you both for being here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=28.7s)]
*  Okay, Rick, you just, two days ago, you wrote that Trump could have claimed victory over [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=30.099999999999998s)]
*  inflation if not for his tariff policy, which I think everybody agrees with. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=35.42s)]
*  What is your reaction to these warnings now from Walmart and the Fed chair today? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  They're not even remotely surprising. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=44.14s)]
*  I mean, we know what's going to happen here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=45.739999999999995s)]
*  We're talking about something like $3 trillion worth of products that we import from other [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=48.54s)]
*  countries. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=52.94s)]
*  There's a new tax on almost all of those products. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=53.94s)]
*  It ranges from 10% to 30% or 35% in some cases. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=56.86s)]
*  And when you tax a product, I mean, somebody has to pay more. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=62.94s)]
*  So everybody who buys these products, starting with the companies that import them, the wholesalers [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=66.14s)]
*  that buy them from the companies, the retailers that buy them from the wholesalers, and then [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=71.82s)]
*  the end consumers, you and I, who purchase those products, we're going to pay the tax. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=75.86s)]
*  That's just the way this tax works. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=81.34s)]
*  We're going to see price increases on imported goods that are more or less in line with whatever [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=84.16s)]
*  the new tariff is. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=90.0s)]
*  It's going to be clothing from China. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=91.8s)]
*  It's going to be leather goods, handbags. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  It's going to be automobiles. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=95.14s)]
*  It's going to be pharmaceuticals. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=96.64s)]
*  The cost of automobiles is going to go up, which means the cost of car insurance is going [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=98.32s)]
*  to go up. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=101.74s)]
*  And none of this is surprising because it's just a direct reaction to the tariffs. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=102.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=107.88s)]
*  So, Courtney, Rick is right. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=108.88s)]
*  The things are going up. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=110.92s)]
*  In your latest newsletter, you talk about how basically the recession fears they have [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=112.96s)]
*  not yet materialized. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  So maybe is this more like a vibe session, if you will? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  Maybe the recession may never materialize. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=124.88s)]
*  I remember we have been warning about a recession, it seems like, for years now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=126.32s)]
*  Yet, how the consumers feel, what they are being hit with when they go to the grocery [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  store, when they try to pay for their car insurance, buy a car, when they're looking [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=135.84s)]
*  out, the prices they're seeing are in fact higher. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=139.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=143.16s)]
*  So I think the difference between the vibe session, which was very 2022, 2023, 2024, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=144.16s)]
*  is we knew there was an inflation problem. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=151.4s)]
*  The line was moving clearly in one direction. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=153.94s)]
*  Now we see inflation actually cooling for now. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=157.24s)]
*  Consumers are still upset about the fact that prices are higher. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=161.72s)]
*  So they don't really care about the rate of prices going up. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=165.04s)]
*  They care about the price level. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=167.72s)]
*  And now they're preparing for what might be another inflation shock. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=170.8s)]
*  And I think we're not seeing it in the hard data. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=175.96s)]
*  The inflation numbers right now look good. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=178.88s)]
*  We had a whole data dump today and no one on Wall Street cared. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=180.82s)]
*  It wasn't the story. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=185.0s)]
*  The story was what Wal-Mart said. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=186.12s)]
*  And I feel like that just says everything about this moment that we're in. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=188.04s)]
*  It's not the vibe session economy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  I think it's more like the anecdote economy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=194.76s)]
*  The anecdotes, the warnings from Wal-Mart, they tell the story about what's happening [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=197.12s)]
*  in the economy right now, not necessarily CPI or PPI or all those alphabet soup of indicators [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  we usually watch. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, Rick, I mean, if the world's largest retailer cannot afford to absorb tariff costs, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  where does that leave small businesses? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=214.52s)]
*  Where does that leave the restaurants? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=216.08s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't say they can't afford to absorb them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  I think Wal-Mart could, but Wal-Mart has an obligation. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's a publicly owned company with public shareholders. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=225.44s)]
*  I mean, millions of shareholders. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  And Wal-Mart has an obligation to maximize profits. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=230.11999999999998s)]
*  That's just what publicly owned companies have to do. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=232.67999999999998s)]
*  Small businesses, it depends what they sell, but they have the same problem. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=236.11999999999998s)]
*  In many cases, small businesses have smaller profit margins. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=241.88s)]
*  Sometimes they can pass higher costs right on to consumers, their own customers, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=245.72s)]
*  depending on whether those customers must have their products. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=250.44s)]
*  And sometimes they can't. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=254.76s)]
*  If it's a tchotchke that maybe somebody would like to buy but doesn't, and it goes up by 10 or 20 percent, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=256.0s)]
*  that could be the difference right there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=262.96s)]
*  You know, a lot of these businesses, small businesses don't have huge profit margins in general. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=264.72s)]
*  So if somebody just comes along and arbitrarily says, I'm going to raise your cost by 10 or 20 percent, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=272.48s)]
*  that can be a huge problem for them. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=278.76s)]
*  I mean, they cannot automatically go to a bank and get an extra million dollar loan. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  By the way, small businesses, they have to pay import tariffs the moment they take that merchandise, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=287.2s)]
*  way before they sell it, way before they even know whether they're going to be able to raise their own prices to their consumers. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=292.76s)]
*  That's a cash flow problem for companies that can't just go to JPMorgan and say, increase my credit line by 10 million dollars. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=299.24s)]
*  So this is really roiling small businesses in ways that I think Donald Trump doesn't appreciate. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuCI2__l5k&t=305.88s)]
