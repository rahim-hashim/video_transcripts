# 'Finally seeing the real Putin': McFaul reacts to Trump's comments on Russian attack
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA)
*  Joining us now is former U.S. Ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration, Michael [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=0.0s)]
*  McFaul. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=4.32s)]
*  Ambassador, first, what do you make of the Kremlin's response to Trump's comments, and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=5.32s)]
*  what could they mean in the larger landscape of suing for peace talks? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=8.6s)]
*  Well, the president has lashed out before on social media and public against Putin. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=12.6s)]
*  That's something new. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=19.36s)]
*  He didn't do that before in his first term. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=20.36s)]
*  I think he's wrong analytically. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=22.68s)]
*  I don't think Putin's changed. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=24.28s)]
*  I think Trump is finally just seeing the real Putin. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=25.52s)]
*  What I have to say, tough words on social media is not the same as actions. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=29.28s)]
*  Time and time again, the president sounds really tough, and he's going to do all kinds [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=35.68s)]
*  of tough things on social media, and he doesn't follow through. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  The Russians and Vladimir Putin are not threatened by his words. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=43.96s)]
*  He needs to be credible and actually do the things he promises to do. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=49.52s)]
*  Other words, otherwise, the president looks extremely weak. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=54.2s)]
*  I think you bring up a good point there, that talk is different than actions, and we should [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  also point out that as much as the president was criticizing Putin in that post, he also [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=62.68s)]
*  included a little jab for Ukraine's Zelensky as well. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=67.28s)]
*  But look, the thinking here has been that Russia's been buying itself time, keeping [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  ceasefire talks alive while still behaving aggressively. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=74.84s)]
*  But does this kind of language from Putin signal that maybe they're ready for the U.S. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=78.56s)]
*  to walk away? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=82.24s)]
*  I think Putin at this point could care less about the United States. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=85.0s)]
*  He has never signaled once that he's serious about negotiations. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=88.36s)]
*  He has doubled down and just emphasized the same war objectives that he outlined in 2022. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=92.84s)]
*  And if anything, he's escalated those aims. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=100.44s)]
*  Because of all the concessions that the Trump administration has given him, he's escalated. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=103.12s)]
*  For instance, he's added to the list of things he wants now, recognition from the United [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=108.28s)]
*  States and Ukraine of his annexation of Crimea. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=113.12s)]
*  So I wish it were different. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=116.88s)]
*  I wish the president and his team would try to put pressure on Putin, signaling, for instance, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  that they will actually impose sanctions rather than just talking about it, signaling that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=126.16s)]
*  they will escalate by giving the Ukrainians more weapons. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=131.24s)]
*  That would get Vladimir Putin's attention. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  But just talking tough and doing nothing does not get his attention. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=138.3s)]
*  Something that may have caught the Kremlin's attention is some social media postings from [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=143.32000000000002s)]
*  the German chancellor about providing different kinds of missiles to Ukraine. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=147.16s)]
*  So that's clearly something that could be new in the mix, even as we look at President [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=152.8s)]
*  Trump saying that Putin has, quote, gone absolutely crazy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=156.68s)]
*  I mean, that in and of itself is a remarkable statement, considering the president often [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  cites his relationship with Putin as a way that they could potentially work together. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  No working together has actually happened here, though. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=168.72s)]
*  So is this just another example of how he's miscalculating his influence and how Europe [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=171.28s)]
*  is kind of picking up the slack? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=175.96s)]
*  Well, first on President Trump, I applaud the fact that he tried to negotiate and he [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=177.88s)]
*  wants to end this horrific, barbaric war, that he even established diplomatic ties and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=185.72s)]
*  open channels of communications with the Russians. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=192.36s)]
*  That was good, too. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=194.64s)]
*  But his strategy of appeasement to Putin and pressure to Ukraine has not worked. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=196.12s)]
*  And if your strategy is not working, you've got to go to Plan B. And yes, I think he could [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=201.8s)]
*  learn from the Europeans. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=207.32s)]
*  I think increasing military assistance to Ukraine is a way to signal to Putin that time [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=208.52s)]
*  is not on his side. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=214.68s)]
*  Now, I'd like to see the Europeans do more, too. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=215.96s)]
*  For instance, they're sitting on $300 billion of Russian central bank assets. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=219.0s)]
*  They've been talking for years about seizing those assets and giving them to Ukraine. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  They should do that now. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=229.32s)]
*  That would show that they also are extending and expanding sanctions. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  But to the point that President Trump has been just giving concessions and not anything [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=236.68s)]
*  coercive, not any pressure on Russia, I think that strategy has to change. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  But then there's also the possibility, if we talk about that posture changing and Trump [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=249.0s)]
*  actually starting to match his words with actions, there is a bipartisan backed package [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=253.16s)]
*  sitting on Capitol Hill that would do massive sanctions on folks who would do business on [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=257.96s)]
*  oil and gas, other energy products with Russia. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=263.48s)]
*  Talk about what the impact would be inside the Kremlin if that package were to go into [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=266.68s)]
*  effect. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=270.68s)]
*  Well, it's a great package and it has bipartisan support. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=271.68s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=276.44s)]
*  All it needs is for President Trump to signal that he'll support it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=277.44s)]
*  And to the point about the Kremlin, of course, they'll say, why are you doing this? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  This is incompatible with what you said before. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=286.56s)]
*  But it's the way you get the attention of the Kremlin. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=289.32s)]
*  You have to put more sanctions on the Kremlin. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  Ambassador Michael McFaul, we always appreciate your expertise. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=298.64s)]
*  Thanks for coming on the program. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8jzQGMljA&t=301.12s)]
