# SEE: Jacob Soboroff fact checks Tom Homan saying he never threatened to arrest Newsom
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM)
*  Jacob, we mentioned you spoke with Governor Newsom last night, and he and the president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=0.0s)]
*  continue to exchange barbs on social media, I'm seeing this morning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=4.8s)]
*  What is his message in this moment, as we mentioned? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=9.08s)]
*  He's also threatened to sue the government. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=13.36s)]
*  Yeah, he sure has, Ana. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=15.44s)]
*  And we're watching for that lawsuit to be introduced into the court. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=17.6s)]
*  We expect that any minute this morning, he says essentially that contention in the lawsuit [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=21.84s)]
*  is that under this Title X of the U.S. Code, the way that they activated, as David was [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=26.16s)]
*  describing, the National Guard to come to the streets of Los Angeles without the permission [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=30.8s)]
*  of the governor, they didn't do it in consultation with the governor, which is part of the way [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=34.84s)]
*  the law is supposed to work, according to what Gavin Newsom told me last night. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  And then you mentioned those barbs continue between the White House and Governor Newsom [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=41.4s)]
*  directly. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Caroline Levitt and Governor Newsom are going back and forth right now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Governor Newsom responded to a tweet from Caroline Levitt by saying, Caroline, there [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  were no unsolved problems until Donald Trump created them. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=54.32s)]
*  Now the governor has to send in more law enforcement to clean up Trump's mess. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=56.96s)]
*  Trump can end this now, rescind the order and return the guard to the governor's command. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=60.96s)]
*  Trump created this mess. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=65.48s)]
*  We'll clean it up. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=67.2s)]
*  And that's what Governor Newsom has been saying all along here, is that the images that you're [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=68.2s)]
*  seeing on your screen right now are only such as they are because of the increased law enforcement [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=72.04s)]
*  presence from the National Guard. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=78.44s)]
*  And he is looking for the National Guard to return to his control. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=81.16s)]
*  Ana? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=84.6s)]
*  Is there any point in which he would say the National Guard actually is necessary? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=85.6s)]
*  And in fact, we need more people to come help this out. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=90.92s)]
*  The governor hasn't said that yet, but Jim McDonald, the police chief for the Los Angeles [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=95.0s)]
*  Police Department that is in charge of about 8000 to 9000 officers in the city of Los Angeles, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=98.52s)]
*  has said just about as much last night in a press briefing that because the situation [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=104.88s)]
*  is now sort of starting to grow and it is confined to that area, mostly in downtown [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=110.16s)]
*  Los Angeles, he is considering whether or not the National Guard would be helpful to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=114.64s)]
*  him in their efforts to do crowd control in the city of Los Angeles. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=120.06s)]
*  And Jacob, you also spoke with Border Czar Tom Homan, who's been on the ground there. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=124.92s)]
*  He's now pushing back on an answer he says was taken out of context when he said anyone [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=128.88s)]
*  who obstructs the immigration enforcement efforts there would be arrested, including [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=133.9s)]
*  Governor Newsom, including L.A. Mayor Karen Bass. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=138.66s)]
*  Listen to what he told Morning Joe. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=141.7s)]
*  We did a 20 minute interview and it cuts out a little clip that makes me and takes my words [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=145.34s)]
*  out of context. Here's what we said. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=150.94s)]
*  And he talked about what I talked about, these people that are on these protests and rioting [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=153.46s)]
*  when they cross the line, they got that voice that they have a right to protest. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=157.46s)]
*  Had the first amendment, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=160.7s)]
*  But they can't cross that line. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=162.01999999999998s)]
*  When he asked the questions that include Mayor Bass and Governor Newsom, I was clear [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=163.5s)]
*  they have a cross line. But they're not above the law either. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=168.46s)]
*  If they commit a crime, they certainly ask for prosecution. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=172.02s)]
*  That's what was happening. I never threatened or arrested Governor Newsom. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=174.98000000000002s)]
*  So I'm not biting off on that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=178.46s)]
*  Jacob, do you want to set the record straight? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=181.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, sure thing. Tom Homan said we cut a clip and took his words out of context. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=183.86s)]
*  We did anything but. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=187.9s)]
*  In fact, we presented the clips in their entirety in all of our hearings, including in our [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=189.78s)]
*  reporting on NBC News Dotcom. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=194.5s)]
*  He said that it was dishonest reporting. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=197.7s)]
*  Couldn't be further from the truth. It was completely honest. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=200.22s)]
*  I'll let our viewers watch both of those interviews, clips of them right now for themselves. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=202.33999999999997s)]
*  Here you go. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=206.66s)]
*  There have been threats, you know, previously that if you stand in the way of your [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  enforcement operations, you know, you could be subject potentially to arrest. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=213.94s)]
*  Are you saying that about Mayor Bass and Governor Newsom? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=217.62s)]
*  Are they at risk of being arrested? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=220.45999999999998s)]
*  I'll say it about anybody. You cross that line. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=221.66s)]
*  It's a felony to knowingly harbor and conceal and it'll go amly. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=224.45999999999998s)]
*  It's a felony to impede law enforcement from doing their job. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=227.46s)]
*  Do you do you think that the mayor of L.A. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  Is doing that? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=231.66000000000003s)]
*  If you cross that line, we'll ask the DOJ to prosecute. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=233.54000000000002s)]
*  Do I think she's crossing? I don't think she crossed the line yet. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  He did not rule out literally arresting you nor Mayor Bass if you interfere in his words. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=239.74s)]
*  He said you hadn't yet. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=246.14000000000001s)]
*  He's a tough guy. Why doesn't he do that? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=247.06s)]
*  He knows where to find me. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=248.46s)]
*  So right there in both of the interviews, you heard Tom Homan said, I don't think she's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=251.46s)]
*  crossed the line yet. And I said directly to Governor Newsom, he said you hadn't yet. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=255.66s)]
*  So it's right there on the tape. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=261.3s)]
*  I don't know what Tom Homan had seen, but we were very clear and given the full context [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=263.74s)]
*  of the statement that he did not believe that Governor Newsom had crossed a line yet, nor [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=268.21999999999997s)]
*  did Mayor Bass, but he reserved the right to arrest them if they did, which is what [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=272.5s)]
*  Governor Newsom responded to in the clip that Tom Homan saw. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=276.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gk2A8PEBM&t=279.78s)]
