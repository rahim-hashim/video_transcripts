# Trump pushes Putin, questioning if Russians are negotiating in good faith
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I)
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin says there will be a temporary ceasefire in the war in Ukraine next week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=0.0s)]
*  He wants it to coincide with the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=5.84s)]
*  Ukraine has responded, saying, make the ceasefire immediate. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=10.64s)]
*  It comes after President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met at the Vatican over the weekend. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=14.08s)]
*  You see them there on the screen before the funeral for Pope Francis. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=19.44s)]
*  It was their first face-to-face since that Oval Office clash back in February. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=23.2s)]
*  After that meeting, Trump, who has repeatedly said he believes Putin wants peace, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=27.36s)]
*  took to social media to criticize Russia's targeting of Ukrainian civilians. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=31.36s)]
*  Trump questioned whether Putin was serious about stopping the war or was just, quote, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=35.36s)]
*  tapping him along. Trump also addressed the situation after getting home from Europe. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=39.28s)]
*  I was very disappointed that missiles were flying by Russia, but that missiles were flying. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=46.0s)]
*  I wanted to stop shooting, sit down and sign a deal. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=52.0s)]
*  As for that deal, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Meet the Press that this week could prove pivotal. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=54.72s)]
*  I think this is going to be a very critical week. This week is going to be a really important week [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=63.04s)]
*  in which we have to make a determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=68.0s)]
*  continue to be involved in or if it's time to sort of focus on some other issues that are [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=72.0s)]
*  equally if not more important in some cases. But we want to see it happen. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  There are reasons to be optimistic, but there are reasons to be realistic, of course, as well. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=80.56s)]
*  We're close, but we're not close enough. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=85.04s)]
*  A ceasefire in Ukraine, but it is very notable that this announcement from the Kremlin coming [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=110.56s)]
*  shortly after Donald Trump stepped up criticism of Putin, saying he was disappointed that the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=116.0s)]
*  Russian leader continues to bombard Ukrainian cities and is questioning whether the Russians [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=121.68s)]
*  are negotiating in good faith to truly try to end this war. The president talking about potentially [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=127.92s)]
*  imposing new sanctions on Russia to force them back to the negotiating table. Now, this all came [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=134.08s)]
*  following a pretty dramatic meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky of Ukraine [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  at the Vatican over the weekends. They were both in Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=146.08s)]
*  the two leaders sitting knee to knee, just one on one. The first time that they have met in person [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  since that disastrous encounter in the Oval Office back in February. Now, President Trump emerging [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=158.8s)]
*  from that meeting stronger criticism of Russia that will be very welcome to the Ukrainians. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=165.12s)]
*  But there are still major, major gaps here between the different negotiating positions [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=170.88s)]
*  and slightly less welcome in Kiev. President Trump saying that he believes the Ukrainians are [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=176.32s)]
*  ready to recognize Russian control and sovereignty over Crimea. That is something that the Ukrainians [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=182.24s)]
*  have said is an absolute nonstarter. We are hearing today from the Russian foreign minister. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=189.44s)]
*  He is laying out a set of demands for ending the war that sound pretty similar to the demands that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=194.24s)]
*  Putin announced in February 2022 when he launched the full scale invasion. He's talking about what [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=199.12s)]
*  they call the denazification of Ukraine, recognition of Russian sovereignty over Eastern Ukraine, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=204.8s)]
*  and a commitment that Ukraine will not join NATO. So this is a very difficult path ahead for these [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  negotiations. And Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying this is going to be a critical week [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=218.56s)]
*  in determining whether these talks have any path forward. I'll send it back to you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=223.6s)]
*  Thanks to Raf for that. And joining me now is New York Times diplomatic correspondent Michael Crowley. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=228.72s)]
*  Michael, the Kremlin says Russia's ceasefire pitch for next week shows their goodwill, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=233.76s)]
*  but is there any indication Russia or Ukraine are ready to make a deal, especially when you see [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=238.56s)]
*  the optics of what happened before the Pope's funeral? President Trump and President Zelensky [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=243.68s)]
*  sitting face to face, knee to knee, actually looking for the first time, frankly, like allies. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=249.36s)]
*  Does that change the Russian calculus at all? I don't see it changing Russia's calculus. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  I think Vladimir Putin feels like he has a clear upper hand here. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  American support has kept Ukraine in this fight, has allowed Ukraine to survive for the last few [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=270.32s)]
*  years. And Donald Trump has made clear that he thinks that that support should either end entirely [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=277.2s)]
*  or be pared dramatically down. And I just think that Vladimir Putin feels like time is on his side, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=283.68s)]
*  given that reality, and that if he's going to make a deal now, it should give him close to everything [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=291.52s)]
*  he wants because if there's no deal, he can carry on the war with the expectation of dramatically [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=297.68s)]
*  reduced American support and realize his gains on the battlefield. So the big question here is, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=303.12s)]
*  with Donald Trump kind of facing the first real test he's had of his friendship with Vladimir Putin, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  the first sort of butting of heads they've had, is he willing to actually impose any kind of a [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  penalty on Putin, or will he just sort of say, I'm walking away from this whole thing, and also walk [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=320.64s)]
*  away from Ukraine and allow Russia to essentially run roughshod over Ukraine in the absence of any [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=325.04s)]
*  deal? Well, and you talk about the fact that Putin is benefiting from the time that he has right now. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=330.96s)]
*  Frankly, Trump has been giving him much of that leeway to play with, and it especially is apparent [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=336.56s)]
*  on issues like Crimea because you listen to Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister over the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=342.08s)]
*  weekend, and the way he talks about that issue, and it's perhaps a win because it's off the table [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=346.56s)]
*  in the negotiations. Listen. President Trump said Crimea is not even being discussed right now. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=351.52s)]
*  Yes, because this is a done deal. You mean Russia occupies and controls and will not negotiate [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  the future of Crimea? Is that what you're saying? Russia do not negotiate its own territory. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=366.56s)]
*  Now, we got to remember here, as I know you do, that Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=372.8s)]
*  The Ukrainians have said that they are not going to give this territory back, and yet you see [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  President Trump even just taking it off the table. So this is a clear sticking point, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=384.08s)]
*  even as we try to ramp things up this week to get some kind of a deal. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  Right, and Ukraine is just never going to accept this. Ukraine has the same position, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=393.76s)]
*  the one that is validated by international law, which is that it is their sovereign territory, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=398.47999999999996s)]
*  and it was seized by the Russians. What's dramatic about this is that from the time when it was first [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=403.28s)]
*  seized in 2014 by Russia and the Obama administration, and including in Trump's [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=410.0s)]
*  first administration, U.S. policy was that America would never recognize Russian control over Crimea, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=415.2s)]
*  that it was sovereign Ukrainian territory. In fact, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=422.0s)]
*  Trump's first term issued something called the Crimea Declaration, saying that the U.S. would [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=426.24s)]
*  never recognize Crimea nor change that policy as Russian, nor change that policy until it was back [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=431.36s)]
*  in Ukrainian hands. And Donald Trump, just in one fell swoop, has walked away from that and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=437.76s)]
*  made a concession with no clear exchange of concessions from the Russian side. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=444.32s)]
*  Michael, where do your sources think that this will go if we get to the end of this week and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  it's still clear that a ceasefire is not tangibly on the table? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=455.12s)]
*  I hear a lot of pessimism. You know, given Trump's track record, all the evidence suggests [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  that he is not going to pick a fight with Vladimir Putin. He does not like to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=467.2s)]
*  challenge or cross Putin. He likes to make him happy. And he has a long history of [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=471.76s)]
*  disparaging Ukraine, of fighting with Vladimir Zelensky. And all that prologue would suggest to [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=477.76s)]
*  you that rather than somehow escalate pressure on Russia using sanctions that he has vaguely [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=483.76s)]
*  threatened to do, that what he'll do is remove support from Ukraine and turn his attention [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=489.76s)]
*  elsewhere. And as I said earlier, that in effect gives Russia an enormous upper hand in this [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=495.6s)]
*  conflict. And Russia, you could expect to make dramatic military gains in the coming months. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=500.8s)]
*  And then, you know, at some point, does Ukraine cry uncle or is Ukraine potentially even defeated? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=506.48s)]
*  And we'll have to see what that looks like. Yeah, it's especially important as we consider [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  the ways that the American political landscape has changed in terms of the appetite, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=514.72s)]
*  or rather lack thereof, that exists on the Hill to continue providing military support [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=519.52s)]
*  and financial aid to Ukraine in this fight. Michael Crowley, thank you for coming on with us. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=524.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZPiBiwT97I&t=529.04s)]
