# 'It makes me feel angry': Workers forced out by Trump and Musk speak at MSNBC town hall
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8)
*  And I want to start by introducing some of the folks that are in the room tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's start with Brittany Coleman. Brittany was an attorney for the Office of Civil Rights [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=3.2s)]
*  at the Education Department. Then there's Carrie Murray, Murphy, excuse me, who worked at the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=7.2s)]
*  Commerce Department. Alyssa Elman is a disabled Army veteran who has let go from her job at the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=11.36s)]
*  Buffalo Veterans Affairs Office. Sam Peterson was a park guide for the National Park Service. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=17.04s)]
*  And Tamara May has spent 21 years in government service working her way up at the Centers for [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=22.32s)]
*  Disease Control and Prevention. And that is where we begin tonight, Tamara. Thank you so much for [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=26.72s)]
*  being here. Thank you for having me. Let's talk a little bit about the job that you have at the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=31.36s)]
*  CDC, that you had, I should say, at the CDC. You were working specifically on birth defects [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=35.76s)]
*  and developmental disabilities. How to support families who need extra help due to certain rare [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=39.76s)]
*  genetic conditions like sickle cell amnia. This was mandated by a bipartisan group in Congress. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Did you ever think that it would be abolished entirely? No, I never did. There are 71 million [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=52.16s)]
*  people in this country with a disability. So I truly believe that, I don't want to use the word [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=58.4s)]
*  safe, but I believe that, as you said, because it was a bipartisan group, that everyone understood [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=63.67999999999999s)]
*  the importance of the work we did. And we were one of the smallest centers at CDC. And so we [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=70.0s)]
*  focused very heavily on impact because we didn't have a large budget. So we focused on impact and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=76.56s)]
*  really meeting the needs of the audiences that we served. And an impact you made. I know it's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=83.2s)]
*  important to you as someone who suffered a debilitating injury from a natural gas explosion, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=88.4s)]
*  for people out there that are watching us tonight, to see people working for the federal government [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=93.2s)]
*  who have faced and live with disabilities. Is that right? Yes, absolutely. When my accident [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=97.92s)]
*  happened, it was devastating to me. I was in the hospital for a year. I fought really hard to go [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=103.12s)]
*  back to work because it was always important to me to serve the people of this country. And I [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  think that's one of the things that's really upsetting to me is because I truly believe most [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=115.68s)]
*  federal workers, all federal workers that I've ever known, are in it because we want to serve [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  this country. So I went back to work and every day was difficult for me from a health perspective. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  But I did it because of what we do. You know what? And it matters to the American people. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=132.16s)]
*  Thank you, Tamara. Thank you so much. Everybody give it up for Tamara. Thank you so much. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=136.96s)]
*  Thank you. Sam, stand up. Sam was a park guide at the National Park Service. Sam, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=142.0s)]
*  you were at the Roosevelt National Recreation Area in Oregon. You also were down at the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=148.48s)]
*  Jimmy Carter National Historic Park. You served during his funeral. Is that right? Yeah, it was [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=151.84s)]
*  an extreme honor for me. Before being in the Park Service, I had been a high school history teacher [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=155.92s)]
*  and like so many park rangers in the Park Service, just, you know, in love with the idea of America [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=160.56s)]
*  and our history and our treasures. So it was an honor for me. So from history teacher to park [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=166.24s)]
*  service employee, you don't want to quit on public service, do you? No, I truly believe that America [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=170.32s)]
*  is the best country on earth. And I believe the American people deserve to have a country that, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=175.6s)]
*  you know, supports them and that is available for them that they are deserve to be educated [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  or to see the amazing vistas at the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone. Which is why it's such a shame, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=187.28s)]
*  unfortunately, that you took a job outside the federal government, even though they offered for [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=192.0s)]
*  you to be reinstated. It was too late. You think you'll go back ever to the federal government? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=195.04s)]
*  Well, being a park ranger was my dream job. I sure would love to someday. I wasn't able to because of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=198.48s)]
*  our specific circumstances. I had to move six hours away. I was living in government housing [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=204.0s)]
*  when I got fired. So I had to move. You know, like I said, it's a dream job. So I'd love to go back. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=208.88s)]
*  Let's get you back in the federal government. Okay, Sam, thank you so much. Really [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=213.84s)]
*  appreciate you. Before you go, what do you think the park experience could be like for Americans [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=216.96s)]
*  this summer? This is what Americans and people from all over the world like to do for their summer [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  vacations. Yeah, so I would predict that Americans are going to see an impact at their parks. They [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  might not. And if they don't, it's not going to be sustainable. They might see overflowing, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=229.84s)]
*  overflowing trash cans and overflowing restrooms. Just today, actually, the America the Beautiful [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=235.28s)]
*  Act was introduced to Congress. So if they don't want to see impacts in their parks, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=239.68s)]
*  they should call their congressperson and they should support this legislation because it could [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=243.76s)]
*  go a long way to help their parks. Sam, thank you so much. Alyssa, let's hear from you. Thank you so [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  much for being here, Alyssa. You were working at the Buffalo Veterans Affairs Office in the Education [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  Department. And I want everybody to know, not only are you a cancer survivor, potentially because [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=257.28s)]
*  you were exposed to burn pits in Afghanistan, but you went into the VA, even though you probably [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=261.2s)]
*  could have made the same amount of money working, excuse me, accepting disability payments. Is that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=266.08s)]
*  correct? That is correct. And so tell me, why did you decide to go into the Federal Service and go [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=270.96s)]
*  to the VA? I decided to do it because I really care about veterans. I love to work. I didn't want to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=274.96s)]
*  feel like I was stagnant and staying home. I wanted to give back to a system that has given me so much. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=281.44s)]
*  Doctors at the VA treated my cancer, saved my life. Thank you, Dr. Ryan. But they were great for me. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  And I haven't had, you know, I've really benefited from these systems. And I wanted to be able to do [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=298.24s)]
*  something that was impactful, even if it was small, in order to give back to it. Let me tell you [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=303.68s)]
*  something. You're doing something impactful right now. And you're also doing something very brave, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=308.32s)]
*  because you were told you could have your job back. But if you spoke out to media, you couldn't. And [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=311.6s)]
*  here you are tonight speaking out in front of all of us. I want to say all of you are very brave, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=316.88s)]
*  but in particular, what you were faced with. Why did you decide to come and speak out tonight [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=320.56s)]
*  instead of take your job back? I feel like this is a critical time in our country. I love America. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=325.44s)]
*  I love being from this country. I've traveled the world. There is no greater system than what we [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=331.68s)]
*  have here. And I feel like it's just so very important to talk about not just myself, but my [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=337.04s)]
*  coworkers who work so hard to provide benefits, even when it's inconvenient, even when federal [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=342.48s)]
*  systems break. We work overtime. We exceed our production numbers on a regular basis. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=348.48s)]
*  And to characterize us as terrible people or people who are lining their pocket with federal [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=354.24s)]
*  dollars is a lie. How does that make you feel when you hear that? It makes me really angry. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  I feel terrible because I'm in a really unique position where I don't really need this job. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  But there are a lot of people who I work with who this is the money that they pay their mortgage [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=371.76s)]
*  with. This is the money that puts their children into sports. They're afraid to talk. They're [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  afraid to talk because they really want their jobs back. This is their primary source of income. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=381.12s)]
*  These people work really hard. The idea that we don't have any accountability for our job [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=386.16s)]
*  is a lie. We have to provide production numbers, numbers that we can't fake. They're looking at [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=394.08s)]
*  our computers for every single thing that we do during the day. And it's wrong to talk about [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=401.12s)]
*  employees who are working really hard for you and doing their best to provide these services [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=407.03999999999996s)]
*  in that way. The thing I've heard over and over again is that on their performance reviews, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=413.84s)]
*  these performance reviews ultimately were positive for all of these. How many of you [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  got a positive performance review just out of curiosity? There you go. Let's get the camera. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=423.52s)]
*  Well, keep your hands up, please. If you had a positive performance review, raise your hand. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=427.52s)]
*  Yeah. Thank you very much. I appreciate you talking to us. Thank you very much. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=431.12s)]
*  Carrie, I want to make sure to get you in here. You're an administrative officer [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=434.72s)]
*  for the CHIPS operation inside the Department of Commerce. Tell me what CHIPS is. CHIPS is [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=438.32000000000005s)]
*  bringing the manufacturing of semiconductors back into the United States. Wait, wait, wait, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=445.04s)]
*  wait, wait. Isn't that what President Trump said he wanted to do? That's why I thought [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  I was safe. That and the fact that they were saying, we're just going to get rid of waste, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=455.44000000000005s)]
*  fraud and abuse. And the mission that we were assigned to do was not that. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=460.64s)]
*  Then how do you feel when you watch the administration every day talk about, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  we're going to bring jobs back, we're going to bring manufacturing back, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=471.2s)]
*  when that's exactly what you were working on? That's exactly. And the colleagues I was working [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=475.12s)]
*  with, I mean, shout out to all of them. We were a very small group, but the most brilliant, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=480.08s)]
*  hardworking people. And that kind of piggybacks off of what Alyssa said. It's like we're getting [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  a wrap of, I ran into someone the other day, my neighbor, and she said, why didn't you just want [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=490.56s)]
*  to go back to work? And I said, what do you mean? And she said, well, aren't the people that are [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=495.84s)]
*  getting fired either poor performers or those that chose not to go back when we were mandated to go? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=500.08s)]
*  That's not what it looks like in this room tonight, is it? That's not the truth. Yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=505.6s)]
*  Carrie, it's all kind of dizzying too. So many of these people, how many of you have been [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=509.52s)]
*  fired, reinstated and fired again or some version of that? There you go. One more time [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=513.2s)]
*  for everybody. Hands up high, please. Fired, reinstated and then fired again. It's all very [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=517.36s)]
*  dizzying. How do you understand sort of the disorder of this process? You can't understand [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=521.36s)]
*  because every day you're wondering is today the day I lose my job? Is today the day I get my job [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=526.16s)]
*  back? Do I have insurance each day? That's a whole nother issue that we're running into now. So you [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=530.72s)]
*  can't. Yeah. There are so many stories just like insurance. It's one of them. And I thank you so [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=537.04s)]
*  much for sharing yours. Brittany, let's get you in here. Brittany, you're an attorney in the Office [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=540.9599999999999s)]
*  of Civil Rights in the Department of Education. You were doing compliance type work with [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=545.6s)]
*  anti-discrimination, disability laws, disenfranchised communities to make sure they have access to [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  available sources of financial assistance. Who's going to serve those families now? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, we've lost about 50% of our staff because of these cuts. So I can say for my office, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=559.52s)]
*  the Office for Civil Rights, we went from having 12 regional offices down to five. From 12 to five. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=567.2s)]
*  That's correct. And one of the things about your story that I found so compelling is that you said [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=573.28s)]
*  you were once in the shoes of the people you served. Absolutely. I mean, I was once a student [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=577.04s)]
*  in school who wanted to make sure that I had opportunities. I applied for federal student [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=582.0s)]
*  aid. I wanted to make sure that I was treated fairly and my parents did at times have to go [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=585.76s)]
*  to the school and advocate for me. This is what our office is for is that when people need to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=590.0s)]
*  advocate for their children, our students need to advocate for themselves, that they have an avenue [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=594.88s)]
*  and an advocate that will look into, well, a neutral party, I should say, who's an advocate [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=599.68s)]
*  for enforcing the laws of our nation and making sure that everyone is treated fairly. And that was [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=607.12s)]
*  you? That's correct. So right now, if folks were in your position as a student and they need help [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=612.0s)]
*  and they would want to reach out to your former office, what do they do? Who do they call? Well, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  my office, the Dallas office, is one of the seven offices that was closed. So unfortunately, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=623.3599999999999s)]
*  the workload has now been shifted to the Kansas City office. But you have to keep in mind that [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=628.0s)]
*  that staff is now dealing with what was already hard enough to deal with with 50 cases per person. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=632.4799999999999s)]
*  They're now dealing with 300 to 350 cases. 300 to 350 cases. That's correct. And so that type of [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=638.24s)]
*  work for workload, Brittany, is inconceivable, I would imagine, to people in your line of work. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=645.04s)]
*  It's unsustainable, but it's not just penalizing us. It's penalizing the students because they're [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=649.76s)]
*  having to wait for us to get to their cases for relief when they need it. Well, Brittany, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=654.0s)]
*  thank you very much for being here. And Steph, I have to say, not only an extraordinary group [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=658.56s)]
*  of people and not only very sad stories, but at the same time, such inspiring ones to have everybody [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=663.44s)]
*  be here tonight, be in the same room with us. There's something special going on here, you guys. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6yQmfmXV8&t=668.16s)]
