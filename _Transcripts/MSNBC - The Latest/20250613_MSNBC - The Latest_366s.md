# Israeli strikes on Iran looked beyond military facilities to target leaders
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40)
*  I want to bring into this conversation, and Ben, I hope you can stay where you are. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=0.0s)]
*  Courtney is sitting here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=3.92s)]
*  She can't go too far because we're at the same table. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=4.92s)]
*  Richard Engel, who's, of course, the chief Ford affairs correspondent. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=7.68s)]
*  Richard, Courtney is frantically typing on her phone right now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=11.6s)]
*  I know you were in touch with a lot of people. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=15.76s)]
*  What we didn't know at the top of the show a few minutes ago is what they exactly had [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=18.06s)]
*  hit. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=22.44s)]
*  Courtney gave us some updated reporting on that, how expansive this will be, if there [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=23.44s)]
*  are additional capabilities and capacities that were being used. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=27.24s)]
*  Who knew what when, I guess. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=31.459999999999997s)]
*  I know you've been doing a lot of reporting. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=33.04s)]
*  What do you know at this point? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=34.8s)]
*  Give us your sense of what's happening. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=36.68s)]
*  So sources in Tehran describe this as a very wide scale attack, that it wasn't just nuclear [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=40.08s)]
*  facilities that Iranian leaders were targeted, that residential compounds were hit, that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=45.56s)]
*  top officials in the IRGC, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, that top officials related to Iran's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=52.36s)]
*  nuclear program were targeted. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  So there was a decapitation element to this attack to try and eliminate the leaders of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=63.2s)]
*  Iranian leaders who were involved in the military or involved in the nuclear program. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  So attacks on sites, according to Prime Minister Netanyahu, dozens of Israeli aircraft were [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=76.16s)]
*  used to attack dozens of sites, including nuclear sites. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=81.84s)]
*  And according to these sources in Iran, not just nuclear sites, but also leadership sites, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=86.28s)]
*  residential compounds across the nation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=92.32s)]
*  One of the big questions here is, of course, what the retaliation may look like. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=96.25999999999999s)]
*  I don't know that they're going to predict that in advance, but you've been talking to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  sources there. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=103.8s)]
*  What should we anticipate? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  What could it look like? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  I just returned from Iran relatively recently. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=111.08s)]
*  I was there on two back-to-back trips, and the Iranians made it clear to me, both the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=114.44s)]
*  Iranian people and the Iranian government, that they wanted to avoid this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=119.88s)]
*  They were engaged in the peace talks with the Trump administration in the hopes of avoiding [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=123.36s)]
*  this exact scenario. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=129.84s)]
*  I spoke first talk on the popular level. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=131.44s)]
*  I spoke to many Iranians, young people, people who were out in businesses, in restaurants, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=133.16s)]
*  tech parks, and they told me many times they didn't want a confrontation with Israel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=139.44000000000003s)]
*  They didn't want a war with the United States. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=145.4s)]
*  They were hoping that the U.S. and Iran would reach an agreement that could see sanctions [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=147.88000000000002s)]
*  lifted, so Iranians could travel. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=152.4s)]
*  They were optimistic. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=155.12s)]
*  The currency in Iran was going up while I was there. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=156.28000000000003s)]
*  People were making plans about the future, hoping that they could make a deal with a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  more transactional President Trump, even though he had torn up the first nuclear agreement. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=165.44s)]
*  They thought, okay, maybe Trump was just looking for a better deal and that they could get [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=171.64s)]
*  a better deal and avoid this situation. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=175.56s)]
*  That's on a popular level and on a government level. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=178.88s)]
*  The government officials told me repeatedly they didn't want a conflict. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=181.24s)]
*  They wanted to reach a negotiated settlement. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=186.02s)]
*  I spoke to a top official in the Supreme Leader's office who laid out terms. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=189.04s)]
*  He said, this is what we expect. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=194.32s)]
*  This is what we're hoping for. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=197.6s)]
*  He said that they wanted to enrich a very low level of uranium or a low level of uranium. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=199.6s)]
*  They wanted to get rid of the highly enriched uranium that they already have. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=207.24s)]
*  This highly enriched uranium that apparently Israel now says was the reason why it targeted [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=211.8s)]
*  Iran at this moment. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=219.2s)]
*  Like I said, top Iranian officials told me they were willing to get rid of it and they [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  were working out those details in ongoing negotiations. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=226.16s)]
*  This is something that the Iranians didn't want and were hoping to avoid with these negotiations [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  that were, at least until a few hours ago, very much ongoing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=236.12s)]
*  You know better than almost anyone, Richard, that they have to save face in moments like [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=241.32s)]
*  this. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=247.84s)]
*  I was asking Ben Rhodes about this. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=248.84s)]
*  I asked Senator Adam Schiff about this even as they wanted to pursue a negotiation and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=250.08s)]
*  go back to a version of the deal that Trump ripped up years ago to get sanctions relief, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  as you said. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  Is that something they could do at this point given these strikes? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  Very likely that Iran will retaliate because the Iranian government was also somewhat divided [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  over this negotiated process. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=274.12s)]
*  There are hardliners in Iran who were stressing that this was a waste of time, that the U.S. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=275.84s)]
*  was just trying to fool Iran, was playing to sort of expose their weaknesses, that they [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=282.08s)]
*  would be duped in the end, that the Iranians shouldn't go down this path, and those hardliners [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  will be proven right. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=295.28s)]
*  Those who were pushing for negotiations are going to be in a very difficult position right [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=297.56s)]
*  now in Iran when they see what has just happened and what is apparently still going to be happening. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  It seems very likely that Iran will respond, if only because of the domestic politics that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=309.48s)]
*  it faces, because there are hardliners who said that this was the result that was coming, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  that this was something that Prime Minister Netanyahu was always going to do, and that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=321.32000000000005s)]
*  the negotiations were fig leaf cover for this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  I think it's very likely we're going to see some sort of military response. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=329.68s)]
*  The question is, does Iran have the capability to, especially now that it is under attack, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=333.68s)]
*  to do the kind of damage against Israel that would force it to stop an ongoing military assault? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_h5QpNa40&t=339.59999999999997s)]
