# 'Bizzaro FDR': Republicans do nothing in face of Trump chaos in first 100 days
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4)
*  You're approaching the culmination, the first 100 days of the Trump presidency. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=0.0s)]
*  You're not allowed to describe it in one word as chaotic. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=6.32s)]
*  But how would you sum up this period of time? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=9.64s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't have said chaotic because I think the story of this 100 days has been [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=11.64s)]
*  sort of Vizarro FDR situation where instead of Congress doing bold persistent experimentation [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=16.72s)]
*  and league with the president, Congress, Republicans in Congress, which should be specific, handed [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  their power over to the president and have let him run on everything. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=25.32s)]
*  You've seen the story of the Republican Party in this period has been them waiting to see [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=28.2s)]
*  what Trump does and then endorsing it, which changes the way things are covered. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=32.72s)]
*  We cover conflict. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=36.88s)]
*  We cover, in the first term, if Bob Corker said something, we covered it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=37.88s)]
*  And he had resistance. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=41.92s)]
*  I think the story has been all his experimentation being approved by one of our political parties [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=42.92s)]
*  with no real resistance. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=47.8s)]
*  You've been talking about the effects of this. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=48.8s)]
*  The party has signed on for stuff that has not worked in a lot of cases. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=50.8s)]
*  But that transformation of the entire party endorsing this imperial presidency, that's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=54.72s)]
*  what's been every week shaping the changes to the country, I think. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=59.64s)]
*  I think it's closing on a very strong down note for Donald Trump. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=64.48s)]
*  Like a wah wah. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=68.52s)]
*  Very decidedly. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=71.88s)]
*  And it may mark a momentum shift that is going to continue. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=72.88s)]
*  He started with shock and awe. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  He was doing, as David said, a million things. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=79.2s)]
*  Congress was stepping back. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=81.6s)]
*  And now we see the markets have turned down, which gives a measurable thing that people [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=84.36s)]
*  can look at. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=90.56s)]
*  Everyone knows that it's Donald Trump himself who is doing this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=92.4s)]
*  It's not conditions in the economy, because he was handed a good economy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=96.0s)]
*  And I think the fact that he's done that and been forced to back off, and people have seen [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=100.0s)]
*  that, raises doubt about whether he knows what he's doing on a whole range of other [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=104.88s)]
*  fronts. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=109.52s)]
*  And he doesn't. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=110.52s)]
*  The Doge thing has not been successful. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=112.36s)]
*  They have not found waste and fraud. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=114.44s)]
*  They have found programs that— [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=117.27999999999999s)]
*  They don't like. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  —Elon Musk and Donald Trump don't like. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  The deportation regime has gotten increasingly secret police-like in terms of grabbing people [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  without proof that they've done anything especially wrong, other than— [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  And even their numbers aren't what they wanted them to be. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  The numbers aren't what they wanted them to be. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=139.76s)]
*  And they're not getting dangerous criminals out, which is why they're having to make [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=141.2s)]
*  claims about people who don't have criminal records or people who write an op-ed at the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=144.92s)]
*  college newspaper that they don't like. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=150.96s)]
*  So I think—and the Ukraine war has not been solved, as he said it would. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=153.76s)]
*  Israel as well. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=160.12s)]
*  Israel as well. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=161.12s)]
*  So I think people can see that this is a guy who is flailing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=162.12s)]
*  And you see that in the numbers. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=166.96s)]
*  He was at or near 50 when he started. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=170.08s)]
*  He's around low 40s now, maybe 40 in one of the—I think Reuters had him at 37 yesterday. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=172.76s)]
*  So I think he's been badly weakened politically. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=180.56s)]
*  He's got a Pentagon in total disarray and a defense secretary who's clearly in over [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=184.0s)]
*  his head. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=189.68s)]
*  I think this is a difficult moment for Trump and a time that people have begun, Democrats [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=191.24s)]
*  and outside institutions, Harvard leading the way, have begun to stand up and push back, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=197.2s)]
*  and they've done it pretty effectively. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=202.36s)]
*  I want to get your first hundred days, but before—I want you to think about this, Jason, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=203.68s)]
*  and I want to sort of mentally push back on John's idea, because we're all kind of sitting [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=208.48s)]
*  here nodding our heads. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=212.44s)]
*  But if people—if the majority of Americans actually said, you're right, you're right, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=214.64s)]
*  you're right, you're right, we would see more Republicans other than just Don Bacon [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=218.96s)]
*  pushing back, right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=223.72s)]
*  They've got midterms not that far away, and it goes back to your original point. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=224.76s)]
*  Republicans are basically acquiescing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=229.0s)]
*  We're watching chaotic decision or things not work out, not work out, not work out, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=230.4s)]
*  and they're saying, thank you, sir, we'll have another. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=235.48s)]
*  So do we really think there's going to be a momentum shift? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=237.4s)]
*  Because if there was, they'd be worried about their own hinds. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=241.0s)]
*  No, because there's a lot of people who like this stuff. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=243.32s)]
*  There's a lot of people who like this stuff. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=245.8s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=247.64s)]
*  Here's my first 100 years. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=248.64s)]
*  We tried to tell you, right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=250.38s)]
*  Whether it's Hillary Clinton or Kamala Harris, people told the American public, this is what [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=251.8s)]
*  he's going to do. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=256.72s)]
*  It was in Project 2025. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=257.72s)]
*  This was not crazy TikTok conspiracy theory. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  They said they were going to dismantle the administrative state, and that's what they're [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=261.68s)]
*  doing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=265.56s)]
*  Now, all the heck and nonsense that you have with Doge, all the things that you have going [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=266.56s)]
*  on with immigration, these were all things that he said. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=270.04s)]
*  The issue that I see is not with the Republicans, because I don't think they've been a functional [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=273.14s)]
*  party ever since Donald Trump walked down the elevator, right? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=276.76s)]
*  I don't think they've operated as anything other than the Royal Stamp. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=279.32s)]
*  What's been concerning to me is the lack of plan by Democrats over and over again in the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=282.12s)]
*  face of something that they knew was coming eight months ago. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=286.96s)]
*  We are now almost 100 days into this, and they still don't have a counter message. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=289.96s)]
*  The bravest thing they did was Cory Booker standing for 25 hours, which was simple and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=293.68s)]
*  realistic because regular people could understand it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=297.92s)]
*  Yes, but it didn't offer anything else. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  And one of the reasons Donald Trump's base gives him space is because they, like a lot [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=302.62s)]
*  of people say, the country's not working for me, and they're giving him time because [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=308.02s)]
*  they're saying his plan might not work, but at least there's a plan. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=311.5s)]
*  And Cory Booker did stand up, but they've yet to say, well, here's what we're going [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  to offer. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=317.85999999999996s)]
*  Well, that's what I'm saying. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=318.85999999999996s)]
*  That's the only thing, because it was least understandable. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=319.85999999999996s)]
*  I don't care who you are. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=321.58s)]
*  Most people don't understand. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=322.58s)]
*  I wouldn't stand in the line for 25 hours to get a Star Wars movie, right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=323.58s)]
*  When people understood it, it was like, okay, this is what you're like. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=326.78s)]
*  I definitely wouldn't do that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=328.78s)]
*  Even I wouldn't, right? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  And I'm into that stuff. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=331.21999999999997s)]
*  But the Democrats as a whole, they don't have a message. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=332.5s)]
*  Hey, Cain Jeffries doesn't have a message. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=334.18s)]
*  Chuck Schumer doesn't have a message. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=335.65999999999997s)]
*  I knew this from the Republican Party. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=338.02s)]
*  I knew this is the kind of stuff they were going to do. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=339.58s)]
*  What I'm shocked by is that the only people who seem to be talking are Bernie and AOC [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=342.02s)]
*  running around the country. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=346.18s)]
*  And trust me, I went to their rally in Los Angeles. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=347.18s)]
*  They're still making the same mistakes they always did, which is a crowd in downtown Los [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=349.53999999999996s)]
*  Angeles that still doesn't look any more diverse than downtown Wisconsin. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=352.88s)]
*  That's the issue. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=356.85999999999996s)]
*  So the first 100 days, Democrats still failing, Republicans doing what I expect. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=357.85999999999996s)]
*  Okay, but then I'm the naive turkey because I will say Donald Trump has been talking about [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=360.74s)]
*  tariffs for 40 years. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=365.21999999999997s)]
*  He loves them. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=367.02s)]
*  He wants to implement them. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=368.02s)]
*  But I, like many other people, didn't actually think he was going to do it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=369.02s)]
*  If he had just taken Joe Biden's economy, did the tax cuts, deregulated so businesses [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=373.21999999999997s)]
*  would basically be able to do whatever they wanted, he would be smooth sailing because [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=380.46s)]
*  he could even take Joe Biden's economy and oversell it, which is what he does. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=385.29999999999995s)]
*  And he could roll down tomorrow, lago, flog his meme coin, dance with True Social and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=389.58s)]
*  play golf every weekend. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  So for a lot of people, me included, I'm embarrassed to say I'm surprised he went with the tariff [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=396.5s)]
*  war first. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=401.06s)]
*  Well, I'm surprised. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=402.06s)]
*  It's much more on every front than I expected. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=403.06s)]
*  I knew it was going to be bad. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=405.9s)]
*  It's much worse. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=407.46s)]
*  But I think, you know, if he was a run of the mill con man who had had I got to say [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=409.34s)]
*  if he was a run of the mill politician, he was a run of the mill con man. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=415.5s)]
*  Oh, I'm so sorry. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=419.26s)]
*  If he was a run of the mill con man, he would recognize at what point he could make the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=420.26s)]
*  con work by taking the Biden economy and calling it his own, which it isn't. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=427.14s)]
*  But he's there's something wrong with him. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=432.3s)]
*  He is I don't know what you call it, malignant narcissist, sociopath. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=435.7s)]
*  People apply different names to what Donald Trump what his mental condition is, but he [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=441.98s)]
*  can't do that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=447.02s)]
*  He can't constrain himself in that way. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=448.18s)]
*  And he doesn't have people around him who are inclined to constrain him or able to constrain [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=452.1s)]
*  him. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=458.1s)]
*  He had some of that in the first term that helped him, but he doesn't have it now and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=459.1s)]
*  he's not controlling himself. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=463.1s)]
*  This is exactly what I heard from a very big investor today who voted for Donald Trump, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=464.14s)]
*  who said one of the main issues is he really truly has made loyalty to him his number one [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=468.74s)]
*  priority. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=474.98s)]
*  Howard Lutnick said it when they were during the transition. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=476.98s)]
*  And unlike the first term where you had a Gary Cohn or Jared Kushner or Steve Mnuchin, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=480.1s)]
*  there's no one to push back on him. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=484.58000000000004s)]
*  And Wall Street doesn't like it, but Trump loves it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=486.54s)]
*  So for Wall Street or for the business community, they're in that, you know, if you choose clowns, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=490.38s)]
*  you get a circus. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=494.66s)]
*  The issue is the outsiders don't like it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=495.74s)]
*  But Trump is going, I'm down with Pete Hegseth every day. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=498.18s)]
*  He's just telling me how great I am and how good my hair looks. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=501.06s)]
*  More with immigration, because you were talking about if he just kept Biden's economy in place, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=503.62s)]
*  he wasn't going to keep Biden's deportation system in place. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=508.02s)]
*  But what did he add to it? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=510.18s)]
*  The deportations that they have added on top of this, or taking visas away from college [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=512.34s)]
*  students, the Garcia mess in El Salvador, this is something I would add. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=516.42s)]
*  I'd add Chris Van Hollen to the list Democrats have done something in the last week. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=521.02s)]
*  That's the one surprise the last 100 days is that Democrats really were on their back [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=524.0600000000001s)]
*  foot about immigration, did not know how to talk about it, were terrified that it was [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=527.38s)]
*  Trump's secret sauce and it was going and they're going to lose everything. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=531.26s)]
*  And he has been so hubristic listening to Stephen Miller to speak of that, there are people [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=533.74s)]
*  who have an open door with him that you've started to see a backlash on his best issue, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=537.82s)]
*  which wouldn't have been there if they were just deporting. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=542.14s)]
*  Here's a high profile criminal. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=544.1800000000001s)]
*  Look at this terrible story of somebody who committed a crime. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=545.38s)]
*  Look at this drunk driver. Look at this accused murder. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=547.62s)]
*  They're not doing that. They're going further with a vision of just shrinking the foreign [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=550.02s)]
*  non-citizen population of the country. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=553.98s)]
*  And they've done it in a way that has allowed Democrats to come back on a way a week ago, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=555.82s)]
*  even if you ask Democrats about El Salvador. They were much more divided. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=560.74s)]
*  They arrested a judge today who sent a defendant out a door that was in a non-public area and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=562.9s)]
*  they went in and arrested the judge. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=570.86s)]
*  I think that's something that's probably satisfying to Trump, satisfying to Tom Homan. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=573.2199999999999s)]
*  I would be very surprised if that goes over well in the current environment. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=578.02s)]
*  Okay, this is why this is super interesting to me because a week ago when we got started [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=581.9399999999999s)]
*  the Maryland man in the prison in El Salvador, suddenly all these Wall Street guys were talking [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=586.9s)]
*  about the story to me and I'm like, what do they care? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=592.18s)]
*  None of these people are immigration activists. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=594.02s)]
*  But what they truly care about is the rule of law because nobody wants to invest money [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=596.66s)]
*  and do business in a place that's being run mobster style. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=601.86s)]
*  It's why nobody does business in Russia. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=605.62s)]
*  And so suddenly this issue, even if Trump just rolled up super tough on the border, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=607.38s)]
*  which Joe Biden didn't, that would have been a win for him. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=612.18s)]
*  Arbitrary expansions of power don't make people comfortable, right? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=615.14s)]
*  If I don't know what you're going to do week in and week out, I'm not happy with it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=618.9s)]
*  Even people who are hostile and don't like people who are undocumented, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=622.34s)]
*  you don't like brown people, whatever, you don't like folks getting yanked off the street. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=625.46s)]
*  You don't like folks being told- [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=629.14s)]
*  By people with masks on and no uniforms. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=630.66s)]
*  And then, and I can tell you this because this is where it gets into the lower level, right? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=632.9s)]
*  The TikTok world, the world of young people and under 30 who don't watch any of this and [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=636.58s)]
*  don't pay attention, you know what they're saying about immigration? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=641.06s)]
*  They're saying farmers say, I don't have workers here anymore. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=643.54s)]
*  They're seeing college kids saying, oh my gosh, my roommate is afraid to write an op-ed, blah, blah, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=646.02s)]
*  blah. They're picking this up as this is not getting rid of criminals. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=650.5s)]
*  This is getting rid of my friends. This is getting rid of my neighbors. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=653.6999999999999s)]
*  My pastor is talking about this. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=656.26s)]
*  And we're seeing it in Trump's poll numbers with young men who he crushed it with. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=657.6999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. When Joe Rogan is saying, hey, that's a bad idea. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=660.9s)]
*  Great. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=663.6999999999999s)]
*  Okay. And I always say this. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=664.18s)]
*  That was the top. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=665.4599999999999s)]
*  Let's not be crazy. He didn't lose Joe Rogan. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=665.9399999999999s)]
*  Rogan is still going to vote for him. But when people start criticizing the president, him and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=667.6999999999999s)]
*  the guys who won Barstool sports, he's lost those people because even they think this is crazy. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=672.1s)]
*  At some point, you're going to see a baseball player get snatched off the field in the middle [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=676.82s)]
*  of the game. And then a lot of people are going to say, oh my gosh, this is a problem. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLb5rtkY4c4&t=679.22s)]
