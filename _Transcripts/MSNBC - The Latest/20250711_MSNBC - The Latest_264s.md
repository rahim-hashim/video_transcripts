# Oh Canada! Trump threatens Canadian imports with 35% tariff, citing fentanyl crisis
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU)
*  Back with us NBC News White House correspondent Monica Alba and joining us now CNBC senior analyst Ron Insana [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=0.0s)]
*  So Monica you were there. We heard the president say tariffs are gonna work out [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=6.4s)]
*  All as the president reignites his trade war with Canada overnight. Can you walk us through this latest threat? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=10.8s)]
*  Yeah, and again, I think we've seen this kind of escalation [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=16.8s)]
*  Especially with such a key trading partner over and over in the last six months and just recently a few weeks ago [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=19.36s)]
*  There was going to be a digital services tax that Canada had announced only for Canada to essentially [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=25.959999999999997s)]
*  Eventually after some talks walk it back to appease the president it seemed to see if there could be other negotiations [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=33.08s)]
*  So this may be just the beginning of another round of these talks where ultimately this isn't [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=39.44s)]
*  What is going to be put in place is 35% on goods again if another deal isn't struck by August 1st [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=45.0s)]
*  But this is also a situation where as you mentioned and as we briefly touched on Alex [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=51.76s)]
*  The president is making false claims about the amount of fentanyl that's flowing from the northern border [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=56.12s)]
*  Into the United States his own data shows that it's really a very very small amount of fentanyl compared to other sources of that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=60.92s)]
*  Very deadly drug that comes into the United States [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=68.48s)]
*  We've seen some kind of politically motivated moves when it comes to trade [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  There was also of course the announcement on Brazil that related to the treatment of former leader Jair Bolsonaro [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=74.8s)]
*  Which is something the president also touched on on the South Laundress there saying that he believes he's been treated unfairly [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=81.16s)]
*  And that's part of the reason that he's doing another trade [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=86.44s)]
*  War move with Brazil that again could ultimately be negotiated before August 1st Alex [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=90.56s)]
*  Yeah, those fentanyl numbers 22,000 pounds have crossed the American border of which 43 came in from Canada [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=96.46s)]
*  So that's important to keep in mind so Rana Ron [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=102.88s)]
*  Canada having rescinded as Monica mentioned the digital services tax to appease Trump that happened in June [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  What do you make of the president's latest demands and how it could impact Americans wallets? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=111.64s)]
*  Well, we think at this point that the average American can pay [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  $2,400 more per year if the tariffs stay in place as they are currently constructed the average tariff right now [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=121.32s)]
*  Alex is about 15 to 16 percent [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  That is the highest tariff level being imposed on other countries by the United States since [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=130.64s)]
*  1936 and that doesn't include, you know [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=136.28s)]
*  Some of the other larger tariffs that we've seen levied against countries including now this addition on both Brazil and Canada [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=138.48s)]
*  So this will have an impact on the economy. It hasn't bled through to inflation yet [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=145.85999999999999s)]
*  But again, it does seem that some businesses are still working off inventories. They brought into the country pre-tariff now [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=149.76s)]
*  We're starting to see however some auto dealers and others talk about the possibility of prices going up in the fall as a result [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=156.44s)]
*  Of these tariff imposition. So Americans will eventually feel it [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=162.96s)]
*  They're feeling it in some places already and so it will have an economic impact irrespective [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  What the president says about how the economy is doing right now [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=170.4s)]
*  Let me ask you Ron. What do you think it would take to have the president change his strategy? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean he keeps sending these letters then he delays deadlines for his tariffs and he's not seeing much progress [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=178.12s)]
*  No, not I mean, you know 90 deals were promised in 90 days and we really have two framework agreements and then one [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=184.16s)]
*  Tariff pause with China so we have not seen a lot of progress being made on this front [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=190.16s)]
*  You know and the first casualty of war Alex as you know is the truth and that is probably true in trade wars as well [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  And so we're not getting a lot of clarity [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=202.08s)]
*  We never have really gotten a lot of clarity around the rationale for tariffs [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=204.44s)]
*  Is it to raise money to reduce the deficit? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=208.24s)]
*  Is it to level the playing field with respect to trade? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=211.24s)]
*  Are there other reasons why the president is wedded to tariffs? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=215.24s)]
*  He often talks about the period from 1870 to 1913 when there was no income tax and there was just tariffs [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=218.84s)]
*  That's what the US government brought in revenue. So the end game remains unclear [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=224.44s)]
*  Wall Street continues to shrug it off because it appears they believe the president will ultimately back away [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  But even if he backs away, we're going to end up with 10% baseline tariffs [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=234.44s)]
*  Which is still almost five times higher than the tariffs that were in place during the last administration [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU5XKfQ0FkU&t=238.24s)]
