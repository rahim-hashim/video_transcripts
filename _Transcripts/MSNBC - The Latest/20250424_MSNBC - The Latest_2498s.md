Video Description: The Trump administration is waging war on academia — from the institutions themselves to the students who attend them. Prestigious universities such as Columbia, Harvard and more, are navigating threats from the administration to cut funding — or actual cuts to funding, in Harvard's case — if they don't comply with demands related to Trump's political agenda. Then there are the high-profile detentions of foreign students driving anxiety on college campuses. On this episode of “Can They Do That” MSNBC Legal Correspondent Lisa Rubin dives deep into the legal details of Trump's attacks on academia with Columbia University Law Professor and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice, Jamal Greene. Hear why Greene says "there's no question" the country is in a constitutional crisis and what he thinks about the administration's attacks on colleges around the country. 
 
Editor’s note: This episode was taped before Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration. The university sued after the federal government said it was freezing $2.2 billion in grants and sought what university officials described as "unprecedented and improper" control over the Ivy League institution.

# 'Students are very afraid': Is Trump’s college crackdown legal?
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo)
*  Where it comes to the Trump administration, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=0.0s)]
*  everywhere I go, people ask me, can they do that? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2.3000000000000003s)]
*  I'm MSNBC legal correspondent, Lisa Rubin. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  And today, I'll be examining the assault [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=8.88s)]
*  on two pillars of American civil society, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=11.18s)]
*  higher education, and law firms, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  with Columbia University law professor, Jamal Green. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=15.92s)]
*  Welcome to the show, Jamal. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=19.26s)]
*  Thank you. Good to be here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=20.46s)]
*  I'm glad to have you here. I should say in full disclosure, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=21.46s)]
*  you and I know one another. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=23.56s)]
*  You have accomplished quite a bit [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=25.36s)]
*  since we have known one another as law students [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=27.060000000000002s)]
*  and I just want, for our viewers' sake, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=28.96s)]
*  to give them a sense of your background [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=30.52s)]
*  to set the stage for the conversation [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=32.4s)]
*  we're about to have. Is that okay? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=33.8s)]
*  Great. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=35.06s)]
*  Okay. You are a constitutional law professor [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  who not only teaches con law, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=38.04s)]
*  but also you teach comparative constitutional law, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=40.74s)]
*  which I imagine is the study of constitutional law [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=43.94s)]
*  across different countries. Yes? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=46.58s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=48.34s)]
*  Okay. The law of the political process, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=49.44s)]
*  which you're going to have to explain to me. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=50.64s)]
*  First Amendment law and federal courts, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=52.08s)]
*  which for viewers who don't know, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=54.08s)]
*  is the sort of study of the power... [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=55.78s)]
*  The power of federal courts and also practice [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=58.339999999999996s)]
*  within federal courts. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=60.28s)]
*  You specialize in the structure of legal argument [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  and language. Is that right? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=65.16s)]
*  That's fair, yeah. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=66.96s)]
*  Okay. And you are also someone who has [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=68.06s)]
*  firsthand experience at the Justice Department, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=72.0s)]
*  which I think is a really important predicate [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  for this conversation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=75.46s)]
*  You served as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=76.94s)]
*  in the Office of Legal Counsel, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  which is the Office of Justice [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=81.2s)]
*  that tells the administration what it can do [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=83.58s)]
*  and what it can't. It's basically like [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=85.9s)]
*  an in-house mother-may-I of the executive branch. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=87.25999999999999s)]
*  And you were there between January of 2023 [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=90.96s)]
*  and December of 2024, so almost two years. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  Did I get that all right? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=98.44s)]
*  That's... [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  I'm channeling my interracial matter right now. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=100.64s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=101.94s)]
*  Okay. We're going to do a lightning round [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  of sorts at the end, but I want to throw you [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=104.84s)]
*  one of those questions now so I can be like [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  the annoying kid in the back of the car ride [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  who says, are we there yet? Right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=110.66s)]
*  Like, you've experienced that car ride [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=112.78s)]
*  with your kids, I imagine? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=114.06s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=115.06s)]
*  I was going to... for a second, I was like, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=116.14s)]
*  oh, God, maybe his kids are less annoying than mine. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  How do you define an American constitutional crisis? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=121.12s)]
*  I think of a constitutional crisis as a moment [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=124.66s)]
*  where there is some kind of paralysis [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=128.36s)]
*  or possibly abuse of the Constitution [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=132.1s)]
*  that has no obvious solution. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=136.04s)]
*  And I think there's no question that we're there. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=138.2s)]
*  I think we actually got there from the moment [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=141.88s)]
*  we had an executive branch that wasn't really [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=144.96s)]
*  paying much attention to internal legal constraint. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, as someone who worked [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=150.04s)]
*  in the Office of Legal Counsel, which is what [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=151.78s)]
*  that office does is really, you know, mother may I, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=153.84s)]
*  you know, that's I think a fair description, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=156.62s)]
*  spent a lot of time in the Biden administration [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=161.38s)]
*  saying what you can and can't do. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=164.76s)]
*  And so much of what the executive branch does [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=166.82s)]
*  is something that will never get to a court, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=169.92s)]
*  but that it has to constrain itself about. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  So if you had to pinpoint the moment at which [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=174.9s)]
*  we were at a constitutional crisis, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=177.34s)]
*  because as you define it, it's not necessarily [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=179.14s)]
*  something that happens in a court in public view, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=181.54s)]
*  when was that moment precisely [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  when it comes to this administration? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=187.48s)]
*  You know, when after January 20th did that happen? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=189.62s)]
*  So, you know, for me, I had this thought [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=192.32s)]
*  for the first time on January 20th [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=194.62s)]
*  when I saw the Birthright Citizenship Executive Order, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=197.22s)]
*  which is flagrantly unconstitutional, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=200.26s)]
*  and that even though it doesn't have any real legal defense, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=202.82000000000002s)]
*  but is put out there as if, you know, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=205.82000000000002s)]
*  we'll see what the courts do. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=207.86s)]
*  You know, that kind of behavior where you say, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=209.26000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to do it unless and until someone tells me not to. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=211.5s)]
*  And that someone is a court that's going to act slowly, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=215.10000000000002s)]
*  it's going to act, it may not act for, you know, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=217.8s)]
*  a really long time, shows me that you've got [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=221.0s)]
*  a basically unconstrained executive branch, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=223.94s)]
*  and that's incredibly dangerous. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  So that was the moment of deep danger, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=228.18s)]
*  where the institution to step in at that point [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=230.28s)]
*  is the executive branch itself, which is being purged, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=233.08s)]
*  or members of Congress, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=236.54s)]
*  who in Congress has been entirely inert. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=238.62s)]
*  So, if we're thinking about this, I'm thinking about, like, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=241.68s)]
*  a spectrum where you go from green to red, right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=243.78s)]
*  If we're already in the red without being hyperbolic, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=246.46s)]
*  how much further in the red are we today [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=250.56s)]
*  than we were on January 20th? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=253.06s)]
*  I think quite a bit further, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=254.36s)]
*  where maybe if it's like flashing red, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=256.64s)]
*  or sirens going off at this point, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=259.08s)]
*  and at some point people stop paying attention [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=262.12s)]
*  because, you know, there's so much lawlessness happening. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=264.02s)]
*  But at one point, I think the president [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=267.0s)]
*  and the Department of Homeland Security [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=270.6s)]
*  have been not complying with a district court order, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=272.9s)]
*  with multiple federal district court orders. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=276.6s)]
*  Now the Supreme Court has weighed in [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=279.68s)]
*  in this case involving this Maryland man [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=281.58s)]
*  who's been sent wrongly to El Salvador. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=284.24s)]
*  And you've got an administration that is at least flirting [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=287.0s)]
*  with ignoring the Supreme Court itself. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=292.98s)]
*  Under the guise of an interpretive dispute [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=295.38s)]
*  about the meaning of the word facilitate. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=298.42s)]
*  That's the guise, but this is really unprecedented territory. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=300.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just surprised to hear you define it that way. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  And I think it's a really interesting definition [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=307.42s)]
*  because we've got people on this network, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=309.42s)]
*  and people who come on who are also legal academics, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=311.36s)]
*  who will say the moment of constitutional crisis [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=313.8s)]
*  is what you identified second. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=315.85999999999996s)]
*  The moment where the administration disobeys flagrantly [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=317.41999999999996s)]
*  an actual court order or Supreme Court opinion. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=320.85999999999996s)]
*  And you're saying, no, actually it came much before that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=324.94s)]
*  If you can't constrain yourself from violating [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=327.44s)]
*  the Constitution or statutes flagrantly and frequently, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=330.64s)]
*  then you're already in a place [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=334.73999999999995s)]
*  where the constitutional crisis has occurred. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=336.94s)]
*  That's right. We have a very long tradition, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=338.62s)]
*  and I think it's not that well understood, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  but a very long tradition of the executive branch [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=342.17999999999995s)]
*  actually constraining itself across administrations, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=344.24s)]
*  including people who are career employees [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=346.68s)]
*  inside the executive branch, inside particular agencies. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=348.78000000000003s)]
*  And the very first moves of this administration [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=352.38000000000005s)]
*  was to try to get rid of as many of those people as possible. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=355.06s)]
*  And that's a pretty good sign [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=357.86s)]
*  that they're not trying to constrain themselves. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=359.66s)]
*  I'm not saying they're unconstrained. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=361.66s)]
*  There are political constraints on the president's behavior. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=363.46000000000004s)]
*  There are things they want to do [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=366.16s)]
*  and things they don't want to do. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  They can't just do whatever they want. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=369.04s)]
*  But there is so much that the executive branch does [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=372.02s)]
*  that will never, ever see a courtroom. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=374.56s)]
*  Or if it does see a courtroom, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=376.76s)]
*  the way in which the court is able to intervene [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=378.4s)]
*  is very, very narrow. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=380.9s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing right now [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=382.4s)]
*  with the Supreme Court. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=383.6s)]
*  They're kind of playing with what the court has told them, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=384.8s)]
*  knowing that they hold a lot of the cards. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=387.6s)]
*  The court doesn't have an army. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=389.84s)]
*  It can't march into El Salvador, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=391.74s)]
*  and they're taking advantage of that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=393.74s)]
*  I want to bring you back at another point [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=395.24s)]
*  while we're doing this series to talk about OLC [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=396.88s)]
*  and how the Supreme Court is doing [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=399.18s)]
*  and how much of the way in which the executive branch [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=401.02000000000004s)]
*  and specifically the White House is constrained [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  is sort of colored by the conversations [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=406.76s)]
*  or the go-between between OLC and the White House. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=410.20000000000005s)]
*  But while we're here today, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=413.3s)]
*  the focus is going to be universities and law firms, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=415.14000000000004s)]
*  two places that I think you know well [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=418.0s)]
*  and particularly in the university context. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=420.8s)]
*  I want to talk about what's been happening there [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=423.08000000000004s)]
*  because that is, for many of us, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=425.64000000000004s)]
*  a signal of the further encroachment [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=428.12s)]
*  upon constitutional rights and norms in this country. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=430.21999999999997s)]
*  And at the beginning of the administration, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=435.32s)]
*  Trump issued an executive order [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=437.8s)]
*  directing the attorney general, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=439.76s)]
*  who was not yet confirmed, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=441.76s)]
*  in consultation with agency heads, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=443.06s)]
*  to submit a report, and I'm going to read to you from it, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=444.5s)]
*  with recommendations for enforcing civil rights laws [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=446.84s)]
*  and taking other appropriate measures [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=449.5s)]
*  to encourage the private sector [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=451.53999999999996s)]
*  to end illegal discrimination and preferences, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=453.09999999999997s)]
*  including DEI. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=455.97999999999996s)]
*  And then he goes on to say that as part of that report, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=457.04s)]
*  every agency should develop a plan to deter DEI [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=459.82s)]
*  by identifying up to nine potential [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  civil compliance investigations of any of the following. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=467.02000000000004s)]
*  Publicly traded corporations, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=471.1s)]
*  large nonprofits and associations, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=472.8s)]
*  foundations with assets of $500 million or more, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=475.14000000000004s)]
*  state bar and local bar and medical associations, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=478.6s)]
*  and then here's the kicker. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=482.74s)]
*  Institutions of higher education [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=483.94s)]
*  with endowments of $1 billion or more. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=485.84s)]
*  When I read that, my jaw dropped, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=488.91999999999996s)]
*  because I was thinking to myself, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=491.11999999999995s)]
*  we should have seen this moment [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  in terms of the assault on universities coming. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=495.08s)]
*  They had already identified on January 20th [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=497.52s)]
*  a mission of going after the largest [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=500.82s)]
*  and most well-funded universities in this country, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=504.4s)]
*  just for context, there are fewer than 90 [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=506.59999999999997s)]
*  educational institutions in the country [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=508.53999999999996s)]
*  that have an endowment of $1 billion or more, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=510.7s)]
*  starting with Harvard at the top, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=513.68s)]
*  with $53 billion, and going on through the 87th, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=515.3399999999999s)]
*  which is like somewhere in the still north [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=519.38s)]
*  of $1 billion easily. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=522.22s)]
*  Should we have seen the attack on universities coming? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=524.12s)]
*  I think we should have seen it coming. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=526.9599999999999s)]
*  I think we should have... [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=528.68s)]
*  Well, did you? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=529.68s)]
*  Yes, yes, for sure. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=530.4599999999999s)]
*  And I think we should have seen it coming [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=531.62s)]
*  long before January 20th. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=533.16s)]
*  It's long been part of the agenda [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=535.1999999999999s)]
*  of people surrounding the Project 2025 project, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=537.5s)]
*  of people in the administration, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=541.9599999999999s)]
*  to go after institutions of higher learning, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=544.1999999999999s)]
*  on the theory that... [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=547.16s)]
*  And you mean just beyond rhetorically, right? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=548.6999999999999s)]
*  Like, this has always been part of Trump's [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=550.4s)]
*  sort of public rhetoric to talk about radical leftists [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=552.8s)]
*  at educational institutions, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=556.24s)]
*  people who need to be controlled, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=557.74s)]
*  that in the name of free speech, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=559.54s)]
*  they have allowed violence. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=561.72s)]
*  That's been part of his public [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=563.18s)]
*  and political persona for a long time, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=565.08s)]
*  but when you're talking about going after universities, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=566.62s)]
*  you're talking about something more concrete than that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=568.68s)]
*  Yes, so actually making it clear [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=570.8199999999999s)]
*  that we're actually making sure that faculty members, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=573.56s)]
*  for example, are ideologically balanced, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=576.96s)]
*  which is something that... [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=580.06s)]
*  I support diversity in faculty hiring, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=581.8s)]
*  but the idea that that's going to be forced [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=585.9s)]
*  by the federal government or that there's something... [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=588.6s)]
*  something illegal happening [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=591.1s)]
*  is a totally different proposition. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=593.68s)]
*  So there's been, for years, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=597.68s)]
*  a kind of culture war battle [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=601.36s)]
*  that universities have participated in. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=603.04s)]
*  Willingly or unwillingly? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=606.64s)]
*  Well, one is you get recruited into the culture wars, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=608.04s)]
*  whether you like it or not, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=611.48s)]
*  and universities have a wide range of views on campuses. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=613.18s)]
*  Students have a wide range of views on campuses, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=616.72s)]
*  and it's part of the spirit of a university. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=619.38s)]
*  That's something that you allow, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=621.86s)]
*  that's something that you want to flourish, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=623.66s)]
*  that's something that you cultivate, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=625.66s)]
*  people formulating different views, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=627.76s)]
*  articulating different views, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=629.26s)]
*  maybe even in provocative ways, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=630.8s)]
*  that's part of the learning process [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=632.3s)]
*  that happens in universities. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=633.96s)]
*  And if your kind of mojo is people need to march in line [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=635.7s)]
*  and people need to follow my own ideology, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=640.44s)]
*  which is, I think, the spirit of much of this administration, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=643.84s)]
*  then this is viewed as enemy territory. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=646.84s)]
*  Well, let's stop there for a second. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=649.38s)]
*  Most people watching this have never been [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  inside a law school faculty lounge. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=654.08s)]
*  I myself have only been like an interloper [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=656.96s)]
*  and invited guest there before. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=658.9399999999999s)]
*  But when you're sitting at a faculty meeting [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=660.68s)]
*  and you're thinking about, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=663.3399999999999s)]
*  if you were to walk into a faculty meeting [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=664.8199999999999s)]
*  and think about your colleagues [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=666.52s)]
*  along a line of viewpoint diversity, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=668.92s)]
*  how difficult is it to break down [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=672.12s)]
*  a law school faculty along those lines? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=674.42s)]
*  I imagine it's more difficult [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=676.12s)]
*  than people who are aligned with Trump [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=677.76s)]
*  actually envision it to be. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=680.26s)]
*  Well, I certainly think in a law school, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=682.66s)]
*  it's a little bit, it's gonna be different [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=684.8399999999999s)]
*  than maybe the rest of the university. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=687.26s)]
*  Lawyers are people who devote their lives [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=690.5s)]
*  to explaining the law, to being lawyers. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=693.3s)]
*  These are not like the most radical people [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=696.44s)]
*  in the society that you'll find. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=698.34s)]
*  They're certainly not the most radical people [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=700.24s)]
*  on a university campus. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  Because even the liberals are institutionalists. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=702.88s)]
*  Yeah, they're institutionalists. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=704.48s)]
*  They believe in the rule of law. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  They believe in institutions. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=706.78s)]
*  A lot of them believe very strongly in making money [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=708.32s)]
*  and in the capitalist system and in supporting it. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=710.38s)]
*  So law schools are pretty centrist. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=713.52s)]
*  I think it's fair to say. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=715.98s)]
*  And I imagine lots of people teach things [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=718.08s)]
*  that are not really ideologically rooted. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=719.62s)]
*  Like I'm thinking about some of the classes [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=721.58s)]
*  I took in law school. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=723.26s)]
*  I took a bankruptcy class. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=724.36s)]
*  I took a business organizations class. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=725.36s)]
*  I took a conflicts of law class. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=726.96s)]
*  To this day, sitting here right now, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=728.86s)]
*  I could not tell you anything [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=731.26s)]
*  about the political ideology of any of the three people [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=732.96s)]
*  who taught me those courses. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=735.44s)]
*  Maybe with some of the common law faculty, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=736.74s)]
*  I have a better sense of that, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=738.2s)]
*  or civil procedure faculty, fed courts, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=739.6s)]
*  because they are teaching about domestic American law [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=741.6s)]
*  and methodology, and sometimes their interpretive methods [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=744.6600000000001s)]
*  are revelatory of their political or philosophical beliefs. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=748.1s)]
*  Not always, though. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=752.1800000000001s)]
*  But there are whole areas of the law [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=753.48s)]
*  that are divorced from constitutional law. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=755.7800000000001s)]
*  And I imagine it's difficult, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=759.12s)]
*  unless you know someone personally, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=760.6800000000001s)]
*  to know where they stand on, let's say, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=762.1800000000001s)]
*  tariffs in the United States. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=764.6600000000001s)]
*  No, that's right. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=766.0200000000001s)]
*  And I don't know that about many of my colleagues. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=767.1600000000001s)]
*  I don't know what their political views are. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  If someone's teaching their trust in the states, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=770.32s)]
*  if someone's teaching corporate finance, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=772.5600000000001s)]
*  you know, they're going to be teaching the materials [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=774.14s)]
*  they need to teach students. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=777.3199999999999s)]
*  But I also don't want to concede the ground [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=778.4799999999999s)]
*  on things like constitutional law, which I teach. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=781.26s)]
*  I don't tell my students what my personal beliefs are [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=784.1199999999999s)]
*  in my class. Could they detect it? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=787.8599999999999s)]
*  If they didn't try to investigate, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=790.4s)]
*  is this person more likely to be liberal or conservative? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=793.3s)]
*  Yeah, they could probably figure that out, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=795.9s)]
*  just as I could figure that out [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=797.1999999999999s)]
*  with conservative professors. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=798.5s)]
*  We all bring our own perspectives [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=799.8s)]
*  and experiences into a classroom. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=803.4s)]
*  As do students. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=805.92s)]
*  As do students. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=807.02s)]
*  But the job of a teacher is to teach everyone, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=808.22s)]
*  is to reach all of your students, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=810.5600000000001s)]
*  is to give all of your students the space [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=811.94s)]
*  to express themselves, to develop their own views [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=814.34s)]
*  of the world, to understand the law on their own terms. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=816.64s)]
*  And I think that's how my colleagues think [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=819.74s)]
*  about the law as well. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=822.44s)]
*  And it's, I think, really dangerous to conflate, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=823.94s)]
*  okay, here's some scholarship that someone's writing, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=827.08s)]
*  or here's something that someone said in public [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=830.28s)]
*  with here's what they're teaching students. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=832.56s)]
*  And I think most faculty members, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=834.36s)]
*  I've spent a lot of time on university campuses [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=836.1999999999999s)]
*  inside law schools and outside law schools. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=838.9399999999999s)]
*  And the classroom is a fairly neutral space. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=841.5s)]
*  I want to come back to that when we talk about [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=845.1999999999999s)]
*  what's been happening with Harvard, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=846.98s)]
*  because that insistence on viewpoint diversity [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=848.24s)]
*  was part of the demands that the administration made. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=850.78s)]
*  But I want to go back now, if we can, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=853.68s)]
*  to sort of the way in which this attack [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=855.8199999999999s)]
*  on universities has evolved. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=857.48s)]
*  One of the first signals that this was coming [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=859.16s)]
*  was that the administration told a number of colleges [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=861.7199999999999s)]
*  that they had to dismantle their DEI programs [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=864.9799999999999s)]
*  or lose federal funding. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=867.2199999999999s)]
*  And the reaction by a lot of colleges and universities [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=869.02s)]
*  was that, well, there's a process for divorcing us [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=872.4599999999999s)]
*  from federal funding. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=875.0s)]
*  And of course, they're going to observe that process. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=876.0999999999999s)]
*  That's what journalists thought too. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=877.64s)]
*  I'm going to read you a passage from an article [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=878.8s)]
*  that the AP wrote about how this was all supposed to go down [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=880.8399999999999s)]
*  and then ask you to react to it. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=884.3s)]
*  They wrote, usually civil rights investigations [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=886.0999999999999s)]
*  by the education department take at least six months [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=888.14s)]
*  and often much longer. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=891.04s)]
*  If a school is found in violation of federal law, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=892.48s)]
*  department policy offers a chance to come into compliance [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=895.02s)]
*  and sign a resolution, typically a 90-day process. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=898.22s)]
*  Only if a school refuses to comply [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=901.82s)]
*  can the department then move to revoke federal money. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=904.26s)]
*  That can be done in the education department [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=907.0s)]
*  through a court-like process [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=908.76s)]
*  decided by an administrative law judge. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=909.9399999999999s)]
*  If the judge decides the penalty is justified, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=912.1s)]
*  the school can appeal it to the education secretary [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=914.3s)]
*  and after that, challenge it in court. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=916.7s)]
*  Instead of handling it internally, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=918.64s)]
*  the department can also refer it to the justice department [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=919.9399999999999s)]
*  for prosecution. That route is no faster. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=921.88s)]
*  Now, the passage I just read could put most people to sleep [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=924.88s)]
*  because it is so imbued with process. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=927.58s)]
*  Is that a fair description of, in a normal world, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=930.58s)]
*  how Title VI investigations, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=934.82s)]
*  meaning investigations of a failure to comply [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=938.36s)]
*  with federal education law about discrimination, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=941.06s)]
*  is that usually how it would have unfolded? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=944.34s)]
*  That's a really fair description of how it usually [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=947.4200000000001s)]
*  would have unfolded and the expectations of universities [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=949.9200000000001s)]
*  and other educational institutions in this space. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=953.16s)]
*  Title VI is a law that says that federal funding [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=957.14s)]
*  can be withdrawn on the basis of discrimination, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=962.08s)]
*  on the basis of race or national origin. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=965.34s)]
*  But Title VI investigations by the Department of Education [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=968.4200000000001s)]
*  are a long, drawn-out process. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=972.82s)]
*  There's an investigation. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=975.22s)]
*  The law itself requires that findings be made on the record [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=976.5799999999999s)]
*  about a potential violation, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=980.74s)]
*  so that requires an investigation. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=982.38s)]
*  The school is usually aware [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=984.52s)]
*  that that investigation is happening. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=986.22s)]
*  There is an opportunity for voluntary compliance, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=988.22s)]
*  which is often a negotiated solution. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=991.72s)]
*  And only after that breaks down is the point [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=993.6s)]
*  at which anyone talks about withdrawing money. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=996.6s)]
*  That's not the point of the law. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=999.74s)]
*  The point of the law is to ensure compliance [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1001.1s)]
*  with federal anti-discrimination law. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1003.1999999999999s)]
*  It's not to take money from institutions. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1005.16s)]
*  And as you think about the history of Title VI, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1007.62s)]
*  there were threats of money being withdrawn [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1010.06s)]
*  during the early civil rights era. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1013.26s)]
*  So Title VI comes out of the civil rights era [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1015.46s)]
*  and trying to make sure that southern schools desegregate [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1018.6s)]
*  after the court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1023.4s)]
*  and part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1027.24s)]
*  Since then, I'm not aware of any instance [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1031.88s)]
*  in which the Department of Education, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1035.3400000000001s)]
*  other than the moment we're in right now, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1036.94s)]
*  has actually withdrawn federal funding [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1038.94s)]
*  on the basis of a Title VI violation. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1041.38s)]
*  Because there's voluntary... [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1043.42s)]
*  We work it out. And institutions are not interested [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1045.42s)]
*  in losing their federal funding, and so they work it out. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1049.22s)]
*  So this kind of shoot first, ask questions later, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1051.6200000000001s)]
*  which is what the administration is doing, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1054.76s)]
*  is totally unprecedented and is inconsistent [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1056.6000000000001s)]
*  with what the law requires. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1059.26s)]
*  When we talk about that process, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1061.0s)]
*  not only is there an opportunity to be heard and negotiate, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1063.24s)]
*  but I assume that usually it's predicated [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1066.24s)]
*  on some fact-based investigation. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1069.0800000000002s)]
*  Here you had an instance where, like, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1071.68s)]
*  not even two months into the administration, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1073.48s)]
*  the Department of Education's sending a letter [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1077.5800000000002s)]
*  to 50-something universities telling them, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1079.42s)]
*  hey, we believe you're in violation [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1082.1200000000001s)]
*  of federal anti-discrimination law. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1083.42s)]
*  Do you have any reason to believe that either justice [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1085.3600000000001s)]
*  or the Education Department is undertaking [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1087.8000000000002s)]
*  the kind of fact-intensive investigations [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1090.36s)]
*  that would normally be necessary [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1093.56s)]
*  before you send that kind of letter? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1096.06s)]
*  So I don't have a lot of visibility [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1098.2s)]
*  into exactly what kind of investigation [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1100.3s)]
*  the Department of Education is conducting [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1102.8s)]
*  or the Department of Justice is conducting. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe they're conducting one, maybe they're not. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1106.54s)]
*  I really don't have a sense of that. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1108.94s)]
*  What we do know is that the letters [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1111.78s)]
*  that universities have received, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1114.02s)]
*  in which they were told that funding is being suspended, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1116.18s)]
*  that other funding is being reviewed, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1119.48s)]
*  did not make reference to any specific findings at all. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1121.42s)]
*  It was just sort of because we... [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1124.92s)]
*  We have reason to believe that or... [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1127.6200000000001s)]
*  you're in violation of. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1130.66s)]
*  We're investigating anti-Semitism. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1131.92s)]
*  I mean, it's at that level of generality [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1133.96s)]
*  without specification of in what way, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1136.26s)]
*  what are the specific actions that you think [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1139.74s)]
*  have violated federal law. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1142.74s)]
*  And so it becomes very hard to even know [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1144.9s)]
*  how to respond to that. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1147.14s)]
*  Because you don't even know the predicate. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1149.18s)]
*  You know, there's a general kind of vibe of, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1151.98s)]
*  you know, we don't like anti-Semitism. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1155.48s)]
*  The universities don't like anti-Semitism either. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1157.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, what is it that you think that we've done? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1160.76s)]
*  How can we correct that? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1164.26s)]
*  None of that is in these letters. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1166.0600000000002s)]
*  It's just we believe that anti-Semitism is bad [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1167.76s)]
*  and therefore you must do all these things. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1171.8000000000002s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Or we believe that anti-Semitism exists [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1173.44s)]
*  because students feel unwelcome. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1176.22s)]
*  Students have had that experience. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1179.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, I want to go to talking about Colombia. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1181.1000000000001s)]
*  But before we talk about what has happened to Colombia [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1183.8600000000001s)]
*  over the last several weeks, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1186.9s)]
*  there are some who in the wake of the protests [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1188.94s)]
*  at Colombia last year would say, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1191.74s)]
*  Colombia deserves to lose federal funding [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1194.48s)]
*  because it has failed to sufficiently protect [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1196.64s)]
*  Jewish students on its campus from harassment [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1198.98s)]
*  or from equal access to education. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1201.5200000000002s)]
*  What's your reaction to that as somebody [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1203.76s)]
*  who works on the Colombia campus? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1205.34s)]
*  So I work on the Colombia campus. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1207.04s)]
*  I was not working on the Colombia campus [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1208.84s)]
*  during the protests. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1211.18s)]
*  I was at the Department of Justice at the time. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1212.3799999999999s)]
*  But there have been lawsuits filed by students [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1214.62s)]
*  against Colombia under Title VI. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1217.56s)]
*  Those get either settled or adjudicated. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1219.76s)]
*  The question of whether, and this is the standard under, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1222.6s)]
*  when you bring a suit for money damages in court [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1226.2s)]
*  based on a Title VII violation, is whether... [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1230.04s)]
*  You mean Title VI violation, okay. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1232.44s)]
*  Title VI violation is whether the school [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1233.82s)]
*  has been deliberately indifferent to some severe [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1237.56s)]
*  and pervasive harassment of students [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1241.3s)]
*  such that it interferes with their ability [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1247.3s)]
*  to participate in the educational process. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1249.34s)]
*  Whether or not that happened at some point in the past, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1252.08s)]
*  which I'm not offering a view about, I wasn't there. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1254.92s)]
*  I don't know all the facts. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1258.02s)]
*  Some of those things are being adjudicated in court. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1260.28s)]
*  The question of whether Colombia is abiding [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1262.86s)]
*  by its obligations under Title VI now, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1267.36s)]
*  is I think the idea that Colombia is deliberately indifferent [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1271.5s)]
*  to harassment of Jewish students on campus [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1276.04s)]
*  is not a plausible claim. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1279.54s)]
*  Colombia has done... [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1281.18s)]
*  And the here and now? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1282.58s)]
*  In the here and now. Colombia has done quite a lot [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1283.78s)]
*  in response to criticism of its response to the protests. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1285.3799999999999s)]
*  But even if we were to talk about the past, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1290.02s)]
*  for example, my understanding is a university [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1292.26s)]
*  could be responsible in the present for past conduct [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1294.52s)]
*  as long as you're within a certain statute of limitations. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1297.76s)]
*  But even then, there would have to be a robust process [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1300.16s)]
*  of some sort to prove the deliberate indifference [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1304.2s)]
*  that has a severe and pervasive impact [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1306.94s)]
*  and that interferes with the student's ability to learn. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1309.28s)]
*  Those are the three sort of fact-intensive inquiries [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1311.94s)]
*  that go along with some form of Title VI inquiry, correct? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1314.84s)]
*  No, that's exactly right, which is why it's very important [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1319.52s)]
*  and very difficult to even know how to respond [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1322.28s)]
*  to these interventions by the government. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1325.68s)]
*  Is this in reference to some sort of past incidents [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1327.96s)]
*  in which Colombia is in some sense being punished [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1332.22s)]
*  or held liable for now? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1335.96s)]
*  That's one set of arguments that one can make arguments about. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1338.0s)]
*  Or is this about something ongoing or is ongoing policies [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1343.74s)]
*  the way in which the government has asked [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1347.24s)]
*  at least some universities to respond to these allegations, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1350.36s)]
*  suggest that there's some ongoing problems. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1353.74s)]
*  But it's hard to know what that is [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1355.74s)]
*  or how it relates to Title VI. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1357.74s)]
*  It's even harder, I think, for people who are outside [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1359.6799999999998s)]
*  these institutions to get their hands around that [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1361.6399999999999s)]
*  because not all of the correspondence [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1363.9399999999998s)]
*  is of course public. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1365.54s)]
*  We only see what the universities [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1366.74s)]
*  and or the administration want us to see. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1368.78s)]
*  Sometimes that's a very one-sided account [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1371.36s)]
*  of the correspondence. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1374.06s)]
*  Sometimes in the case of Harvard, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1375.26s)]
*  which we'll talk about in a few minutes, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1376.4199999999998s)]
*  we have seen both sides of sort of the bid and response. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1378.04s)]
*  You know, the administration essentially said to Colombia, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1384.1200000000001s)]
*  we're going to eliminate hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1387.26s)]
*  in grant funding, notably for medical research, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1389.06s)]
*  and we're not going to stop until you agree to a few things. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1391.76s)]
*  One of them is reforming your admissions policies. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1394.3600000000001s)]
*  The second is we're going to place certain academic departments, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1397.16s)]
*  particularly those that have some touch point [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1400.0s)]
*  in the Middle East in receivership. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1404.08s)]
*  And you're going to give us direct oversight [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1408.46s)]
*  of your hiring and your curriculum. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1410.96s)]
*  What was the university's response to that? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1414.36s)]
*  So I don't know that I would characterize [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1417.1s)]
*  the demands in quite that way. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1419.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1420.7s)]
*  So the government wanted Colombia [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1421.6s)]
*  to put a particular department into receivership. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1425.04s)]
*  Receivership meaning that someone [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1429.54s)]
*  from the central administration has some control [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1431.8999999999999s)]
*  over that particular, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1435.58s)]
*  central Colombia administration, not the federal government. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1437.08s)]
*  Colombia's administration has some control [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1440.28s)]
*  over the conduct of that particular department. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1443.08s)]
*  Not like an emissary from the Department of Education? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1447.28s)]
*  No, not someone from the federal government. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1449.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm not aware of any demands about curriculum reform [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1451.26s)]
*  that were made by the government. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1454.52s)]
*  There was a demand that Colombia align its admissions practices [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1456.8s)]
*  with federal law and policy. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1460.8s)]
*  I'm not aware of any kind of concession [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1462.98s)]
*  along those lines that Colombia has made. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1465.78s)]
*  Now, Colombia did say we're going to negotiate [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1468.42s)]
*  with the federal government. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1470.92s)]
*  The government said, you know, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1472.52s)]
*  in order to even continue our conversation, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1474.22s)]
*  you've got to agree to a few things. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1476.62s)]
*  So they agreed to a mask ban for certain kinds of protests. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1478.46s)]
*  They agreed to further empowering [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1482.76s)]
*  some of the public safety officers on campus, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1486.3s)]
*  giving some further presidential control [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1489.82s)]
*  over some of the internal disciplinary processes. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1492.52s)]
*  Presidential meaning Colombia's president? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1496.1599999999999s)]
*  Colombia's president. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1497.86s)]
*  So none of the, at least publicly, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1498.9599999999998s)]
*  and I'm just speaking about public reports. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1501.5s)]
*  I'm not part of the negotiations in any way. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1503.3999999999999s)]
*  But publicly, what Colombia has agreed to [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1507.1s)]
*  is a set of internal governance reforms, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1510.3799999999999s)]
*  many of which have been urged by people at Colombia. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1513.8s)]
*  So there's a kind of internal politics going on at Colombia [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1517.18s)]
*  that the federal government is being used to leverage. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1520.8200000000002s)]
*  Did any of that result in the winding back [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1523.88s)]
*  of the first 400-something million [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1527.8600000000001s)]
*  paused in grants to Colombia? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1530.6200000000001s)]
*  No. And as far as I know, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1532.6200000000001s)]
*  there's been no kind of final agreement [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1534.3600000000001s)]
*  between Colombia and the federal government. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1536.26s)]
*  So Colombia has said, we want this conversation to continue, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1538.3400000000001s)]
*  and so here are the internal governance reforms [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1543.38s)]
*  that you said we should do. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1546.08s)]
*  Some of these are things we were going to do anyway. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1547.78s)]
*  Some of these are things that we're accelerating. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1549.98s)]
*  So now let's keep talking. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1551.92s)]
*  And so that's where Colombia is. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1553.1399999999999s)]
*  The president of another university, Princeton, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1555.02s)]
*  which is led by Chris Eisgruber, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1557.42s)]
*  who himself is a former law professor of many years, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1558.86s)]
*  called what has happened with Colombia, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1562.8999999999999s)]
*  and I'm quoting, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1566.3999999999999s)]
*  the greatest threat to American universities [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1567.46s)]
*  since the Red Scare of the 1950s. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1569.46s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1572.26s)]
*  I think that's accurate. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1573.5s)]
*  I think that's accurate. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1574.6599999999999s)]
*  And as we think about what we're worried about [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1575.9599999999998s)]
*  from the federal government, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1579.84s)]
*  the government trying to control the way [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1581.58s)]
*  in which universities admit students, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1586.28s)]
*  the way in which they structure their education, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1588.7199999999998s)]
*  the way in which they hire faculty, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1591.52s)]
*  those were the kinds of things [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1593.52s)]
*  that you saw during the Red Scare and McCarthyism [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1595.1799999999998s)]
*  and trying to keep people who were viewed [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1598.4599999999998s)]
*  as being affiliated with communism [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1602.0s)]
*  and also of university campuses. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1603.52s)]
*  I think in a lot of ways, this is even worse [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1605.2s)]
*  because it involves efforts to control [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1607.96s)]
*  the entirety of the university's operations [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1611.64s)]
*  as we're seeing in the context of Harvard University. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1614.3s)]
*  And it's not black and white, right? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1617.04s)]
*  It's not like, do you have fidelity [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1618.18s)]
*  to a particular viewpoint or not? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1620.08s)]
*  Are you a member of the Communist Party or are you not? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1621.92s)]
*  Even if that was a fictitious question to ask [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1624.38s)]
*  with respect to some of the people, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1628.92s)]
*  it's much more nebulous than that. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1630.26s)]
*  Absolutely. Universities could survive [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1631.9199999999998s)]
*  if they had no communists on their campus, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1634.08s)]
*  as bad as the Red Scare was. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1637.08s)]
*  Universities can't survive if the federal government [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1639.82s)]
*  in some nebulous, vague way controls who they hire, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1642.36s)]
*  what their curriculum looks like, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1645.6s)]
*  who's empowered internally, who they admit [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1647.1399999999999s)]
*  and how they admit their students. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1649.6s)]
*  That is not in any fundamental sense [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1651.3s)]
*  a university anymore, it's a federal entity. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1653.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, let's take a step back, right? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1656.3799999999999s)]
*  Because you and I are having this conversation [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1657.4799999999998s)]
*  at a certain level of abstraction. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1658.8799999999999s)]
*  The things that they want are, as you just said, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1660.5s)]
*  the things that would make a university not a university. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1663.2s)]
*  Now let's put that in the language of the law. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1665.46s)]
*  What's legally problematic about some of the demands [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1668.04s)]
*  as themselves non-specific or evolving as some of them are? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1672.7s)]
*  When you look at or think about the public reporting [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1677.72s)]
*  about the demands to Columbia, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1680.98s)]
*  if you had to translate that to your students [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1682.42s)]
*  or even better, maybe to a family member, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1685.3200000000002s)]
*  what's legally objectionable about that? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1687.02s)]
*  How would you describe that? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1688.96s)]
*  Well, I would say there's a few problems. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1690.34s)]
*  Some of them have to do with the law [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1692.68s)]
*  that the federal government seems to be relying on, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1694.3799999999999s)]
*  which is Title VI. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1697.82s)]
*  And some of them have to do with basic constitutional protections [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1699.46s)]
*  for due process of law and under the First Amendment [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1703.86s)]
*  and freedom of speech. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1706.66s)]
*  So as to the law itself, there are procedures [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1708.76s)]
*  that the law puts in place. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1711.14s)]
*  This is before you withdraw funding, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1712.6s)]
*  you have to make findings on the record, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1715.1s)]
*  you have to be to give the university [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1717.14s)]
*  an opportunity to defend itself and to have a hearing, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1719.6s)]
*  you have to make a certain report to Congress, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1722.1s)]
*  you have to wait a certain period, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1724.24s)]
*  you have to try to do a voluntary agreement, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1725.74s)]
*  and all of that's been just kind of blown past. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1727.3999999999999s)]
*  None of that has happened as far as I'm aware. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1730.28s)]
*  So there's just a violation of the process under the law. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1733.04s)]
*  Part of the reason that process is in place [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1736.1799999999998s)]
*  is because the Constitution requires, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1738.8799999999999s)]
*  before you take away very significant amounts of money [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1741.12s)]
*  from some institution and say it's engaged in anti-Semitism [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1744.86s)]
*  or some other improper behavior, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1749.12s)]
*  you have to give it a right to defend itself. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1750.58s)]
*  I know that's foundational for you and me, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1752.82s)]
*  that institutions have due process rights as well, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1755.02s)]
*  but I think that's not always as clear [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1757.6599999999999s)]
*  to people who watch our network or watch even programs like this [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1759.9199999999998s)]
*  that attempt to go a little weirder and nerdier, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1763.6999999999998s)]
*  that institutions are legal people as well. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1766.56s)]
*  They have constitutional rights too. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1770.8999999999999s)]
*  That's right. And institutions, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1773.1999999999998s)]
*  the Supreme Court has said this many times, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1774.74s)]
*  that they're collections of people. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1776.74s)]
*  Corporations are people. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1778.3799999999999s)]
*  Corporations are collections of people. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1779.72s)]
*  And, you know, that can lead to some kind of weird outcomes, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1781.22s)]
*  but in this instance, you're talking about an accusation [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1785.1799999999998s)]
*  made against an academic institution [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1788.32s)]
*  and a very significant amount of money. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1791.12s)]
*  And that money translates directly into research, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1793.3999999999999s)]
*  medical trials, the vibrancy of the medical school. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1797.6999999999998s)]
*  These are real people, real jobs, real livelihoods. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1801.9399999999998s)]
*  So it's not just sort of money in the abstract. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1805.0s)]
*  Before you can take that away, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1807.3799999999999s)]
*  you have to be able to give someone an opportunity to say, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1809.4399999999998s)]
*  well, no, I don't think I did the thing [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1812.32s)]
*  that you've accused me of doing. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1813.82s)]
*  Or you're not understanding the facts in the correct way. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1816.22s)]
*  That's a fundamental principle of American constitutional law, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1818.9599999999998s)]
*  and it applies here. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1822.02s)]
*  Can you drill down a little bit on the First Amendment concerns? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1823.72s)]
*  Again, like, people watching this understand [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1826.9599999999998s)]
*  First Amendment's about freedom of the press, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1829.26s)]
*  freedom of speech, freedom of association. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1831.5s)]
*  But specifically, when we're talking about [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1833.6399999999999s)]
*  some of the concessions that the administration [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1835.86s)]
*  wanted from Columbia and or has asked for [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1838.0s)]
*  from other peer universities right now, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1840.8s)]
*  how would you describe the First Amendment harm or harms? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1842.8s)]
*  I would say there's kind of two big [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1846.34s)]
*  First Amendment problems here. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1849.02s)]
*  Putting them in buckets? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1850.44s)]
*  I'm putting them in buckets. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1851.54s)]
*  First bucket is academic freedom, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1852.72s)]
*  which is the Supreme Court has said in the past [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1855.86s)]
*  is a special concern of the First Amendment. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1860.12s)]
*  The ability of people on an educational campus [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1863.8999999999999s)]
*  to express themselves, to not have someone else [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1868.5s)]
*  try to control their viewpoint. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1871.3999999999999s)]
*  And it was McCarthy-era cases [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1872.8999999999999s)]
*  where the Supreme Court announced that, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1875.3999999999999s)]
*  you know, the First Amendment concerns us all, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1878.24s)]
*  we're all protected by the First Amendment, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1880.34s)]
*  but academic freedom is especially important [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1882.02s)]
*  because this is an incubator for democratic citizens. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1884.52s)]
*  Well, obviously, the court has evolved a lot [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1888.08s)]
*  since the 1950s. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1890.02s)]
*  Is there a recent precedent that would give [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1891.32s)]
*  someone like you reason to pause and say, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1893.18s)]
*  I'm not sure that those precedents are as vital today [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1896.0600000000002s)]
*  as they were in the McCarthy era? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1898.66s)]
*  You know, believe it or not, no, not really. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1899.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, the Supreme Court is certainly more conservative [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1901.8600000000001s)]
*  than it was at that time along a variety of dimensions. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1904.1000000000001s)]
*  But one of the ways in which they're not more conservative [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1907.9s)]
*  is in the First Amendment area. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1910.14s)]
*  And the Supreme Court has been very protective [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1912.4s)]
*  of First Amendment rights as a general matter. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1914.9s)]
*  Not every single justice on the court, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1917.0400000000002s)]
*  but the court has been very First Amendment forward. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1919.38s)]
*  And here, the interference with academic freedom, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1921.94s)]
*  I think, is pretty direct. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1924.3400000000001s)]
*  When the federal government tries to use [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1926.44s)]
*  massive amounts of money to leverage [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1928.94s)]
*  whom faculties hire, which is among the demands [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1932.0800000000002s)]
*  that have been made to Harvard University, for example, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1935.5800000000002s)]
*  and what their admissions practices are, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1938.7600000000002s)]
*  how they discipline their students, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1941.7600000000002s)]
*  which is a demand that's been made [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1943.5600000000002s)]
*  both of Columbia and other institutions. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1945.16s)]
*  That goes straight to the core of the university [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1947.5s)]
*  and the university's own decision-making [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1951.3999999999999s)]
*  about how it's going to structure [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1953.9599999999998s)]
*  the educational environment on campus. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1955.5s)]
*  And that's a direct academic freedom threat. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1957.54s)]
*  Okay, second bucket. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1960.1s)]
*  There's a second bucket, which is, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1961.1999999999998s)]
*  even if you put to one side the academic freedom issue, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1963.74s)]
*  there's something in First Amendment law [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1966.9399999999998s)]
*  called vagueness or over-breath, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1969.72s)]
*  meaning the law goes, what the government [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1971.6799999999998s)]
*  is trying to ask you to do just goes way beyond [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1975.06s)]
*  what they can lawfully ask you to do. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1978.22s)]
*  So, if I say, you know, I'm going to take your money away [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1980.04s)]
*  unless you please the king. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1983.22s)]
*  And I say, well, how can I please the king? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1986.32s)]
*  I don't know, I'll tell you later. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1988.3600000000001s)]
*  But please, make sure you please the king. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1990.66s)]
*  Well, I'm going to start to really monitor [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1993.0s)]
*  my own behavior and self-police [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1995.7s)]
*  so that I can try to make sure I please the king. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=1997.76s)]
*  And that itself is an incursion on your speech, right? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2000.5s)]
*  And so, even if there was something [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2002.4s)]
*  they could get me to do, the fact that they've been [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2004.2s)]
*  so vague about it means that I'm going to, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2006.3s)]
*  my own speech is going to be, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2010.24s)]
*  I'm going to suppress my own speech. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2012.64s)]
*  And that is a first, the Supreme Court has said [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2014.44s)]
*  that's a First Amendment problem in itself [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2016.34s)]
*  because you are really getting people [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2019.04s)]
*  to stifle their own free expression [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2022.18s)]
*  because you've been so vague about what they need to do. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2026.58s)]
*  I'm thinking about the letter that was sent to Harvard, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2029.02s)]
*  and one of the things that's in that letter [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2032.1200000000001s)]
*  is reducing the power of students [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2034.02s)]
*  and also reducing the power of faculty, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2036.42s)]
*  whether tenured or untenured, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2038.68s)]
*  with respect to those who are more interested [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2042.28s)]
*  in activism than scholarship. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2045.3200000000002s)]
*  That seems to me to be the epitome of something [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2047.22s)]
*  that would present that vagueness concern [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2050.02s)]
*  from a First Amendment standpoint. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2052.52s)]
*  Yes, no, absolutely. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2053.76s)]
*  And a school can't receive that kind of demand [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2055.16s)]
*  and A, know what they need to do, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2058.66s)]
*  or B, accept that kind of demand [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2061.54s)]
*  and still maintain their autonomy [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2063.44s)]
*  as an educational institution. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2065.54s)]
*  And that's a First Amendment problem [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2067.2599999999998s)]
*  along multiple dimensions. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2068.8199999999997s)]
*  Even if you put to one side all the due process issues [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2070.4599999999996s)]
*  and the fact that they're violating the statute [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2073.3999999999996s)]
*  that they're purporting to be using [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2075.2999999999997s)]
*  as a basis for their action. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2077.7s)]
*  I want to talk about something [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2079.8399999999997s)]
*  that's not so much First Amendment related, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2081.3399999999997s)]
*  although actually it is, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2083.68s)]
*  but sort of is conceptualized right now [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2085.04s)]
*  in a different domain, and that's the immigration sphere. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2087.4399999999996s)]
*  It's not lost on me as you and I are having this conversation, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2089.9199999999996s)]
*  and we talked a couple of days ago, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2092.4799999999996s)]
*  that there are at least three Columbia students [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2095.08s)]
*  who have been caught in the crosshairs [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2098.04s)]
*  of this administration's prioritization [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2100.14s)]
*  of sort of policing student activism. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2102.7799999999997s)]
*  Talk to me about what that's like to be on Columbia's campus [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2105.18s)]
*  during a period where people that students know [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2107.88s)]
*  are victims of... [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2112.62s)]
*  this policy. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2117.46s)]
*  Students are very afraid. They're very anxious. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2119.2s)]
*  They're policing their own speech. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2122.98s)]
*  There have been anecdotal reports of people [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2124.62s)]
*  asking the student newspaper to take their names [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2127.42s)]
*  off of articles they've written. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2129.62s)]
*  There's this sort of core protected activity [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2131.62s)]
*  and people who have any kind of vulnerability [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2135.1s)]
*  in their immigration status. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2138.3s)]
*  And here we're talking about lawful permanent residence, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2139.56s)]
*  which is one step before citizenship. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2142.0s)]
*  People who have every right to be in the country, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2144.5s)]
*  have every right to express their viewpoints. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2147.1s)]
*  And people in that category, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2149.28s)]
*  and anyone who's more vulnerable than that. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2151.7999999999997s)]
*  So someone who's here on a student visa, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2153.54s)]
*  which is many of our international students, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2155.9399999999996s)]
*  are just terrified. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2158.4399999999996s)]
*  They can't speak their mind. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2159.58s)]
*  They can't engage in ordinary activity [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2160.7799999999997s)]
*  of writing for their student newspaper. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2166.68s)]
*  Some of these people seem to have had visas revoked [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2169.4199999999996s)]
*  for parking tickets and other things. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2173.12s)]
*  So there's, I think, an important element of this, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2175.12s)]
*  which is there's a lot of fear on campus. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2178.66s)]
*  People are suppressing their speech [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2181.1s)]
*  just from being scared of the tactics [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2183.2s)]
*  of this administration. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2185.88s)]
*  But also, what this is showing the school [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2187.48s)]
*  from the federal government's perspective [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2192.04s)]
*  is we have other leverage over you. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2194.2799999999997s)]
*  So it's not just, here's $400 million, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2198.12s)]
*  here's a few other billion dollars of future contracts, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2201.42s)]
*  which is also part of the mix here. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2203.86s)]
*  But we also can revoke visas. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2205.92s)]
*  And we can decide not to provide visas. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2209.4s)]
*  And make it less attractive for people to attend your... [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2211.96s)]
*  And people won't even want to come. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2213.7400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2215.1s)]
*  And so the 14,000 international students on campus, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2216.14s)]
*  how many of them are going to come back? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2218.98s)]
*  I want to talk about Harvard for a second. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2220.58s)]
*  The administration gave Harvard a lengthy letter [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2222.44s)]
*  listing a set of demands. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2226.98s)]
*  Some of them we've touched on earlier, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2229.32s)]
*  like the demand that you reduce the power of students, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2231.16s)]
*  or you reduce the power of faculty members [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2233.96s)]
*  who are more committed to activism than scholarship. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2236.56s)]
*  Some of them were remarkably concrete and specific, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2239.92s)]
*  like immediately ban masks, or commit to us that [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2242.6600000000003s)]
*  where a foreign student has a conduct violation, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2245.8s)]
*  you're going to pick up the phone and call [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2248.1600000000003s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2250.2400000000002s)]
*  and the State Department. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2251.44s)]
*  And Harvard had $9 billion on the line. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2252.84s)]
*  And despite that, it recently told the administration, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2256.78s)]
*  essentially, no, we are not going to play this game [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2260.1200000000003s)]
*  and accede to your demands. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2263.52s)]
*  We have First Amendment concerns about it. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2264.94s)]
*  We have statutory rights that you haven't recognized. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2266.6400000000003s)]
*  And while we're always open to a dialogue with you, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2269.78s)]
*  we are not going to agree to any, if not all, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2273.92s)]
*  of the demands in your letter. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2278.2200000000003s)]
*  Given how large of an endowment Harvard [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2280.1600000000003s)]
*  has, the largest in the country, how significant [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2282.4s)]
*  is their decision to tell the administration no? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2285.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it's very significant in large part [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2289.6400000000003s)]
*  because it's the first real defiance [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2292.22s)]
*  of an administration demand from one of these universities. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2295.46s)]
*  Now, the demands were extremely intrusive. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2299.0s)]
*  And as far as I can tell, no other university [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2301.3999999999996s)]
*  has gotten demands that were this micromanaging [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2304.8999999999996s)]
*  of Harvard's academic mission when [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2309.4399999999996s)]
*  it comes to student discipline, when it comes to admissions, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2312.22s)]
*  when it comes to faculty on campus. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2315.02s)]
*  So in some sense, maybe they just had to say no, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2317.18s)]
*  and no one would have said yes under those circumstances. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2320.34s)]
*  But Harvard also has a very large endowment. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2323.54s)]
*  They, more than any other institution in the world, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2326.38s)]
*  would be able to weather this kind of storm, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2329.52s)]
*  a $50 billion plus endowment. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2333.02s)]
*  Now, of course, it's important to keep in mind [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2335.26s)]
*  that an endowment is not like a piggy bank [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2337.76s)]
*  that the university can just draw from. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2339.6600000000003s)]
*  Funds that are in an endowment, most of which, most of those [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2342.94s)]
*  are committed to specific projects, specific centers, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2346.2400000000002s)]
*  specific lines of research. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2349.88s)]
*  Or just restricted, and they can't [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2351.1800000000003s)]
*  be used in the present sense. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2352.32s)]
*  Or they're restricted, and they can't be drawn down. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2353.46s)]
*  So it's not as if Harvard can just [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2356.1200000000003s)]
*  sort of take money from one area of its endowment [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2357.46s)]
*  and spend it for something else. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2361.0600000000004s)]
*  We didn't have much of an opportunity [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2362.6400000000003s)]
*  to talk about law firms because we got so absorbed [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2364.2400000000002s)]
*  in talking about universities. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2366.4s)]
*  But I want to do a quick lightning round if we can. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2368.0s)]
*  There are four law firms to date that [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2370.94s)]
*  have obtained temporary restraining orders [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2372.94s)]
*  against the administration's executive orders. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2374.6800000000003s)]
*  Do those law firms continue to provide [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2377.52s)]
*  or continue to prevail in their litigation? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2379.4s)]
*  I think it's very likely that there's [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2381.7400000000002s)]
*  a pretty significant First Amendment problem [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2383.54s)]
*  with deciding you're going to go after law firms based [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2385.48s)]
*  on who their clients are or the views of the people who [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2388.02s)]
*  work at the law firm. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2391.02s)]
*  Do you think we see any of the law firms that [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2392.06s)]
*  have already settled, so to speak, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2394.1600000000003s)]
*  because there is no paperwork, as far as we know, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2396.32s)]
*  with the administration rescind those settlements [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2398.5s)]
*  and go back on them, given what we understand [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2400.96s)]
*  from public reporting is sort of an escalating expectation [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2403.2000000000003s)]
*  on the administration's behalf of what they're [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2407.04s)]
*  going to do as part of that settlement? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2408.68s)]
*  I think it's possible. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2410.72s)]
*  You have a very kind of capricious negotiating partner [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2412.02s)]
*  here. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2415.2599999999998s)]
*  And so that's certainly possible [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2416.2599999999998s)]
*  if there's no firm agreement. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2418.1s)]
*  What do you think the Supreme Court is going to do [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2419.7s)]
*  if and when it gets involved in one of these university [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2423.2599999999998s)]
*  versus administration disputes? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2426.74s)]
*  Well, that's, I think, very far down the line. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2429.48s)]
*  But I think there are certain pretty clear legal lines [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2432.04s)]
*  to draw here, which is they have not complied with the Title [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2437.0s)]
*  VI statute that they seem to be drawing on. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2439.98s)]
*  And the Supreme Court in particular [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2442.44s)]
*  doesn't like to go beyond what it [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2445.32s)]
*  needs to do to decide a case. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2447.7200000000003s)]
*  And so if I had to guess, I'd say, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2449.06s)]
*  and I'm not sure it ever gets there, but if it did, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2450.82s)]
*  I would say they say the process wasn't followed here. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2453.26s)]
*  So at the beginning of this, we talked about, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2456.0s)]
*  are we in a constitutional crisis yet? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2458.1s)]
*  And I thought you were going to say no. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2459.96s)]
*  And I was going to periodically have to ask you [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2462.3s)]
*  during this conversation, are we there [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2464.7400000000002s)]
*  yet? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2466.94s)]
*  Instead, you told me from the very beginning, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2468.2400000000002s)]
*  we're already there. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2469.28s)]
*  And all I can think about is, I want [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2470.58s)]
*  to get off of this car ride. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2471.82s)]
*  So thank you for coming to Can They Do That? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2473.82s)]
*  And hopefully, we can do this again soon. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2475.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-CWuO3KSpo&t=2477.48s)]
