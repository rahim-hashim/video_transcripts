# The ‘Trump honeymoon’ is over: Democrats continue town hall push in deep red districts
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY)
*  This week, House Republicans are scrambling to get their budget bill across the finish line. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=0.0s)]
*  But Speaker Mike Johnson is facing major pushback, both from swing district moderates fighting to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=4.64s)]
*  protect Medicaid and conservatives demanding at least $2 trillion in cuts just to stay at the table. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=10.08s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democrats across the country are calling on their elected officials [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=17.04s)]
*  to do more to resist Trump's agenda. And one young member of Congress is pushing his colleagues to, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=21.04s)]
*  in his words, get caught fighting. Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost says too many in Congress [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=27.76s)]
*  brush off social media as a distraction. But to him, it's part of the job. As he put it, quote, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  if you just wanted to write bills, you should probably apply for a staff position at Ledge [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=40.88s)]
*  Council. Our job is much more than that. That's a big part of it. But a big part of it is communicating. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=45.6s)]
*  And Frost, along with Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, is leading by example, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=53.36s)]
*  taking the fight directly into Republican backyards. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=58.8s)]
*  I'm so proud to be here with you all. This isn't about Democrats versus Republicans. It's about [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=64.24s)]
*  the people versus the problem. Donald Trump is the problem. Elon Musk is the problem. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=69.84s)]
*  And if you're here and you voted for Trump in the past, my message is simple. I'm sorry you were lied [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=75.6s)]
*  to, but welcome to the team. All right, Congressman Hudson, me and Maxwell and your chair and your [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=84.16s)]
*  minority leader, we came here because apparently you are not willing to talk to your constituents, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=90.0s)]
*  but there's a few of your constituents that are here with us today. And they have a question for [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  you. Wow. Just one hour from now, Senator Murphy and Congressman Frost continue their town hall [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=100.32s)]
*  tour in Florida's deep red 17th congressional district. And they join us now. Senator and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  Congressman, I'm just welcome. But also, what is the reaction? What kinds of reactions are you [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  getting from your Republican colleagues about the fact that you're rolling into [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=125.68s)]
*  their districts, into red districts holding town halls? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=130.72s)]
*  Well, listen, I mean, they've made an extraordinary decision, which is to hide from their constituents. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=135.76000000000002s)]
*  I guess it's not surprising because what they are doing is wildly and historically unpopular. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  They are green lighting a level of corruption in this White House that we have never ever seen [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=146.08s)]
*  before in this nation. They are talking about voting for the most massive transfer of wealth [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=150.72s)]
*  and resources from the poor and the middle class to the rich that we've ever seen before in this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=157.2s)]
*  country. That's the cut in Medicaid funding that would throw millions off their health care [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=161.2s)]
*  insurance in order to finance a tax cut for the very, very wealthy. And so, of course, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=164.96s)]
*  if you're doing those things, if you're turning the entire government over to the billionaire [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=169.84s)]
*  class, you probably don't want to be held accountable. So the congressman here in Sarasota, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=173.6s)]
*  Greg Stubbe, is not holding town halls. And I think that every voter in this country should [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=178.16s)]
*  have an opportunity to hear what's happening in Washington, to hear about the corruption and the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=184.16s)]
*  thievery, and to express their opinions. So Maxwell and I have been traveling the country, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=188.4s)]
*  doing town halls in Republican districts where Republicans are hiding. And I don't think it's a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=193.04s)]
*  coincidence that as we've been on this tour, as Bernie and AOC have been doing similar events, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=199.6s)]
*  as we've been allowing Republican voters to have a voice, we've seen Donald Trump's approval [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=204.72s)]
*  ratings and Republicans' approval ratings crater. It's a little bit harder for them to get [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=209.44s)]
*  the things they want passed that would hurt regular people now that their voters are actually [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  informed about what's happening. Congressman Frost, I just want to continue talking about [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=218.16s)]
*  what you're hearing from voters in these red districts. I know you're in Florida today and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  you represent a district in Florida, but what are you hearing from the voters who normally vote [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  Republican at these town halls? Yeah, well one of my favorite parts about these town halls is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=233.92s)]
*  getting to meet with people afterwards. We always get off the stage and go out in the crowd to speak [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  with people, to hear directly from them, especially from people who weren't able to ask a question. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  And I've been meeting people of all different types of political persuasions, and really the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=248.72s)]
*  questions they have are based on how all these big national decisions are impacting them locally. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=253.2s)]
*  I've heard a lot about veterans and VA benefits and the local VA's being decimated staff-wise [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=258.88s)]
*  and them not being able to get the services that they deserve, that they earned, and that our [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=265.2s)]
*  country fulfills the promise we've made to those who've put their life on the line for our democracy [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=269.68s)]
*  and for our nation. Not just that, I'm hearing about how cuts at Social Security Administration [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=274.24s)]
*  is impacting the ability for seniors and people on disability to be able to get their benefits. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=278.64s)]
*  People are dying waiting, literally people are dying waiting to get their disability benefits [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  right now, in part because of the massive cuts we've seen at the Social Security Administration, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=288.32s)]
*  an agency that now has less people working at it than it did in 1994. And so all of this is on [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  purpose, and our message is very simple. They're taking these things away, these earned benefits, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=301.44s)]
*  the things that working people and working Americans have fought for for generations to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  give billionaires like Elon Musk and like Donald Trump himself a tax cut. And as we're talking about [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=310.64s)]
*  this message everywhere, it's really not about Democrat versus Republican, it's about the people [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=316.48s)]
*  versus the problem. And we've found that it's resonating for Democrats, Republicans, independents, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=320.72s)]
*  progressives, moderates, conservatives alike, because people are seeing in front of them the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=325.44s)]
*  real impact. You can't really spin local impact sitting in Washington, D.C. And that's part of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=330.24s)]
*  the reason we're on this tour, to speak with people directly and hear from them about what's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=336.24s)]
*  going on and how we can fight against it together. Senator Chris Murphy, you are a lawyer as well as a [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=341.28s)]
*  senator, and I'm curious what you think about the White House apparently quote looking at [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  suspending habeas corpus and kind of what that means for the rule of law in this country. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=353.2s)]
*  You know, one of the ways that I think about the Republicans that are showing up to these events [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=360.0s)]
*  and our doors are open to everybody, Democrats, independents, political, non-political voters, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=364.79999999999995s)]
*  one of the things I think about the Republicans who show up is this, they voted for Donald Trump [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=370.0s)]
*  and they voted for Donald Trump because they took him seriously when he said he was going to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=374.4s)]
*  tackle costs and lower their cost of living, but they didn't take him seriously when he said during [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=378.56s)]
*  the campaign that he was going to be a dictator. And it turns out that the opposite is true. It [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=383.35999999999996s)]
*  turns out that he is doing, well, he's not doing nothing about costs, he's actually raising people's [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=387.28s)]
*  costs with these inane tariffs. And he was serious and he is serious about suspending the rule of law [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=392.4s)]
*  being a dictator. And so that gives a permission structure for a bunch of Republicans who feel [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=399.6s)]
*  lied to, to show up to these events and really now consider whether or not they can continue [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=404.48s)]
*  to support Donald Trump and the people who are enabling him. Listen, this latest threat to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=410.32000000000005s)]
*  suspend habeas corpus, I do not think it would ever stand up in a court of law. The president [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  only has the ability to do that in a war. I think what they're trying to do is bully the courts on [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=420.16s)]
*  a number of other cases that are pending and essentially to try to threaten judges into doing [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=427.44s)]
*  the bidding of the White House. I don't think it's going to work. I also think it's likely [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=434.64s)]
*  another attempt to try to distract everybody, their opposition, the public, the news media, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=440.4s)]
*  from the kind of key underlying story, which is this attempt to throw people off their health [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=446.08s)]
*  care in order to pass along another tax cut for billionaires. So I don't take it too seriously, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=450.4s)]
*  but we got to continue to tell the stories that are most relevant to people right now. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=456.56s)]
*  Well, let's keep talking about tax cuts to help the billionaire friends because right now [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=461.36s)]
*  y'all are in the middle of the reconciliation process, or I should say more specifically, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=467.52s)]
*  Republicans are in the process of trying to get their reconciliation bills done. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=472.08s)]
*  And there's a letter from the GOP Republican budget hardliners to Speaker Johnson. I pulled [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=477.04s)]
*  this particular quote out. The reconciliation bill must include at least $2 trillion in [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=483.2s)]
*  verifiable savings, either through spending reductions or scaling back the size of the tax [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  package. Congressman Frost, this is happening in your chamber in the House. Do you think [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=494.4s)]
*  that the speaker is in the middle of a war he's going to lose? Meaning, is he even going to get [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=501.52s)]
*  these reconciliation bills passed? And will he be able to do so before we hit the X date of raising [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=510.4s)]
*  the debt ceiling, which the treasury secretary announced this week will hit sometime mid July? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=517.76s)]
*  Every day that goes by, it is not looking likely. And I mean, who knows what's going to happen? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=526.16s)]
*  You know, the guy might not have his job at the end of this whole thing because he has all these [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=530.8s)]
*  different factions of his party. He's not been a, he's not a unifying figure for the party when, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=534.48s)]
*  you know, when it actually comes down to the wire. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2Y3zae7GY&t=539.76s)]
