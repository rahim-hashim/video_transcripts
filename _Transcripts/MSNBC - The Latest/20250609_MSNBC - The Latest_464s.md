# ‘Scared to hell’: Americans with disabilities fear possible Medicaid cuts
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk)
*  Welcome back. As Republicans work to enact the president's massive spending bill, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=0.0s)]
*  proposed cuts to Medicaid are creating a deep sense of fear among 15 million [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Americans with disabilities who rely on that program. For individuals with Down [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=9.16s)]
*  Syndrome, Medicaid is their primary form of insurance, covering everything from [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=13.6s)]
*  personal care to assistive technology. Joining me now, Audrey Presby and Jeremy [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=17.28s)]
*  Frazier, hosts of the Audrey and Jeremy show, a podcast filled as two adults with [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=22.36s)]
*  Down Syndrome having conversations with world changers. Also with us, the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=26.24s)]
*  president and CEO of the National Down Syndrome Society, Candy Pickard. Audrey, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=30.2s)]
*  I want to ask you first, I was listening to this podcast and part of what you [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=34.96s)]
*  said in this larger conversation is, I have a full life and I want to live it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=38.64s)]
*  So how could cuts to Medicaid impact you and the quality of life that you have [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=43.12s)]
*  right now? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  That's a really good question. I have rheumatoid arthritis. I was born, I was, I [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=48.88s)]
*  was four years old when I first got diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. So [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  with the cuts to Medicaid, it will affect me so much medically. I do these [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=65.2s)]
*  muscle effusions to keep my arthritis to move a lot. If I don't get that effusions, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=74.88s)]
*  I won't be able to move my body. I have arthritis from my head to my toes. So [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=85.44s)]
*  like every part of my body, and it would, and if I don't get the medication that's [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=93.8s)]
*  helping me right now, my, all of my bendy parts of my bodies will get like puffed up [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=101.08s)]
*  in a lot of pain. It will get stiff. I can't physically move them. And I will be [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=109.16s)]
*  in a wheelchair at home, not moving my body, trying to ask for help, like to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=116.32s)]
*  carry me to places that I really don't need to happen. And I, I honestly do not [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=127.8s)]
*  want to be in that situation. So hopefully they don't cut it. So I won't [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=133.92s)]
*  have to live that moment again. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=141.48s)]
*  Yeah, it would directly impact your ability to have independence. And [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=143.24s)]
*  Jeremy, what is the state of not knowing feel like for you? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=147.44s)]
*  It is depressing that they are doing it. And like, seeing this, honestly, it's my, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=151.16s)]
*  my life and other other's lives. And people with Down syndrome, I have is [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  basically a self self determination program that helps me be more independent. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  And more my goals too. And I have jobs that I have. And I got people like with [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  my support staff to have transportation to give me two jobs. It's, it's getting [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=187.36s)]
*  myself more out there and be more independent. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  It's the independence, but candy, how could work requirements or other [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  barriers to Medicaid impact individuals with Down syndrome, at least as the bill [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=204.48s)]
*  is written right now? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=209.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question, Ali. And I think NDSS remains concerned that these [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=210.64s)]
*  drastic cuts and changes to Medicaid are going to pressure states into making [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=215.96s)]
*  these difficult decisions about Medicaid programs. And history shows that when [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=219.88s)]
*  budget and resources are tight, optional programs, such as these home and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=224.24s)]
*  community based services are the first to be cut. And the specific proposals [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=228.2s)]
*  we're concerned about, as you mentioned, one of them being Medicaid work [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=233.32000000000002s)]
*  requirements. The other two are changes to state provider taxes and then the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=236.16s)]
*  reduction in retroactive coverage as well. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=240.72s)]
*  Audrey, you talked about how you could lose independence because of the way that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=244.28s)]
*  you get your rheumatoid arthritis treatment if these cuts to Medicaid [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=248.56s)]
*  happened. But those cuts wouldn't just impact you. Can you talk about what it [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=252.24s)]
*  would mean for your family? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=256.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah, of course, with my family, because they're also part of my support [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=258.24s)]
*  team. They weren't able to take me to to like work to my job, to my community, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=265.32s)]
*  to like my community events. And all of that when they helped me a lot, they [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=278.76s)]
*  were like, feel like I feel so bad for my sister or for my daughter that I'm [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=292.36s)]
*  afraid that she's not going to have the chance to live her life. And I honestly [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=300.52s)]
*  do not want them to think that way. That, yes, I do have downs to them, too. I [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=307.0s)]
*  love having a disability that makes me unique. With my family help and support, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=314.6s)]
*  they help me how to like be a person, show emotions, be part of the action. So [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=321.68s)]
*  without my family, I'm basically nothing. So I'm very happy that they are part of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=333.88s)]
*  my life and supporting me, even though it's hard to talk about Medicaid for [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=340.96s)]
*  people like me and Jeremy and for other people and their families. I don't really [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  know about their family, but I do know this topic is something that everybody's [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=353.44s)]
*  going through right now. Yeah, there's a lot of people who are scared right now. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=360.24s)]
*  They echo what you said on your podcast, Jeremy. So if you could say something to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=368.72s)]
*  members of Congress who are considering voting for this, what would you want [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  them to know? To be honest, I joined the podcast that day when I mentioned I was [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=376.56s)]
*  scared to hell because honestly it was hard to, I know Medicaid is a big word [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=388.72s)]
*  for everyone and it's important for people like us and everyone with [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=396.88s)]
*  disabilities have the rights to have the tools and resources to find what they [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  want in their lives. So my family is here to help me. If they were cutting it, I [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=412.4s)]
*  would not be here today. I think it's clear that all of you rely so much on [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=422.79999999999995s)]
*  your communities and you really enjoy your independence. I think everyone can [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=427.84s)]
*  relate to that. So as lawmakers consider this bill, I hope that they hear your [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=432.52s)]
*  story. I hope that they listen to your podcast. Audrey, Jeremy and Candy, thank [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=436.44s)]
*  you for coming on and sharing your story and your experience with us. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s7kXQ_Vfk&t=441.04s)]
