# 'Victory for our Constitution and due process’: Sen. Van Hollen on Kilmar Abrego Garcia
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=0.0s)]
*  Kilmer Abrego-Garcia is back in the U.S. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=1.0s)]
*  months after being erroneously deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=4.0s)]
*  But now he's facing new federal charges. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=9.0s)]
*  This Friday, Abrego-Garcia is scheduled for an arraignment and detention hearing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=12.0s)]
*  He's now facing charges of human smuggling of undocumented migrants, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=16.0s)]
*  in addition to being accused of being a member of the MS-13 gang. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=21.0s)]
*  This coming after months of a legal and political battle over his deportation and right to due process. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=25.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=32.0s)]
*  And Senator, appreciate you joining us. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=35.0s)]
*  You met with Abrego-Garcia in El Salvador. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=38.0s)]
*  That was back in April, so almost two months ago now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=40.0s)]
*  What's your reaction to him finally being brought back in the U.S. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=42.0s)]
*  and he's having an opportunity to receive due process, but also hit with these new federal charges? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=46.0s)]
*  So, Ana, it's good to be with you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=53.0s)]
*  Bringing him back to the United States and having him, his case process in a court of law is a victory for our Constitution, our Constitution and due process. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=56.0s)]
*  I mean, remember, President Trump and the Trump administration said that he would never set foot in the United States again. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=66.0s)]
*  I have said from the beginning that this case is not about this particular individual, Abrego-Garcia. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=74.0s)]
*  It's about his constitutional rights. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=81.0s)]
*  And if the Trump administration can trample over his rights, they can trample over the rights of anybody who lives in the United States of America. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=83.0s)]
*  So he's now in the court in Tennessee. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=92.0s)]
*  He finally has access to his lawyers and he will have access to due process. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=95.0s)]
*  That is what I have been fighting for and many have been fighting for from the beginning. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=101.0s)]
*  The federal government is now accusing Abrego-Garcia of human smuggling, alleging he helped to move undocumented migrants for nine years, including members of the MS-13 gang. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=106.0s)]
*  The administration previously accused him of being part of that gang without putting forth concrete evidence, and he is denied it, claiming he fled El Salvador because of gang violence. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=118.0s)]
*  But these human smuggling allegations, they weren't mentioned previously when he was still being held in El Salvador. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=127.0s)]
*  So I'm just wondering how you see the evidence against him and what you make of these allegations coming out now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=134.0s)]
*  Well, Ana, as you say, these are new charges. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=143.0s)]
*  They had not been brought against him previously. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=147.0s)]
*  When the Trump administration made these claims on social media that he'd been a member of MS-13, the federal district court judge in Maryland, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=150.0s)]
*  Judge Zinnis said that the administration had presented no evidence linking him to MS-13 or any terrorist activity. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=162.0s)]
*  My point all along is that these are issues that should be decided in a court of law, not statements made on social media. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=171.0s)]
*  So, look, the administration has brought these new charges. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=180.0s)]
*  We do know that one of the senior prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Tennessee quit his job. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=184.0s)]
*  We believe it's in protest about bringing this particular prosecution. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=193.0s)]
*  But the short answer is I'm going to leave that question to the prosecutors and to the lawyers. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=200.0s)]
*  Now, finally, Greg O. Garcia has access to his lawyers. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=207.0s)]
*  He finally had a chance to talk to his wife. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=211.0s)]
*  So bringing him back is what we had been fighting for again in order to make sure we secure his constitutional right to due process. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=215.0s)]
*  I'm sure you know you've been singled out. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=226.0s)]
*  Your name has come up specifically since Abrego Garcia's return. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=228.0s)]
*  President Trump calling you a total loser. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=231.0s)]
*  His words. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=234.0s)]
*  This was in his interview with Kristen Welker over the weekend. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=235.0s)]
*  Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called you a fool on social media. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=238.0s)]
*  And then take a listen to Trump orders our Tom Homan. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=242.0s)]
*  Ben Howland's an embarrassment to the halls of Congress. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=245.0s)]
*  He went over and coddled them as 13 gang member. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=250.0s)]
*  A designated terrorist. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=253.0s)]
*  A wife beater. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=257.0s)]
*  And a public safety threat. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=259.0s)]
*  And as you continue to do the investigation, I'm now a human trafficker. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=262.0s)]
*  Who trafficked not just guns and weapons, but people trafficking of women and children. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=267.0s)]
*  So he's going to pay. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=271.0s)]
*  We're going to prosecute. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=273.0s)]
*  Senator, what's your response to those names that they called you? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=275.0s)]
*  And do you have any regrets at all about meeting with Abrego Garcia? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=281.0s)]
*  Oh, I have no regret, Anna, about defending the Constitution of the United States. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=285.0s)]
*  And those statements come from individuals who have no respect for due process or the Constitution of the United States. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=291.0s)]
*  The president and his cronies have shown time and again that they're willing to ignore and sacrifice people's constitutional rights to impose their political views on the country. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=297.0s)]
*  They're doing this across the board. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=307.0s)]
*  They're abusing their power by bringing these lawsuits against universities and colleges, cracking down on first-rate education. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=309.0s)]
*  So what we have is a lawless president and a lawless administration. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=313.0s)]
*  And now finally, we have Abrego Garcia able to be in a court of law, which is all that I have asked for from the beginning. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=317.0s)]
*  And we have an administration, and you just heard from them. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=325.0s)]
*  They said they weren't going to be able to do that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=329.0s)]
*  They said they were going to be able to do it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=331.0s)]
*  And they're going to be able to do it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=333.0s)]
*  And they're going to be able to do it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=335.0s)]
*  And they're going to be able to do it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=337.0s)]
*  They said they weren't going to bring him back to allow him to have due process. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=339.0s)]
*  They've had to do that in response to the court's decision and nine to zero Supreme Court decision. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=345.0s)]
*  We don't see those very often. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=351.0s)]
*  So I am always glad to stand up for people's constitutional rights. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=353.0s)]
*  And that's what we're doing in this case. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=359.0s)]
*  Let's turn to what's happening in California now and the clashes between police and protesters after ICE raids in that area. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=361.0s)]
*  The president has called people taking to the streets insurrectionists and deployed the National Guard. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=367.0s)]
*  Do you think that was an appropriate response by the president? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=373.0s)]
*  I do not think so. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=377.0s)]
*  I think the president should allow local and state law enforcement to do their job to protect public safety. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=379.0s)]
*  People have a right to vote. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=385.0s)]
*  People have a right to protest. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=387.0s)]
*  People cannot use violence. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=389.0s)]
*  And anyone who is engaged in violence should be held accountable. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=391.0s)]
*  But that's what the president has done is thrown gasoline on a fire. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=395.0s)]
*  He is enjoying the political spectacle for his own political purposes. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=399.0s)]
*  But as Governor Newsom and others have said, state and law enforcement is not going to be able to do that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=405.0s)]
*  We are just reporting with our reporter in Washington, Yamiche Alcindor, that the administration is looking at potentially more raids and saying there could be more scenes like we're seeing in L.A. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=413.0s)]
*  and that area around the country. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=423.0s)]
*  How fearful is that? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=425.0s)]
*  I think that's a very important question. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=427.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very important question. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcbNSHoThlk&t=429.0s)]
