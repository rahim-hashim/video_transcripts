# 'Our democracy is under siege': Reaction to Trump saying U.S. is having 'judge problems'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo)
*  So, Eddie, the president says all of this, including there seems to be quite a bit of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=0.0s)]
*  laughter when they talk about judge problems, which might include defying judicial orders. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=5.2s)]
*  And then he says, we've just gotten started. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=10.64s)]
*  You haven't seen anything yet. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  What does that mean for the country going forward? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=16.18s)]
*  It means that we stand on the precipice, Chris. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=20.04s)]
*  I mean, our democracy is—and we're not being hyperbolic here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=22.16s)]
*  Our democracy is under threat. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=25.96s)]
*  More importantly, it's under siege. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=28.46s)]
*  Donald Trump has just expressed very clearly his unitary theory of executive power, that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=30.66s)]
*  he has a view of the imperial presidency that runs roughshod over the separation of powers. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=35.86s)]
*  He doesn't care about three equal branches of government. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=41.38s)]
*  We are presently—and there's no hyperbole here again—we are presently in a constitutional [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=45.14s)]
*  crisis. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=50.66s)]
*  The question is, will the American people allow it? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=51.66s)]
*  And so when he says he's going to barrel forward, that means he's going to continue [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=55.42s)]
*  to exercise executive power without constraint. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=58.6s)]
*  And that means, to be honest, Chris, our democracy is in real peril at this point. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  Let me give you an example of what has a lot of people concerned, Congressman. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=68.6s)]
*  Last night, the president made a pretty startling announcement about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=72.18s)]
*  the man deported to El Salvador. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Let me play for you exactly what he said. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=78.82000000000001s)]
*  The order from the Supreme Court stands, sir. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=82.62s)]
*  You could get him back. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=84.62s)]
*  There's a phone on this desk. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=87.46000000000001s)]
*  I could. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=88.78s)]
*  You could pick it up, and with all the power of the presidency, you could call up the president [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=89.78s)]
*  of El Salvador and say, send him back right now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=92.94s)]
*  And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=95.22s)]
*  Not only does that contradict his own team—they've claimed that he is essentially powerless, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  that they were waiting for the president of El Salvador to do something—but it also [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=105.78s)]
*  makes it clear he has no intention of following a Supreme Court order to facilitate the release. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=111.22s)]
*  So now what? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=117.22s)]
*  Well, they're quibbling over the definition of the word facilitate. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=118.22s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=123.02s)]
*  To listen to the attorney general, she said they would facilitate a plane ride for this [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=124.68s)]
*  guy back. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=129.9s)]
*  But apparently, the president is not going to call the president of the United States, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=130.9s)]
*  he's not going to call the president of El Salvador to demand that this person be put [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=135.98s)]
*  on the plane and sent home. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=140.78s)]
*  That's the problem right now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=143.22s)]
*  I mean, like, Eddie says we're in a constitutional crisis. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=144.62s)]
*  I don't know if we're there yet, but we're approaching one. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=147.3s)]
*  And candidly, on the political side of this, Donald Trump would like nothing more than [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=151.1s)]
*  all day every day to talk about this issue. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=156.1s)]
*  He feels like he's winning every time he's talking about immigration and illegal immigrants. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=158.3s)]
*  It distracts from the economic message that is really causing him enormous problems right [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=163.0s)]
*  now. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=168.34s)]
*  But right now, the president is not facilitating the return of this individual. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=169.5s)]
*  And I suspect the Supreme Court is going to have to step in again and offer further guidance [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=174.1s)]
*  as to how this man should be returned. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=180.06s)]
*  Yeah, Kilmer, Rodrigo Garcia, Eddie, is one example. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=182.06s)]
*  Last night, though, the president again called undocumented immigrants as a group, monsters [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=186.1s)]
*  that are raping and slaughtering Americans and trying to destroy our country. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=192.94s)]
*  Of course, that's despite actual data that shows undocumented immigrants commit violent [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=197.74s)]
*  crime at a much lower rate than U.S. citizens. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=202.22s)]
*  Trump also played at that rally a highly produced video of detainees being sent to El Salvador. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=206.86s)]
*  That's become familiar to most of us. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=212.66s)]
*  But it was accompanied with a soundtrack, and I want to play that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=215.3s)]
*  The reaction to that, as you can see, cheers and chants of USA is the message that they're [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=227.74s)]
*  sending with that video law and order or Eddie, is it something else? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=249.5s)]
*  Chris, law and order has always carried with it an ugly underbelly as a phrase. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=255.54s)]
*  This is hearkening back to the 1920s. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=267.41999999999996s)]
*  Remember the Johnson Reed Immigration Act was basically written by the KKK. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=272.38s)]
*  There is a deep nativist and racist undertow to what we're seeing and what we're hearing. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=277.64s)]
*  The facts do not matter. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=283.62s)]
*  There is a kind of a replay of the 100 percent Americanism that defined the 20s and the 30s. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=286.1s)]
*  We need to understand that for what it is. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=296.26s)]
*  We can give them data all day long, Chris. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=299.02s)]
*  It doesn't matter because something more visceral, something uglier, something dare I say evil [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=301.54s)]
*  is animating this. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=308.06s)]
*  Unless we name it as such, we will find ourselves complicit with horrors. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=310.18s)]
*  That's just I just I'm speechless in some ways. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=315.3s)]
*  Well, Congressman, the president also didn't hold back when asked about going after his [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  political enemies. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=324.66s)]
*  And here's what he said about that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=325.90000000000003s)]
*  You are the president now. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=329.06s)]
*  I'm asking the justification for going after people you don't like. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=330.5s)]
*  No, no, people that I think are dishonest. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=334.94s)]
*  It's not that I don't even know most of them. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=338.26000000000005s)]
*  They're people that I think these people make you angry. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=340.86s)]
*  It's not anger. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=343.94000000000005s)]
*  These are people that I think are very dishonest. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=345.66s)]
*  So you know, I mentioned at the top the quiet part out loud. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=348.86s)]
*  This is at the heart of everything, his willingness to unleash the power of his presidency on [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=352.76000000000005s)]
*  anyone he chooses for simply being, in his opinion, dishonest. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=358.34000000000003s)]
*  How has that threat changed the way do you think that the federal government and frankly [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=363.86s)]
*  everybody in the wake of Donald Trump operates these first 100 days? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=370.14s)]
*  Well, to say that he's not going after people is ridiculous. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=375.82s)]
*  I mean, he issued an executive order a couple of weeks ago urging Chris Krebs, who worked [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=378.94s)]
*  for Donald Trump in the Homeland Security Department running CESA, Cybersecurity Infrastructure [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=386.58000000000004s)]
*  Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who worked in the Homeland Security Department. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=390.64s)]
*  He's urging that they be investigated. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=393.91999999999996s)]
*  In the case of Chris Krebs, you know what his crime was? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=397.12s)]
*  He said that the election after the 2020 election, he said it was the most safe and secure election [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=400.56s)]
*  in American history. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  He was fired by tweet abruptly afterwards. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=406.44s)]
*  That's why they're going after him. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=409.32s)]
*  It's having a chilling effect. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=412.0s)]
*  He's clearly using the office of the presidency to pressure, in this case, the FBI, the Justice [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=414.91999999999996s)]
*  Department to go after a person he considers a political enemy who's not even being, who's [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=419.84s)]
*  committed no crime. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  He just did his job. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=427.47999999999996s)]
*  So this is having, I think, an enormously chilling effect. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=429.47999999999996s)]
*  Look at these law firms and universities. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=432.44s)]
*  So many of them are scared to death and they're being forced to negotiate with this administration [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=435.35999999999996s)]
*  out of fear that they're going to be cut off. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  And who knows who else he's going to go after going forward. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=443.88s)]
*  This is new territory for all of us. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=448.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  And in light of that, Eddie, let me ask you a question. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=452.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm guessing you may have gotten it, but I certainly get it a lot from people who are [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=453.96s)]
*  very concerned about what they're seeing. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=457.64s)]
*  And the question is, can we count on the Supreme Court to protect us? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=459.79999999999995s)]
*  What's the answer to that, do you imagine? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=466.56s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=469.79999999999995s)]
*  You know, John Roberts is reportedly an institutionalist. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=471.64s)]
*  I get this question all the time too, Chris. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=474.88s)]
*  He's an institutionalist, as we've described him over these years. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=477.16s)]
*  But we see a fundamental challenge to the institution of the Supreme Court. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=481.6s)]
*  We see a fundamental direct attack on the court system as such. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=486.64000000000004s)]
*  Up to this point, the courts have played an important role, but we know that it's slow, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=491.48s)]
*  it's deliberate, it's going to take time. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  But in the meantime, we've seen what they can do in 100 days. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=498.40000000000003s)]
*  We can see what they can do in 100 days. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=502.16s)]
*  So the Supreme Court cannot save us, although it will play an important role. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=503.88s)]
*  We're going to have to save us. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=510.0s)]
*  And the question is, well, do we have the strength and the imagination to do so? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=512.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's, I guess, my question, Eddie, where that goes. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=515.6s)]
*  Because as you look at the polls, there is a clear indication that it's not just that [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=519.08s)]
*  more and more American voters who are taking part in these polls are unhappy with the economy, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=524.36s)]
*  that they're unhappy with maybe the lengths to which some of the immigration movements [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=532.32s)]
*  have gone. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=539.7600000000001s)]
*  They seem to be concerned about what's happening in the country at large. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=541.5200000000001s)]
*  But what do they do with that? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=546.88s)]
*  What does history tell us that any one person can do? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=548.96s)]
*  Because I think implicit and sometimes explicit, when I get the question that you get as well, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=553.0s)]
*  it's like, I feel helpless. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=559.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=561.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, I get this a lot, too. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=562.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, we're not helpless. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=564.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think, of course, there are elections, the midterms are coming, but that's not the [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=565.4000000000001s)]
*  only thing we can do. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=568.84s)]
*  David Brooks, the conservative columnist for The New York Times, has written about this. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=570.84s)]
*  We saw what Governor Pritzker had just said recently a couple of days ago. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=575.12s)]
*  Americans are going to have to mobilize and organize to push back if we're going to defend [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=578.84s)]
*  our democracy. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=582.22s)]
*  And that may involve something as dramatic, Chris, as a general strike, something to call [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=583.58s)]
*  attention to, in some ways, halt what these folk are doing. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=588.64s)]
*  They're literally dismantling government right in front of our eyes. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=592.68s)]
*  They're literally absorbing power, in some ways exercising executive power without constraint. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=596.8s)]
*  And so we're going to have to respond at the scale in which the attack on the democracy [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=603.5999999999999s)]
*  is taking place. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=608.68s)]
*  And so I keep telling people, we have to do it at the local level, we have to do it at [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  the state level, and we have to do it at the national level, but we have to organize a [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=613.56s)]
*  response that is actually consonant with what we're experiencing. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=617.4s)]
*  And that may very well involve a major, massive action on the part of the American people. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=621.52s)]
*  We may need, no matter our ideological orientations, to take to the streets, it seems to me. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=628.44s)]
*  Eddie Cloud, former Congressman Charlie Dent, as again this meeting of the cabinet continues. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=634.24s)]
*  We'll continue to listen in. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=642.64s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=643.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9HGeh0zXo&t=647.24s)]
