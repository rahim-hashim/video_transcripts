# 'I regret some of my posts': Musk says he 'went too far' in bashing Trump
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA)
*  It's a rare mea culpa from the world's richest man. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk says he now regrets some of the social media posts he made about President [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=3.04s)]
*  Trump last week. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  Posting on X earlier this morning, quote, they went too far. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=8.56s)]
*  Now it's not clear which post he was referring to specifically, although in one he endorsed [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=11.42s)]
*  the idea of Trump's impeachment and in another linked him to the Jeffrey Epstein files. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=15.76s)]
*  Here's President Trump talking today on the feud with his former right-hand man. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=20.64s)]
*  What happened with Elon? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Is there anything that you can do to forgive him? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=27.5s)]
*  Could you see that happening? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=31.42s)]
*  Well, look, I have no hard feelings. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=32.42s)]
*  I was really surprised that that happened. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=35.26s)]
*  He went after Bill. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=39.74s)]
*  That's phenomenal. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=40.74s)]
*  When he did that, I was not a happy camper. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=41.74s)]
*  So it's too bad. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=44.1s)]
*  NBC's Garrett Haake is at the White House. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=46.78s)]
*  Peter Baker is also back with us. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=49.1s)]
*  Garrett, what else are you hearing from President Trump? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  Is there room for the reconciliation? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  This is banned, getting back together. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=55.14s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=57.1s)]
*  I think to a certain degree, Christina, it's likely that there will be some kind of reconciliation, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=58.1s)]
*  especially as we're just learning NBC News has just confirmed with two sources familiar [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  that the president's really two top aides, his chief of staff and his vice president [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=66.5s)]
*  spoke with Elon Musk late last week and urged this reproachment that we saw in the form [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=72.0s)]
*  of that overnight apology, such as it was from Elon Musk and other social media activity [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=77.3s)]
*  we saw from Elon Musk over the weekend, basically cheering on the administration's approach [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=82.38s)]
*  to the situation in Los Angeles. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=86.84s)]
*  All of it suggests that at least one half of this split is moving back towards the other [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=89.12s)]
*  here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  The president himself has also kind of lowered the temperature in some of his remarks about [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  Listen to the way he's been talking about it recently. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  The bill is so good when he went after the bill. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=105.12s)]
*  This bill is going to turn around this country so fast your head will spin. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  Now, I think a bill is great. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  And he just didn't think that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=113.12s)]
*  I think he feels very badly that he said that, actually. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  Could you reconcile with him? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  Do you think? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  Could you forgive him? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  I guess I could. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  What I think we might be headed towards here, Christina, is something more like the Steve [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  Bannon model, where you have another top adviser to the president, someone almost inseparable [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=125.48s)]
*  from him for a period of time, who had a falling out, was kind of on the outside for a while [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=129.84s)]
*  and now is back, if not in the inner circle, but kind of orbiting President Trump. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=134.16s)]
*  I could imagine a scenario in which we see a similar future for Elon Musk. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  But a total rekindling of their relationship, I think, is unlikely, at least while Musk's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=143.12s)]
*  opposition to the president's signature piece of legislation is still out there. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=149.39999999999998s)]
*  And Peter, I mean, you heard Garrett just talking about this new reporting that this [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=156.12s)]
*  apology came after Vice President Vance and she's staff Susie Wiles reached out to Musk [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=158.88s)]
*  and urged him to do so. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=164.04s)]
*  But we've also talked about who has the most to lose in this relationship. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=165.66s)]
*  And it seems to be that perhaps it was Musk. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=170.1s)]
*  Was there just too big of a risk for him to allow this rift to continue? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=172.62s)]
*  Well, look, the president made very clear he was willing to use the power of his office [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=176.74s)]
*  to punish Elon Musk, who has billions of dollars worth of federal contracts. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=181.3s)]
*  Trump very openly said, maybe we should cut these contracts and save the billions of dollars [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=187.38s)]
*  in money. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=191.42s)]
*  The federal government regulates Elon Musk's businesses. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=192.78s)]
*  In fact, he had, I think, I forgot the number, more than a dozen different regulatory disputes [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=195.58s)]
*  or lawsuits with the federal government before Trump came in office. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=200.78s)]
*  Some of those have been kind of pulled back under Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=204.34s)]
*  They could be revived or more could be pursued. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=208.3s)]
*  And so I think that, you know, Trump has made clear, unlike other presidents, that he doesn't [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=213.82s)]
*  about using the power of his office to, you know, to carry out his desires or reward friends [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=218.46s)]
*  and punish enemies. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=225.66s)]
*  So Elon Musk has a lot at stake here. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=226.66s)]
*  His businesses have already taken a hit because of his association with Donald Trump. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=229.3s)]
*  Tesla stock plummeted over the last few months. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=233.10000000000002s)]
*  It went back up a little bit, I think, after this apology, because I think his shareholders [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  are eager for there to be kind of a rapprochement. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  They want to avoid the open conflict in which, you know, Trump, who says he likes the word [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=243.54s)]
*  retribution, you know, could find ways to exact it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=249.94s)]
*  That's exactly it, because, I mean, we heard the president just say he guesses he could [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=255.14s)]
*  forgive Musk. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=258.21999999999997s)]
*  But this is not this president's favorite thing to do. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=259.46s)]
*  Do you see these two working together in the future in a way that they have in the past? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=262.74s)]
*  Or will it be different? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=266.74s)]
*  I think Gareth's got it right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=267.74s)]
*  I have a hard time seeing the two of them ever getting back together in quite the same [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=269.94s)]
*  way that they were in those 130 days after the inauguration, in which they are seemingly [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=273.58s)]
*  inseparable and which Musk basically seemed to be the prime minister under, you know, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=278.1s)]
*  Trump's presidency. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  But having said that, this isn't, they're both mercurial individuals. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  They don't, you know, stick closely to a certain path. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=287.5s)]
*  They have a way of getting in and out of relationships and then coming back around to them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=291.54s)]
*  Remember, the president's own vice president once compared him to Adolf Hitler. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=295.94s)]
*  And yet he named JD Vance to be his running mate. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=299.54s)]
*  The president's secretary of state once, you know, mocked President Trump's private parts. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=302.7s)]
*  And yet he's now the highest officer in the cabinet. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=308.18s)]
*  So President Trump has a way of bringing people back into the fold. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=311.1s)]
*  He may not forgive, he may not forget, but he does sort of, you know, bring people in [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=314.66s)]
*  and out again, depending on how things go and how much they tend to, you know, flatter [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=319.14s)]
*  him and play to his ego. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=324.66s)]
*  All right, we're going to have to leave it there for now. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=328.18s)]
*  Peter, stick around. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=329.82000000000005s)]
*  Garrett Haig, thank you so much. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnaFIIeRvA&t=330.82000000000005s)]
