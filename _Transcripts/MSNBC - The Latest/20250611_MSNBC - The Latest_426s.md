# Trump ‘trying to turn the U.S. military into his personal police force’: Rep. Smith
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8)
*  Welcome back. Just moments ago, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was pressed by Senator Jack Reid about the military deployment in Los Angeles. Let's listen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, Senator, we very much support President Trump's focus on defending the homeland on our southern border, as well as supporting law enforcement officials doing their job in ICE in Los Angeles, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=9.0s)]
*  who deserve not to be assaulted, accosted and rioted while rounding up one of the 21 million illegals allowed in as an invasion under the previous administration. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=26.0s)]
*  Are you prepared to authorize DHS to use drones and also to authorize the forces to detain or arrest American citizens? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=35.0s)]
*  Senator, every authorization we've provided the National Guard and the Marines in Los Angeles is under the authority of the President of the United States, is lawful and constitutional. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=44.0s)]
*  They are assisting in defending law enforcement officers and law enforcement facilities in the execution of their job in the city of Los Angeles. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=54.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Adam Smith. He is the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee in the House. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=68.0s)]
*  Again, that was a back and forth that just happened in this Senate hearing, Congressman. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=75.0s)]
*  And the Secretary of Defense did not answer that question directly when asked if this administration could authorize the use of drones or authorize military arresting American citizens. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=81.0s)]
*  What's your reaction to what we just heard? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=98.0s)]
*  Well, look, I think what the President is doing in Los Angeles is very problematic and unnecessary. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=100.0s)]
*  The calling in of the Guard or any federal forces is only necessary if local law enforcement cannot handle the situation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=106.0s)]
*  The LAPD showed up immediately and was, in fact, defending ICE and protecting them from all the things that Secretary Hague-South just said. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=113.0s)]
*  So there was no necessity. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=121.0s)]
*  And under the law, the only time that the active duty military or the Guard and Reserve can show up is to prevent a rebellion or an invasion. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=122.0s)]
*  Neither one of those things were present. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=133.0s)]
*  And the other big piece of this and what Senator Reid was trying to get at is the Posse Combatatus law makes it clear that U.S. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=135.0s)]
*  military cannot be engaged in domestic law enforcement, except if the President invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=142.0s)]
*  So that's what Senator Reid was getting at. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=149.0s)]
*  But look, the big point here is President Trump is trying to turn the United States military into his personal police force. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=151.0s)]
*  There was no need for this in Los Angeles. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=158.0s)]
*  The President's trying to set a precedent, again, as he has in so many other areas, to expand his executive power at the expense of the law and at the expense of the Constitution. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=161.0s)]
*  How big of a threat is that, using his personal police force, turning the military into his personal police force, as you have said? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=171.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's pretty big. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=178.0s)]
*  I mean, if he can call them out for I think it was a couple hundred protesters originally when this whole thing started and ICE was not stopped from doing their job. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=181.0s)]
*  They were arresting and deporting people. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=191.0s)]
*  They were in no way stopped from performing their duties. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=193.0s)]
*  If the President can call and keep in mind, four thousand Guard and Reserve members and seven hundred Marines. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=196.0s)]
*  He sent forty seven hundred U.S. troops into Los Angeles for a couple hundred protesters that were already being dealt with by the Los Angeles Police Department. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=202.0s)]
*  Now, look, I fully agree with the fact our border should be secure. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=212.0s)]
*  Our laws and our city should be enforced. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=216.0s)]
*  And I don't think a number of cities across the country did a great job of that in the last five or six years. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=218.0s)]
*  But that's not what this is about. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=223.0s)]
*  The president is using this power to expand his authority, to expand his executive power again at the expense of the law and expense of our freedom and our rights. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=225.0s)]
*  In an interview, House Speaker Mike Johnson was asked about the violence and the response there in Los Angeles compared to January 6th. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=234.0s)]
*  And he says, quote, There's a very clear distinction between the two people who broke the law and destroyed property on January 6th were met with the proper consequences on that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=242.0s)]
*  Congressman, is that how you see it? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=252.0s)]
*  Well, that's that's actually quite funny because the president of the United States pardoned every single one of them. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=254.0s)]
*  They were not met with any consequences under this president under the previous president. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=260.0s)]
*  They were under this president. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=264.0s)]
*  They were they were pardoned. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=266.0s)]
*  They were allowed. And that, by the way, was an actual insurrection. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=267.0s)]
*  Those forces showed up at the U.S. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=271.0s)]
*  Capitol to try to overturn the election and install their chosen precedent. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=273.0s)]
*  That is an absolute definition of insurrection. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=279.0s)]
*  A hundred or so people showing up in Los Angeles to protest the president's immigration policies. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=282.0s)]
*  Not an invasion, not an insurrection. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=288.0s)]
*  So Speaker Johnson is just laughably wrong in trying to make. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=290.0s)]
*  Well, he's right in one thing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=294.0s)]
*  There is no comparison between what happened in Los Angeles. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=296.0s)]
*  It happened on January 6th. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=298.0s)]
*  January 6th was a thousand times worse and actually warranted a federal response, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=300.0s)]
*  which President Trump at the time refused to do for hours as his supporters sacked the United States Capitol. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=306.0s)]
*  And the National Guard was not deployed in that situation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=314.0s)]
*  The Pentagon now estimates that the deployment of the National Guard and the Marines to Los Angeles will be about one hundred and thirty four million dollars. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=319.0s)]
*  A drop in the bucket when it comes to the defense budget, but one hundred and thirty four million dollars. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=329.0s)]
*  What's your reaction to that amount? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=334.0s)]
*  Look, and that's that is just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=336.0s)]
*  The president plans on using the troops for a variety of different missions. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=339.0s)]
*  What he's done at the border has cost billions. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=343.0s)]
*  In fact, he's just announced that he's taking a billion dollars out of military construction, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=346.0s)]
*  money that we set aside to actually improve and build barracks for our service members. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=350.0s)]
*  He's taking a billion dollars out of that to put more money into border security. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=355.0s)]
*  And keep in mind, as of this moment, President Trump is telling us that the border is secure. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=360.0s)]
*  And I don't really disagree with him on that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=366.0s)]
*  There have not been much in the way of border crossing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=368.0s)]
*  So why is he rating the Department of Defense to the tune of another billion dollars for a border that's already secure? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=370.0s)]
*  Again, I really want to emphasize the president is consolidating power in himself as the executive, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=378.0s)]
*  violating the law, violating the Constitution and using the United States military in a way [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=384.0s)]
*  that our country has spent two hundred plus years trying to make sure it was never used because we wanted [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=390.0s)]
*  to be a civilian run country in a free country, not one where the military shows up and arrests people on the streets of our cities. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=395.0s)]
*  Congressman Adam Smith, thank you for joining us. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=402.0s)]
*  I appreciate the conversation. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=405.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uVAbwFrX8&t=408.0s)]
