# Schumer: Trump doesn't believe in democracy
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU)
*  And joining us now, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=0.0s)]
*  It's good to see you, Senator, and we know you just met with some of your constituents [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=3.2s)]
*  talking about tariffs. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=8.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=9.36s)]
*  What did they tell you? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=9.68s)]
*  Well, I was out on Long Island at a famous dress retailer called Tandy's Works. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=11.44s)]
*  And she is a Trump voter, but she's just distraught. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=19.12s)]
*  Her costs have gone up 30 percent. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  She doesn't want to raise prices for her customers, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=25.28s)]
*  but she doesn't know how she's going to make it if these tariffs continue. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=28.48s)]
*  And she has lots of employees. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=32.0s)]
*  A lot of them voted Republican. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  I was in a Republican district, but they're just totally, totally appalled by these tariffs, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=35.68s)]
*  a, by the costs, and they realize that their own constituents, the average Long Islander, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  will pay about $5,000 more if the present tariffs stay in effect. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=45.92s)]
*  They'll have less money to go to Tandy's and buy the clothes that they like to buy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=50.24s)]
*  They pay more for everything. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  People who are retiring, their IRAs are down almost $100,000 on average, less money there. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=56.0s)]
*  And so she really doesn't understand this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=63.12s)]
*  And then the second thing which she just brought up is the chaos. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=65.36s)]
*  They say different things on different days. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=69.36s)]
*  Tandy's a businesswoman, a very successful businesswoman, a pro-Trump businesswoman, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=71.52s)]
*  I might add. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=76.08s)]
*  But she said, I can't deal with the chaos. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  Businesspeople, whether they're big businesses, medium or small, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  they're able to plot out a path forward if they know what's happening. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=84.56s)]
*  But things keep changing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=89.12s)]
*  Different people say different things. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=90.24s)]
*  So the tariffs themselves are bad and the chaos makes it even worse. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=91.84s)]
*  Which brings us to the question of what to do about it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=96.88s)]
*  You are a co-sponsor of a resolution that would rescind the president's wide-ranging tariffs. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=99.04s)]
*  But how many co-sponsors do you have? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=103.6s)]
*  And do you plan to try to force a vote on it when the Senate returns next week? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=106.32s)]
*  Yes, we have the right. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=110.0s)]
*  Senators Wyden, Kaine and I have introduced this resolution, which has, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=111.84s)]
*  we can bring it to the floor and we will. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  There will be a vote on tariffs. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  We've seen on other resolutions Republicans joined us. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  When Senator Kaine brought one up on Canada, we did get four Republicans to join us. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  That was enough to pass it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=126.72s)]
*  It only needs 51 votes. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=127.84s)]
*  Senator Cantwell has worked with Senator Grassley on a bipartisan bill [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=129.68s)]
*  that would stop all future tariffs. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=133.12s)]
*  I think there are six or seven Republicans on it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=134.88s)]
*  So Republican senators and hopefully Congress people too [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=137.44s)]
*  are feeling the heat. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=141.28s)]
*  And I think they realize that this is a disaster for them. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=142.96s)]
*  If you look at the numbers today, Donald Trump's stewardship of the economy is below 40. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=145.84s)]
*  When he got into office, it was above 50. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=151.84s)]
*  In part, that's due to the idea of cutting Medicaid and cutting Social Security [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=154.4s)]
*  and cutting Medicare and veterans benefits to pay for tax cuts for the billionaires. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  But in good part, it's also because of these tariffs. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=164.16s)]
*  People think he doesn't know what he's doing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=166.88s)]
*  And any observer who watches what he says, what his advisors say, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=168.88s)]
*  what how it changes from day to day would agree. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=172.72s)]
*  There's another big story, as you know, about your colleague today, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=177.04s)]
*  Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin announcing he will not seek reelection in 2026. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=180.16s)]
*  Number two, Democrat in the Senate. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=185.04s)]
*  Do you expect to endorse anyone for that job [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  or are you going to let your conference sort things out? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=189.92s)]
*  Well, let me say something first. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=192.4s)]
*  Dick Durbin has been a great senator, a great friend. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=193.92s)]
*  We actually lived in the same little house. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=197.2s)]
*  Four of us shared a house for 20 years. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  And his effectiveness in the Senate was tremendous. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=202.88s)]
*  The compassion he had for people. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  He did so much for the dreamers. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  Now, this thing is 18 months away. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=210.16s)]
*  You know, that's when the election will be held for Whip. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  So it's a little too early to speculate. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, let me ask you, though, because there is speculation, as you know, going on. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=217.6s)]
*  What do you think about someone like Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz in that role? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  Look, we have a lot of really, really good senators and too early to speculate. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=224.8s)]
*  Not going to not going to do that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  Minnesota senator, any Klobuchar among them? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  Too early to speculate. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  Try me again. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  You can't blame me for trying, Senator. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=237.84s)]
*  No, I can't. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=239.68s)]
*  Look, Senator Durbin was on Morning Joe this morning. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=240.8s)]
*  He gave some new insight into his decision to retire. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  And I want to play that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=246.72000000000003s)]
*  It's a personal decision to run for the Senate. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  It is two years, a two year undertaking serving in the Senate as a six year term. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=252.8s)]
*  So I looked at eight years and said, I think it's time for me to pass the torch on to another candidate. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=257.04s)]
*  But have you given any thought to to a more specific timeline when it comes to passing the torch yourself? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  Are you even giving that some thought right now? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=272.8s)]
*  Right now, I am focused on showing the American people how bad Trump's economics are for them, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=275.68s)]
*  how he is putting our democracy at risk. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=282.08s)]
*  And I am totally focused on that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  As you said, I was out on Long Island today. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=286.64s)]
*  I have visited all six Republican, six of the seven Republican congressional districts, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=288.8s)]
*  talking about tariffs, talking about the economy, talking about how bad cutting Medicaid would be, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=294.32s)]
*  particularly in our rural areas. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=301.68s)]
*  That's my focus. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=303.44s)]
*  And that's what I'm doing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, just so I'm clear, no thought, no conversation about when you might step aside. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=305.36s)]
*  I'm focusing on the decision that the Republicans in Congress have to make to whether support Trump [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=311.92s)]
*  with these horrible economic policies or not. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=320.32s)]
*  And we're doing everything we can to show the American people who's on whose side. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=322.8s)]
*  As you know, Harvard University is suing the Trump administration for freezing billions in funding [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  to the school after it rejected a list of the administration's demands. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  Is Harvard doing the right thing? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=337.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  And in fact, today, a group of Jewish senators and myself sent a letter to the administration [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=340.8s)]
*  telling them that, look, going against anti-Semitism is important. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=347.44s)]
*  But what they've done goes way beyond that. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=352.0s)]
*  Cutting money for medical research in medical schools, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=354.24s)]
*  where there's been no evidence that they've presented of any anti-Semitism there, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=357.2s)]
*  hurting people who need that kind of help, not only in the hospitals, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  but this great research that's been going on at some of our greatest universities [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=365.2s)]
*  including Harvard, they're threatening to cut it off. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=368.96s)]
*  That's because they're angry at the universities. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  Go after the specifics of anti-Semitism. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  Tell us what they are and what the reasons are. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=377.52s)]
*  That's what our letter is. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=379.44s)]
*  What are the specifics that are going on with anti-Semitism [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=380.4s)]
*  that the university isn't doing enough about? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  But don't use this chainsaw to use a Musk approach and just cut everything off. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=385.76s)]
*  It is wrong. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  It's unconstitutional. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=393.12s)]
*  They're really trying to block freedom of speech in ways that they, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=394.64s)]
*  because they don't like what some of the people in the universities may say. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=398.16s)]
*  But it also is so damaging to the future of our country and to the health of America. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=401.6s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=406.56s)]
*  And Harvard did the right thing. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=407.76000000000005s)]
*  I fully support what they're doing. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  I hope other universities will line up behind Harvard and not let the administration, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=411.20000000000005s)]
*  because they don't like the universities, bully them into some kind of submission. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, let me read what President Trump posted on Truth Social just today, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  writing in part to your point, his opinion, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=425.12s)]
*  Harvard is an anti-Semitic far left institution as are numerous others, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=428.32s)]
*  with students being accepted from all over the world that want to rip our country apart. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  Is the Trump administration operating in good faith when it uses the issue of anti-Semitism [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=438.79999999999995s)]
*  to go after the nation's elite universities? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  They are not. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=446.23999999999995s)]
*  Look, I've gone after anti-Semitism at universities. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=446.79999999999995s)]
*  So have the other signers of our letter. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  We don't like it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=451.2s)]
*  But they're not acting on good faith at all. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=452.08s)]
*  They're acting in a lawless, reckless, vicious way. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=453.92s)]
*  And it's not going to succeed. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=458.08000000000004s)]
*  I believe America will rally behind the idea that you don't cut medical research, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=459.52000000000004s)]
*  that you don't hurt—by the way, 90 percent of the students didn't participate in any [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=464.8s)]
*  demonstrations. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=469.76s)]
*  What they're doing hurts all of the students, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=470.8s)]
*  even the Jewish students who might have been hurt by anti-Semitism. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=472.8s)]
*  It is ridiculous. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=475.92s)]
*  It is not just ridiculous. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  It's very, very harmful to the future of this country and to freedom of speech in this country. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  President Trump's got to learn something. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  Not everyone's going to agree with him. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=486.32s)]
*  And he can't illegally use the power of the federal government to say, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=488.0s)]
*  we'll cut your tax status, we'll stop sending you money illegally [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=492.08000000000004s)]
*  because I don't like what you say. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=495.6s)]
*  It is so un-American. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  And no president, not a Democratic president, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=499.04s)]
*  but Ronald Reagan didn't do this, George Bush didn't do this, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=502.08000000000004s)]
*  none of the presidents except Donald Trump. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  He goes way beyond where any president should go [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=507.36s)]
*  because he doesn't really—he doesn't like democracy. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=511.20000000000005s)]
*  He doesn't like to hear anybody oppose what he does. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=513.92s)]
*  And maybe it's because people are learning that he's not on the side of the American people. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=516.8s)]
*  He's on the side of a bunch of very wealthy billionaires. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=521.8399999999999s)]
*  He wants to cut their taxes, cut Medicaid, put in these tariffs. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  Some of the reason they say is to have more tax breaks for billionaires. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=528.56s)]
*  And so he keeps trying to put up these diversionary smoke screens. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=532.64s)]
*  But the trouble is they're not just diversionary. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=538.0799999999999s)]
*  They are very damaging to this country and to the concept of this country. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=540.48s)]
*  Where we debate, we have freedom of speech, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=544.6400000000001s)]
*  but you can't use the powers of the government illegally to try to shut someone up. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=547.0400000000001s)]
*  I want to ask you about something you told my colleague Chris Hayes last month. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=555.7600000000001s)]
*  I'm quoting you here. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=558.96s)]
*  We will all have to take extraordinary action if the president doesn't obey the Supreme Court. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=560.48s)]
*  The Supreme Court said the administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=565.84s)]
*  Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=570.32s)]
*  That has not happened. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=573.84s)]
*  Are we at the point, Senator, where you feel extraordinary action is warranted? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=576.1600000000001s)]
*  Look, the case will be back to the Supreme Court. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=581.7600000000001s)]
*  They sent it down to the lower court, Judge. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=584.32s)]
*  But if the president disobeys a Supreme Court order, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=586.24s)]
*  extraordinary action will be necessary. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=589.44s)]
*  And we've never had that in the Republic before, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=591.7600000000001s)]
*  in the kind of way that the president is doing it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=594.08s)]
*  And again, he doesn't believe in democracy. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=596.1600000000001s)]
*  He doesn't believe there should be diversity of opinion. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=599.36s)]
*  He doesn't believe in due process. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=602.16s)]
*  You can't pick up someone off the streets and send them somewhere [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=604.0s)]
*  if you haven't presented evidence against them. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=606.96s)]
*  The country, the democracy is at risk. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=610.96s)]
*  What would trigger that and what would it be, Senator? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=612.88s)]
*  What would trigger it and what would that be? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=615.6s)]
*  Well, it would be, look, first, it would be if the Supreme Court makes a final decision [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=617.12s)]
*  and Trump decides to disobey it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=622.4s)]
*  And it will be on all of us, not just the political leaders, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=624.5600000000001s)]
*  but certainly us, but on all Americans to resist that. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=628.32s)]
*  And I think that would happen. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=631.6800000000001s)]
*  Public opinion means everything here. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  And when the public learns more and more about what Trump is doing, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=635.84s)]
*  whether it's on economics and tariffs to the universities [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=639.12s)]
*  or upcoming in this situation, I think the public's going to be outraged. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=642.5600000000001s)]
*  Finally, Senator, I am speaking to you today from the Vatican, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=648.48s)]
*  where Pope Francis is being warned. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=651.5200000000001s)]
*  I can look down and see people lining up to pay their respects. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=653.36s)]
*  And I know you spent time, you met the pope when he visited New York. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=656.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=660.88s)]
*  How were you remembering him? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=661.04s)]
*  He was a holy man. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=662.8s)]
*  The cardinal asked me, Cardinal Dolan, to greet him on the steps [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=665.68s)]
*  when he first arrived in New York. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=670.0799999999999s)]
*  And it was an honor for me, of course. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=672.0s)]
*  But the minute I met him, the brilliance and compassion of his soul shone through. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=674.0799999999999s)]
*  It was a unique experience to meet this man. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=680.3199999999999s)]
*  He had to be in his presence just five minutes to realize what a special person he was. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=682.88s)]
*  And the whole world will miss him. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=687.6s)]
*  His care for those who are downtrodden, his compassion, his leadership [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=689.36s)]
*  is going to be missed by all of us, whether we're Catholic or not. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=695.84s)]
*  Senator Chuck Schumer, appreciate your time, sir. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=700.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=703.12s)]
*  Nice to talk to you, Chris. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=703.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0JTZ9oYwU&t=712.72s)]
