# Trump corruption stirs impeachment talk after just 114 days
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA)
*  It was just a couple of days ago last Friday when the mayor of Newark was arrested, put [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=0.0s)]
*  in a facility for several hours. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=6.44s)]
*  There were three members of Congress who were there also. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=10.0s)]
*  First of all, what was going through your head when you were watching that? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=14.0s)]
*  I mean, utter outrage. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  I was in his position. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=17.92s)]
*  And so that institution, which is a private company, for-profit prison, occupied that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=19.64s)]
*  for 10 to 20 years without getting a fire code approval, without getting a certificate [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=26.44s)]
*  of occupancy, without health inspectors visiting. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  And they were in court with the city, and they still chose to belie the court processes [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=33.68s)]
*  and occupy that and put human beings in there with no inspections whatsoever. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=38.88s)]
*  So Roz Baraka had been going time and time again. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  And then on a visit with protesters out there, he didn't bring the protesters. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=46.36s)]
*  They started chanting, let him in. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=50.16s)]
*  So they invited him in. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=51.24s)]
*  He goes on the inside. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=52.24s)]
*  And they come out and said, you need to leave. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=53.88s)]
*  You're trespassing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  So he left. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  Then they come out after him on city property and arrest a sitting mayor in his own city. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  It's really outrageous. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=62.64s)]
*  It's completely outrageous. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=63.84s)]
*  And now this week, I mean, Congressman Carter, I'm just going to note, is a member from Georgia, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=66.2s)]
*  not even from New Jersey, although he's running for Senate. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=70.44s)]
*  He proposed trying to strip these three New Jersey Democrats from their committees. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=80.28s)]
*  I mean, this is, first of all, it's outrageous. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  And by the way, this is in the context of arresting a federal judge, of violating a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=83.55999999999999s)]
*  Supreme Court 9-0 order, attacks on due process, disappearing human beings. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  This is all part of this equation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  Those congresspeople, that's ridiculous. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=95.16s)]
*  They were invited. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=96.91999999999999s)]
*  They showed up there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=98.36s)]
*  They were brought in. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=99.36s)]
*  They were put into a room, told they were going to get a tour. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=100.36s)]
*  They came out when they saw all these massive people running out to arrest the mayor. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=102.44s)]
*  Then they were invited back in and given the tour. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=106.84s)]
*  So again, this idea that somehow they bum-rushed this area or did something, that's outrageous. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  And then number two is, again, this weaponizing the justice system in a way to intimidate [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  and try to silence leaders, be they judges who they're threatening arrest of or congresspeople. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=122.72s)]
*  This is a trampling of the separation of powers. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=128.56s)]
*  This is a president that does not want accountability, doesn't want checks and balances, doesn't [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=131.56s)]
*  want transparency. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=135.52s)]
*  And to me, this is an erosion of our constitutional, not just norms, but our sacred ideals. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=137.28s)]
*  And we should all be saying enough is enough. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  Stop the intimidation of judges, attacking judges when they rule in a way that you don't [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=146.16s)]
*  want to, with such language that you now see judges getting an uptick in threats on their [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=151.4s)]
*  lives, these pizzas that are being sent to them, in the name of another federal judge's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  murdered son, Esther Solis's family. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  That's outrageous. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  And again, you have Article 1 branch of government, the legislature, you are doing things to intimidate [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=165.4s)]
*  them, threatening to have their arrest. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  So this is stuff that is outrageous. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=174.32s)]
*  It's more indicative of an authoritarian nation, not a free democracy, where people have a [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=176.08s)]
*  right to have checks and balances, to have accountability for their president. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=181.0s)]
*  And right now we have a congress that is not only laying down, not holding any hearings [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=185.6s)]
*  for accountability, but also are complicit in the most corrupt administration that we've [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=189.92s)]
*  seen in generations with what this president is doing, as we see in the Middle East right [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=196.32s)]
*  now, with his meme coins and his crypto deals, and now the offering of this outrageous plane [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=200.72s)]
*  that you alluded to earlier, which is nothing more than a blatant in public eye bribe to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  a president. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=216.92s)]
*  And the question is asked, who is this president accountable to? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=218.56s)]
*  The people of the United States of America, or those people who are giving him millions [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=221.68s)]
*  and millions of dollars of gifts and inducements. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=225.28s)]
*  I started the show talking about how the plane is very much in our faces, but it's hard to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=229.24s)]
*  know. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=233.44s)]
*  I mean, he also has these meme coins. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=234.44s)]
*  It's hard to know what the most, the sketchiest deal with a Middle Eastern country is happening [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=235.44s)]
*  right now. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=240.0s)]
*  You do, you have called for the Senate to vote to condemn Trump's plan to accept the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=241.0s)]
*  plane. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=245.72s)]
*  But have you, have you had any, I mean, there's been a lot of Republicans who have spoken [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=247.56s)]
*  out about this, but I'm not a naive cat, neither are you. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=251.68s)]
*  No. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=254.6s)]
*  Do you expect any of them to join you in condemning this? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=255.6s)]
*  It has been over 110 days. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=257.4s)]
*  As Trump walked in, he formed, created this meme coin, which in and of itself, to me, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=260.32s)]
*  is an impeachable offense to have a president that basically says, anybody anywhere can [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=265.96s)]
*  dump money into my pocket. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=270.88s)]
*  That should have been a loan, but then he attacks all the people that can hold them [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=272.68s)]
*  accountable. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=275.8s)]
*  After expector generals, after expector general. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=277.04s)]
*  In fact, the very agencies that are investigating Elon Musk, this most wealthy man in the world, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=278.64s)]
*  unaccountable billionaire, he was now undermining their ability to investigate him. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  This administration from day one has been showing staggering levels of corruption. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=288.92s)]
*  And in many ways, this has been fueled by a Supreme Court that says, hey, you cannot, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=294.72s)]
*  anything you do while you're president, we cannot hold you criminally liable for. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=299.52s)]
*  We are with a president that is being unchecked by the Supreme Court or by the Congress, and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  now it feels like he's unchecked whatsoever to fill his pockets and the pockets of his [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=308.48s)]
*  family out broad daylight at things that no senator, no senator would ever justify this [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=312.68s)]
*  unless they were being intimidated by a president into silence. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23djXDQUILA&t=320.24s)]
