# ‘Harder than the pandemic': Business owner suing Trump admin over tariff turmoil
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg)
*  And we are joined now by one of the plaintiffs suing over Trump's tariffs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=0.0s)]
*  Rick Woldenberg is the CEO of family-owned toy company Learning Resources. Rick, thanks so much [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  for joining us. I know this is stressful for you as you're trying to navigate all the uncertainty. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=9.68s)]
*  The courts have now acknowledged that Trump's tariffs would cause your company, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=14.96s)]
*  quote, significant and unrecoverable losses. What kind of losses? What does it look like for you? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=18.88s)]
*  Well, obviously, we're doing everything we can to stem the tide of those losses. We have to pay the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=24.4s)]
*  tariffs as we bring product in. But it's the frictional costs that are really killing us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=30.96s)]
*  You know, we have the costs of moving product from one country to another, retesting services [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  related to that lost business, business opportunities that went away, orders that were canceled. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=43.84s)]
*  There's a very long list of hits we're taking, and they're not recoverable because you can't [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=50.56s)]
*  seek damages from the U.S. government. You have about 500 employees, right? Have you had to lay [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=55.6s)]
*  off anybody because of Trump's policies? No, we're absolutely drawing the line at that. We've defined [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=61.6s)]
*  this as a community problem at our company, and we're circling the wagons around our team. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=69.2s)]
*  Their families are counting on their livelihood. You say 60 percent of your product comes from [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=75.2s)]
*  China and that you're trying to pivot manufacturing elsewhere, even move production to America. Can you [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  just help us understand what kind of undertaking that is? Well, we have about 30 percent of our [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  office employees working full-time or part-time on tariffs, and that's a change up from about zero a [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  month ago. That's a massive shift in labor, almost unthinkable. No one carries that kind of spare [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=100.32s)]
*  capacity, and because the rules change every two days, like we're stuck in some sort of telenovela, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=106.55999999999999s)]
*  you don't really know what to do. We are constantly making decisions with guesses because [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=113.52s)]
*  we don't know what the rules are, and they keep changing. It sounds so frustrating. Small businesses [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  have raised a lot of alarm about the impact of these tariffs already, but the White House hasn't [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=128.0s)]
*  budged. They're saying zero exceptions, zero carve-outs for small businesses. On top of it, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=132.16s)]
*  you have the White House telling companies to eat the cost of tariffs rather than raise prices. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=136.64s)]
*  How does that hit you? It feels like gaslighting. The reality is that this tariff scheme is a $600 [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=141.28s)]
*  billion a year tax increase. Secretary Besson brags about $600 billion in revenue. It's a tax [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=149.76s)]
*  increase. It's more than our earnings every year, so we can't absorb it. It's not mathematically [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=157.36s)]
*  possible. It has to be passed on, so they've converted me over into a tax collector. When they [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=162.96s)]
*  say there's other ways to do this, the one way they never talk about is to do it in the sunshine. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=168.96s)]
*  Have a vote in Congress. You want to raise our taxes by $600 billion? Put your name next to it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=174.56s)]
*  Vote in the sunshine. Your company has been in business for about 40 years. You are not just [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=180.56s)]
*  trying to find your footing, and yet you describe the challenges that you're facing, the complete [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=188.32s)]
*  whiplash that you've endured. Has it ever felt this dire for you in your company in these four [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=194.24s)]
*  decades of being around? I don't want to come on TV and have a pity party. We're doing everything [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=201.36s)]
*  that we can to preserve our business, and we will succeed. Okay, so it's rough times. We call this [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=210.48s)]
*  Pandemic 2.0. Personally, I think this is harder than the pandemic. We survived the pandemic and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=218.48s)]
*  grew after the pandemic, so we were fine there, and we will traverse this as well. But this is [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  our own government doing this to us, which is shocking. It's absolutely shocking, and the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=231.12s)]
*  problem is simple. There's a tax increase. This is an emperor has no clothes thing. This is a tax [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=237.44000000000003s)]
*  increase. Who should be surprised at what's happening to small businesses? That's the problem. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=244.56s)]
*  Do you think this administration cares about whether your company survives? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=250.88000000000002s)]
*  No, I don't think they care. They want more car plants, and what we do, which is to help kids learn, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=255.84s)]
*  is for some reason that I can't put my finger on considered not worthy. We have 500 employees. We [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  create great jobs. We spend a lot of money on CapEx and technology. I don't know what's wrong [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=274.0s)]
*  with that. You just ran B-roll of our warehouse. It's a sophisticated place, but we're not making [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=280.16s)]
*  cars. I apologize for that. Rick Woldenburg, you're making toys, toys for kids. That matters too. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=285.76s)]
*  Thank you very much for spending time with us and sharing the insight into your business, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=292.24s)]
*  your dilemma here, and the impact of these tariffs. Good luck. Thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyCLE-HiFg&t=297.76s)]
