# 'Purely political theater': Ex-ICE official slams deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0)
*  I want to bring in Jason Hauser, former chief of staff for immigration and customs enforcement [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=0.0s)]
*  during the Biden administration. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=4.92s)]
*  Jason, thank you very much. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=6.4s)]
*  What's your reaction and how are you reading all of this, specifically on the Abrego Garcia [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=7.92s)]
*  case? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=13.68s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=14.68s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=16.48s)]
*  Quite frankly, I see this as purely political theater. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=17.48s)]
*  There's no time in the history of the Department of Homeland Security or counterterrorism operations, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=22.64s)]
*  at the Department, that we would not be able to bring this individual back to the United [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  States. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  This seems to be purely a decision made at the White House to sort of make this individual [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  an example to show the punitiveness of where Stephen Miller and others want to take our [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=42.64s)]
*  immigration process. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=46.8s)]
*  There's half a dozen ways that DHS or ICE or CBP or State Department or the Department [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=48.72s)]
*  of Defense could bring him home tomorrow. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=56.52s)]
*  Quite frankly, I'm sure there's this week another deportation removal flight that's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=58.4s)]
*  happening in the area of El Salvador. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=63.52s)]
*  He could be brought home there. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=66.72s)]
*  He could be brought home on a commercial flight. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=67.72s)]
*  Whether the contract between El Salvador and the United States government to hold these [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=70.6s)]
*  individuals, put that aside, this individual could be brought home. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=74.32s)]
*  More notably, the president over the weekend is tweeting about how these individuals, the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=79.32s)]
*  migrants that do come here, should be hardworking and upstanding citizens within our communities. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  It's exactly who, quite frankly, the evidence that we've seen in the media, this individual [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=91.68s)]
*  was. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=96.72s)]
*  You had the building trades union leaders this last week screaming for this individual [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=97.72s)]
*  to be brought back because he's a union brother. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=102.4s)]
*  He's a family man and he should be made an example of. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=104.92s)]
*  In my time at ICE or any other administration, this individual could be brought home immediately. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  Why, Jason, do you think there is such a debate underway on this case, the other cases? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=114.76s)]
*  A lot of it has to do with what some critics would say is the lack of responsibility by [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=123.4s)]
*  ICE during this last administration to take seriously the number of people that were coming [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  into our country and both the ones that were coming across the border and asking for asylum, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=137.96s)]
*  which is legally permissible. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=143.2s)]
*  There were some changes in the last couple of months of the Biden administration where [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  the definition of asylum was changed, but also through CBP-1. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=151.92s)]
*  There was challenges and failures in the Biden administration to deal with the massive flow [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=152.92s)]
*  of migrants that we saw after the COVID pandemic subsided. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=161.0s)]
*  There is some mishandling of operations between the border and interior enforcement. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=165.88s)]
*  Those are all duly noted. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=171.36s)]
*  But here in this situation, we have where this White House seems to be locked stock [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=173.72000000000003s)]
*  and barrel into sort of political theater of our immigration system, of making examples [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=179.28s)]
*  of tough graduate students and labor workers in Maryland and trying to show that somehow [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=185.56s)]
*  if you come to this country, that we're going to make it so inauspicious and so cruel that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=191.44000000000003s)]
*  you no longer to see protections under our laws and that we're going to run you out of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=197.52s)]
*  here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  And in my time, and early to that year, 2021 to 2023, I'm happy to compare any day that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  Tom Homan or Stephen Miller want to compare tit for tat of exactly where ICE was focused. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=211.84s)]
*  This administration, the Trump administration, promised clearly that they were going to go [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=219.0s)]
*  after the worst of the worst, that there was millions of criminals in our streets. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=222.32s)]
*  But all I've seen so far is the sort of, is the secretary of homeland security sort of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=227.48s)]
*  sort of playing drink up and going after non-criminals. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=233.04s)]
*  And the number there that the Biden administration focused on convicted criminals that were trying [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=237.72s)]
*  to take advantage of our immigration system, this administration, the Trump administration, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=245.48s)]
*  is focused on the opposite. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=250.76s)]
*  I very much look forward to seeing those numbers and that debate, Jason. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=251.88s)]
*  I thank you. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BECJtQdk0&t=256.92s)]
