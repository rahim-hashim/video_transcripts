# Judge orders Trump admin to provide due process to some migrants deported to El Salvador
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls)
*  Back now to that judge's ruling on a big part of the president's immigration policy, that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=0.0s)]
*  judge ordering the Trump administration to provide hundreds of migrants that were deported [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=5.08s)]
*  to that C-COP prison in El Salvador, the ability to challenge their detention and removal. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=9.76s)]
*  Joining us now is Sky Perryman. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=16.72s)]
*  We got her back. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=18.48s)]
*  She's the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, one of the groups that brought the original [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=19.48s)]
*  suit against the Trump administration when it came to the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=23.44s)]
*  So you and the ACLU filed one of the first lawsuits challenging these deportations to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=27.68s)]
*  that El Salvador prison. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=33.96s)]
*  What's your reaction to this ruling? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=35.6s)]
*  Well, this is a very welcome step and it's entirely what our Constitution requires. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=37.64s)]
*  In this country, which is what we have said from the beginning of this case, people cannot [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=43.64s)]
*  be removed without any process at all. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=47.32s)]
*  And so you see a federal court continuing to require that process under the Constitution. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=49.72s)]
*  So this is a positive thing for our clients. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=54.52s)]
*  And yet the government continues to try to stall the process provided. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=57.080000000000005s)]
*  And so we're going to be working vigilantly in the courts to ensure that everyone gets [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=61.6s)]
*  the process that they are due. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=65.4s)]
*  The judge has given the Trump administration a week to come up with their plan for these [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  men to challenge their detentions. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=71.64s)]
*  What should that look like? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=74.16s)]
*  Well, it should look like process. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=76.64s)]
*  I mean, this is an administration that removed people from the country without doing any [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=79.76s)]
*  diligence providing any type of process. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=84.36s)]
*  So people need access to their lawyers. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=86.6s)]
*  They need to be able to challenge their detention under habeas corpus, which is what, of course, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=88.68s)]
*  what the court ruled yesterday. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=95.36s)]
*  And it's important to note that this ruling came out on the same day that the president [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=97.88s)]
*  banned travel from a range of countries. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=102.48s)]
*  And what has separated the United States from many nations, including countries like Iran, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=105.12s)]
*  is our commitment to process. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=110.08s)]
*  And so you see the court really seeking to enforce that here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=112.68s)]
*  And that's, of course, what we will do every day in the courts alongside our friends at [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=115.28s)]
*  the ACLU. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=118.56s)]
*  I want to read from Judge Boesberg's ruling. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=119.56s)]
*  He says, quote, Perhaps the president lawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=122.04s)]
*  Perhaps, moreover, defendants are correct that plaintiffs are gang members. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=127.28s)]
*  But there is simply no way to know for sure as the CCOT plaintiffs never had any opportunity [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=131.92s)]
*  to challenge the government say so. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=137.72s)]
*  What sort of impact do you think this ruling might have on other cases, such as Kilmar [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=140.44s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia's, which isn't included in this? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, of course, this is an important ruling because it says what the law requires, which [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=147.76s)]
*  is process. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=153.48s)]
*  But you've seen courts across this country. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=154.48s)]
*  You've seen judges appointed by a range of presidents with a range of political viewpoints. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=157.52s)]
*  You've all seen them affirm the notion that people in this country need process. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=163.52s)]
*  But this is a very significant decision. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=168.96s)]
*  We hope that it will improve the lives of people who, again, were removed without any [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=171.56s)]
*  process at all. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=176.8s)]
*  Sky, one thing that we have heard over and over again from the government as it relates [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=178.36s)]
*  to these prisoners in CCOT is that it's impossible to bring detainees back from El Salvador [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=182.34s)]
*  because they're not in U.S. custody anymore. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=188.1s)]
*  And yet, listen to this, a Guatemalan man just arrived back in the United States after [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=190.5s)]
*  a judge ruled in his case that he was wrongfully deported, first to Mexico and then back to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=196.06s)]
*  his native Guatemala. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=202.02s)]
*  Doesn't this prove the administration does have the power to bring back people that they [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=203.74s)]
*  have deported that are in other countries? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=208.38s)]
*  Well, yes, I mean, the administration has been speaking out of both sides of its mouth. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=211.78s)]
*  Sometimes you hear them talk about all the power that they have. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=216.06s)]
*  Other times they throw their hands up and say they have no power. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=219.29999999999998s)]
*  We of course have a lot of concerns about even the legality, frankly, of how the administration [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=222.42s)]
*  is operating with respect to detaining people in El Salvador. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=227.22s)]
*  Those are things that you will start, you know, that you will see continued in the case. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  But it's important to just focus on the fact that the courts across the country are seeing [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=234.18s)]
*  this for what it is. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  They are doing everything they can to ensure that people have access to process. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=240.7s)]
*  And that's really what our task is going to be over the coming days. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=244.66s)]
*  Sky Perryman, thank you very much for working out those tech snafus and joining us to share [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=247.98s)]
*  all of your expertise and your response to this order. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=253.98s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VXDWfLtls&t=257.7s)]
