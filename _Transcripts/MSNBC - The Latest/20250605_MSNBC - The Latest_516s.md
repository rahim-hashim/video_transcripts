# ‘Sit back, watch all this trouble in paradise’: Dems welcoming the Trump-Musk scuffle
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg)
*  Let's bring in NBC News chief Capitol Hill correspondent Ryan Nobles along with CEO of the Forward Party and former Romney regional finance director [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=0.0s)]
*  Lindsey Draft and senior adviser to vote vets and former Democratic congressman Max Rose [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=7.66s)]
*  Ryan with Musk's new demand to kill the bill [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=14.34s)]
*  Where do we stand on Capitol Hill this morning as Musk puts his political influence up against President Trump's? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=17.34s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that there this has necessarily stopped the forward momentum from this package getting passed [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=24.419999999999998s)]
*  I think that there are were always the same concerns that Elon Musk is echoing with [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=31.339999999999996s)]
*  Members of both the Senate and the House Republican caucus that the bill does not cut enough [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=36.7s)]
*  But I think if most congressional Republicans are forced to choose between Donald Trump or Elon Musk [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=41.42s)]
*  They're probably gonna choose Donald Trump every day and twice on Sunday [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=46.94s)]
*  That's just the way that this a congressional Republican caucus has operated that being said though [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=50.74s)]
*  Republicans are gonna be forced to make a more compelling case to their constituents that are concerned about government spending that this bill cuts [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=55.82s)]
*  Enough and that means rebutting the findings of the Congressional Budget Office [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=63.7s)]
*  Which has demonstrated now on two separate occasions on the scoring of this bill that it will actually increase the deficit [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  Listen to how Republicans are responding to those results from the CBO [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  We went through it again today [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  I [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=83.94s)]
*  Just don't know that we have much faith in the CBO again [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=85.18s)]
*  They were wrong on Kennedy tax cuts Reagan Trump's when is the CBO been right and it's not been very often [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  We believe that if you don't if you take the CBO assumptions, which were [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=94.98s)]
*  Dramatically off when it came to 2017 tax bill [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=99.94s)]
*  But if you if you take pretty much everybody else's economic modeling [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=103.42s)]
*  And you realize there's gonna be growth as a result of passing this bill that growth generates additional government revenue [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=108.1s)]
*  So a bit of a fact check here the CBO certainly did not get the results of the 2017 tax bill a hundred percent accurate [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=115.41999999999999s)]
*  That's nearly impossible to do you're forecasting the future [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=123.6s)]
*  There are so many variables that need to be taken into account [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=126.3s)]
*  But they were not dramatically off and one of the things that the CBO [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=128.9s)]
*  Reviewed during the 2017 tax cuts was that there was not going to be enough growth in the government to offset the cost of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=133.5s)]
*  These tax cuts certainly the government did grow they did not take that into account fully [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=140.58s)]
*  But they were correct in their assumption that it would not be enough to pay for the tax cuts in totality and what Republicans are now [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=145.94s)]
*  Trying to sell is a tax plan that would make those tax cuts [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=153.62s)]
*  Permanent and argue that the growth that would come from as a result of it would be enough to pay for them [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=157.86s)]
*  The CBO doesn't agree a lot of economic experts don't agree certainly [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=162.66s)]
*  There is some growth that is a result of tax cuts, but they rarely if ever fully pay for themselves on them [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=167.34s)]
*  Yeah, and Lindsay it's interesting that President Trump has been unusually quiet as he continues to take incoming from Elon Musk just really [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=173.14s)]
*  thrashing and trashing and bombarding this bill online [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=181.7s)]
*  What do you make of his relative silence given he's so quick to hit back usually I think the question is is he taking this [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=185.33999999999997s)]
*  Personally, we know that Elon Musk is taking this very personally, you know [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=192.26s)]
*  The EV tax credits were taken out of the reconciliation bill [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=196.14s)]
*  He did not get his preferred nominee for NASA. So he's he's a little burned and now he's come back [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=201.14s)]
*  It's obvious he's taking this very personally. The question is whether or not the president is gonna respond in turn [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=208.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, congressman Rose Democrats on Capitol Hill are now saying hey, we agree with Elon Musk who would have thought right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  I mean politics can make for strange bedfellows [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=220.02s)]
*  But do you think that this is a strategy that the Democrats could use to slow the bills trajectory? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=223.06s)]
*  Democrats don't need to do very much right now. I think you just sit back and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=229.26000000000002s)]
*  Watch all of this trouble in paradise [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=233.3s)]
*  No [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=235.66s)]
*  A few short months ago Elon Musk was on an absolutely destructive role throughout Washington, DC [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=236.26s)]
*  As the leader of Doge firing tens of thousands of veterans [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  But he did have one singular goal in mind and that was to very quickly and rapidly cut the size and scope of the federal [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=247.62s)]
*  Government and now what he's coming to realize this was a newcomer to politics [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=254.18s)]
*  Is that the Republican Party going all the way back to Bush has never been? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=257.98s)]
*  Fiscally conservative or reasonable they talk about it during campaigns, but then once they have the levers of power [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=263.9s)]
*  They are the most fiscally reckless party that can be Donald Trump can say he's not like Bush very clearly is with this bill [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=270.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, the nonpartisan congressional budget office says this bill will add [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=277.64s)]
*  2.4 trillion dollars to the national debt over the course of 10 years Lindsay [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=282.34s)]
*  Why doesn't that seem to be giving more Republicans pause? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=286.82s)]
*  Well, it does give Ron Johnson pause and I'm gonna disagree with you Max and the James Carville [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=290.98s)]
*  Recommendation to sit back and watch this all play out. I worked for Ron Johnson [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=297.14s)]
*  He doesn't care about making friends and actually it makes him wildly popular in Wisconsin [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=302.02000000000004s)]
*  he doesn't care about keeping a seat and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=307.78000000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk has given him a little bit of cover along with some other members of the Republican Senate to say we have to do [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=310.14s)]
*  Senator Johnson wants to go through this line by line and he and Rand Paul and some others on the sidelines [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=316.54s)]
*  I think are gonna force this but do you think voters actually care that much about the national debt? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=322.92s)]
*  I mean, that's never an issue that comes up near the top during election season [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=328.26s)]
*  Yeah, I I think that if we start to expose some of the things that are included in this bill [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=331.86s)]
*  It will make Americans stand up and pay attention. We'll see I guess some House Republicans, of course are saying the CBO is [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=336.2s)]
*  Wrong and in fact, I think it was the White House press secretary who said this is just a partisan attack this [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=344.58s)]
*  Report from the CBO Ryan gave us a great fact check that the CBO is not partisan in how they operate [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=350.91999999999996s)]
*  It's a nonpartisan organization [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  in fact the head of it is a [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=360.05999999999995s)]
*  Republican who served under the the George Bush administration and the CBO actually explicitly [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=362.05999999999995s)]
*  Prohibits employees from engaging in political activity that could be perceived as biased. So congressman Rose [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=367.58s)]
*  What do you make of that attack line? It's absurd and they're not basing that off of anything [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=373.14s)]
*  I mean there are no [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=378.62s)]
*  Legitimate experts even outside of the CBO that claim that this is a fiscally responsible [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=380.7s)]
*  Bill but let's for a moment assume in a world of flying pigs and fairies that this is [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  Fiscally responsible look at what they're still trying to do [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=393.94s)]
*  They're trying to cut health care throughout the country for hard-working people who rely on it every day [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=397.54s)]
*  That's gonna lead to hospitals closing and hundreds of thousands of people getting fired all to give that money away to people who? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=404.54s)]
*  Certifiably do not need it who are their donors [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=412.22s)]
*  So if that's what they need to lean back on here [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=414.70000000000005s)]
*  This is not going to work out [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=417.66s)]
*  The truth of the matter is where these folks are the most comfortable is when they get to claim that they're not woke [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=419.3s)]
*  When they actually have governing responsibility, they are utterly incompetent and that is showing through each and every day [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=425.14s)]
*  I mean you said it's not gonna work out but quickly if you will Lindsay B. We heard Thune say [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=431.14s)]
*  Republicans can't fail here [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=435.66s)]
*  This is it's not that failure is not an option for Republicans in a way politically. Is he right? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=437.5s)]
*  Thune said failure is not an option [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=443.98s)]
*  but the other thing that he did on Monday of this week is say that the Senate will uphold the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=445.94s)]
*  Rulings of the parliamentarian and look at this bill and how it's being pushed through a reconciliation bill is not supposed to be [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=451.82s)]
*  Making rules and laws it's supposed to allow us to get the government funded [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=459.22s)]
*  Which is why they can expedite the filibuster in the Senate [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=463.78000000000003s)]
*  the Senate [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=467.14000000000004s)]
*  Parliamentarian is going to be critically important here because she's going to itemize this bill in the same way that Senator Johnson is asking for and [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=468.14s)]
*  Kick out things that have nothing to do with the federal budget [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=474.26s)]
*  So if you look at for example the the provision in there that would limit the ability for judges [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=477.18s)]
*  To hold people in contempt of court. I don't understand what that has to do with funding the federal government and she's gonna find those [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=483.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of Americans would say the same thing. Thank you and see draft the former congressman Max Rose [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=489.14s)]
*  I appreciate the conversation [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=494.2s)]
*  You [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee7YK0D7Leg&t=507.06s)]
