# ‘We are strongest in the broken places’: Biden speaks out on prostate cancer diagnosis
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0)
*  In his first mess in the first message from Joe Biden after his office confirmed that he's battling an aggressive form of prostate cancer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=0.0s)]
*  The former president shared a photo of himself side-by-side with his wife Jill and the note [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=7.18s)]
*  Cancer touches us all like so many of you Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=12.84s)]
*  Thank you for lifting us up with love and support [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=18.92s)]
*  Biden and his family are now reviewing treatment options with his physicians according to a statement from his team [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=22.32s)]
*  This is dr. Zeke Emanuel [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=27.78s)]
*  Oncologist who once served on Biden's COVID advisory board speaking on morning Joe today [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=30.46s)]
*  Doesn't it take [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=36.980000000000004s)]
*  some time [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=38.74s)]
*  For prostate cancer to develop to point where it would spread to the bones. Oh [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=40.14s)]
*  He's had this for many years. Maybe even a decade growing there and spreading. That's right [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=46.5s)]
*  It's a little surprising [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=55.02s)]
*  I look back at the records and there's no evidence that when he got his health [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=57.02s)]
*  Status and the medical records were released that he had a prostate specific antigen [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=63.38s)]
*  NBC's Aaron Gilchrist is live in Wilmington, Delaware near the former president's home also joining us MSNBC medical contributor [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=70.22s)]
*  Dr. Vin Gupta Peter Baker is back as well [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  Doctor how easy or difficult is prostate cancer to detect? Let's start with the baseline [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=79.78s)]
*  Well, Chris it [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=84.9s)]
*  The process of Ganesha is a blood test. It's not perfect and it's about 70 to 80 percent sensitive [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=87.34s)]
*  So there's a lot of false positives [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=92.3s)]
*  Which is why there is there's abstractions when we talk about this test and whether and who should get screened for it [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=94.3s)]
*  It's not clear. It's not as clear as a mammography for women and breast cancer or colonoscopies for colorectal cancer [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=100.7s)]
*  It's a lot of shades of gray. They're 40 and over with the family history as a male [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  You should get screened for everybody else between 50 and 70 is the recommendation to go and have a conversation with their medical provider [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=111.34s)]
*  But again, there's abstractions in the case the president former president here. Dr. Emanuel is correct [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=116.78s)]
*  There is no evidence of a PSA being reported on in the prior physical exams [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=123.1s)]
*  Unlike say President Trump about from President Obama and Bush [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=127.46s)]
*  They all had PSA levels in their physical exam readout not the case with former President Biden [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=130.57999999999998s)]
*  So unclear whether that would have changed anything but it is true that stage four metastatic prostate cancer doesn't happen over a hundred day period [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=136.1s)]
*  This is probably something that's been there for a period of time [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=143.1s)]
*  Aaron, what do we know about the path ahead for the former president? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=146.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, Chris, we know that it's going to be a difficult one [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=150.57999999999998s)]
*  Cancer is something that has been a part of the Biden life story in one form or another either dealing with his son's cancer [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  Dealing with skin lesions of his own over time having to deal with policymaking and funding for cancer research and treatment development [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=159.58s)]
*  This has been something that President Biden has had to deal with in one way or another for a long time [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=166.58s)]
*  And so what we know if we back up a bit here to last week in the office of the president former president the statement they put out yesterday [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=171.58s)]
*  Reiterate some of this we know that they deserve a little bit of a reward for their work [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=178.58s)]
*  We know that they discovered a nodule on his prostate last week and upon further examination they were able to diagnose him with prostate cancer [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=184.58s)]
*  That was on Friday and said that it was characterized by a Gleason score of nine with metastasis to the bone [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=191.58s)]
*  Meaning it was a very aggressive form of cancer and that it had spread from his prostate to his bones as well [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=198.58s)]
*  We also understand from that statement that the prostate cancer was a very aggressive form of cancer [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=205.58s)]
*  We understand from that statement that the Biden family is looking at their options here and a source familiar with the thinking of the Biden family [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=212.58s)]
*  Has told NBC News that hormone treatment is one of the things that the Bidens are considering [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=219.58s)]
*  We've been told again by his office that this is a hormone sensitive form of prostate cancer that the former president has [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=225.58s)]
*  And that means that the treatment with hormone therapy may be something that's available to him that could be successful [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=233.58s)]
*  Chris, we also took a look at some of the former health records that were released by the White House during the Biden presidency [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=241.58s)]
*  There was no mention of a PSA screening having been done on the former president or any results from that sort of a test [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=248.58s)]
*  And so we don't know if this is something that had been checked for at some point during his presidency [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=255.58s)]
*  And I think Chris too it's worth noting I was at an event with former President Biden and Dr. Biden in New Orleans last August [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=260.58000000000004s)]
*  I should say this was right after he had dropped out of the race for president [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=270.58s)]
*  He was talking about his cancer moonshot initiative and I was going through some of my notes back then [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=274.58s)]
*  He said that we know that all families touched by cancer are in a race against time [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=279.58s)]
*  And so we can imagine that as the Biden family has huddled here in Wilmington [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=284.58s)]
*  They are trying to quickly go through their options to figure out what they can do to buy as much time as possible as so many families touched by cancer have had to do, Chris [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=288.58s)]
*  Yeah, doctor, too many people know how tough these decisions can be [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=296.58s)]
*  So in addition to hormone treatments, are there other standard options that someone in Joe Biden's position would likely be offered? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=301.58s)]
*  Absolutely. And so I imagine they're going to start out. There's been a lot of innovations [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=309.58s)]
*  The positive news here is that there's a lot of innovations in hormone based therapies for prostate cancer [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=315.58s)]
*  So they're likely going to do a combination approach here. So two treatments or more that are going to be able to deprive his cancer of what it needs to grow and get worse, which is good [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=320.58s)]
*  That's a great that's great news. Radiotherapy is an option if that doesn't work. But I suspect given all the innovations out there, these tend to be well tolerated therapeutics [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=330.58s)]
*  And he will be a good candidate for it because he is he is a robust 81 year old in terms of this physical fitness and activities of daily living [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=340.58s)]
*  You know, we've all seen it. He's able to get around. So his performance status is good and he has some good treatment options here that should be that should allow him to have some form of recovery [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=348.58s)]
*  So Peter, his diagnosis created fodder for critics on the right wing social media sphere and that led to a reaction from Megan McCain, of course, her dad, Arizona Senator John McCain died of cancer in 2018 [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=359.58s)]
*  And she wrote this. I don't know if it's just my bias or background, but I don't want to hear anything else about Biden's health cover up tell all interviews with staff, et cetera [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=372.58s)]
*  Let the Biden family be in peace right now. This is all just so sad and imprudent. What does it say that even a cancer diagnosis and again, it's touched [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=382.58s)]
*  It seems virtually every American, whether a friend or family or personally that even for a day there's there's no pause on the divisiveness [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=394.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's that kind of polarized moment. Right. And it happens that this diagnosis came at a particularly fraught moment for the former president because we were already re engaged in the debate about his insistence on running for a second term in the first place [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=403.58s)]
*  Before he had to drop out last year because of the debacle of a debate performance with the new book coming out tomorrow by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson with the release of that tape of the president's former president's interview with the special counsel when he sounded so uncertain and confused [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=417.58s)]
*  All of that was sort of in the air when this diagnosis was put out and talk about cover ups and what the staff knew what it didn't know how he thought he could have been an effective president in a second term that would have meant he would have been serving until he was 86 [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=435.58s)]
*  Reasonable questions, but it does feel like this particular moment given the diagnosis highlights just how politics shades everything even a human moment when a family is going through what this family is going through. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=449.58s)]
*  I was struck by a phrase he put in that tweet you presented on the on the screen. We are strongest in the broken places. That's a very evocative phrase and gets at the heart of President Biden's lifetime identity in politics and in his personal life. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=461.58s)]
*  He has, of course, gone through so many different trials over the course of his life that the car accident that killed his first wife and young daughter the cancer that took his oldest son that his own struggles with health issues like an aneurysm in 1980s. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=479.58s)]
*  You know his struggles with stuttering as a young man. His father always told him when you are knocked down you get back up. So resilience has been his identity as a politician and as a person throughout this long life of his and he's going now into one one more struggle where I think that he's determined to overcome it again. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=498.58s)]
*  Peter, I want to play just a little bit more of what Zeke Emanuel told Joe this morning. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=518.5799999999999s)]
*  If you have prostate cancer that is spread to the bone, then he's most certainly you are saying had it when he was president of the United States. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=527.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he did not develop it in the last hundred 200 days. He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=537.58s)]
*  And I understand what Meghan McCain wrote. But are there important political questions that deserve answers or maybe our questions not for Joe Biden directly but other people as well? Where do you see this going politically? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=551.58s)]
*  In a thoughtful way, not in an accusatory way. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=568.58s)]
*  Absolutely. There are reasonable questions. When you're president of the United States, you sacrifice the privacy that any of the rest of us might have a right to in terms of questions of health and medical status. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=572.58s)]
*  And it's going to raise questions about what tests were given, when they were given, when they were not given, why they were not given, while he was president. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=582.58s)]
*  I think that's a good point. I think Dr. Gupta can speak to this better than I can about what the standards say. You're not supposed to necessarily give a PSA test, which would possibly give an indication of prostate cancer when you're over 70 without an indication. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=590.58s)]
*  But given he was president, the question a lot of people are asking is shouldn't they give every test anyway? I've taken PSA tests. It's not like it was a big ordeal or an expensive thing. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=602.58s)]
*  So why didn't they, if they didn't see signs of this earlier, people will ask that question, of course, going forward. Because the question of whether or not this president and his people were fully forthcoming to the public about his age and the medical issues that he confronted has been a persistent one and one that hasn't been answered satisfactorily for a lot of people, not just Republicans but even Democrats. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=611.58s)]
*  Yeah, and the questions that were raised each time that President Trump's own doctors made statements about his health. So first and foremost, we wish Joe Biden and his family only the best and a quick recovery that all of this goes well for him. But Aaron Gilchrist, Dr. Van Gupta, Peter Baker, thank you all. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=636.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEE3uxZKa0&t=666.58s)]
