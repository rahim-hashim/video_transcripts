# 'Every American should be concerned' over Trump admin trying to deny due process: Lawyer
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc)
*  And we have an update on another story that we brought to you yesterday concerning a deported [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=0.0s)]
*  Venezuelan man, Wiedemar Algelvez. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=4.58s)]
*  A federal judge in Texas ruled yesterday that the Trump administration must, by tomorrow, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  allow him attorney access from that notorious Supermax prison in El Salvador. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=12.58s)]
*  This order is the first of its kind surrounding the president's use of the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=17.5s)]
*  And it should be noted that Algelvez came to the U.S. under the Refugee Resettlement [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  program and is part of a process that involves extensive vetting and background checks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=26.5s)]
*  Sky Perryman is joining us now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=32.06s)]
*  She's the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which has sued the Trump administration [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=33.46s)]
*  over its use of the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=37.94s)]
*  Sky, thanks for being here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  The El Salvador prison, we know, generally offers zero contact between inmates and the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=42.5s)]
*  outside world. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  And here we have this judge giving the government not only 24 hours to confirm where Algelvez [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=49.66s)]
*  is being held, but also then 48 hours to restore and help maintain attorney-client [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=55.5s)]
*  communication with him. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=60.1s)]
*  Are you concerned that they may just ignore the court's ruling? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=61.42s)]
*  Well, I think the main thing that we want everyone to understand is that the federal [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=65.38s)]
*  courts continue to be unrelenting in their commitment, as our Constitution promises, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=69.66s)]
*  to due process and to ensuring that the executive branch in this country, that the president [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  and his administration are not above the law. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=81.38s)]
*  We've already heard that the government wants to appeal this order. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=84.13999999999999s)]
*  But I think that that's also something that every American should be concerned about. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=89.02s)]
*  Why is it that this president and this administration do not want people to be able to access their [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=92.61999999999999s)]
*  attorneys when they are being detained? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=98.33999999999999s)]
*  That is a fundamental question that should concern all of us in this country, because [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  of course, if it could happen to this individual, it could happen to any of us. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=104.89999999999999s)]
*  How hopeful are you that this phone call, this contact is allowed? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=109.14s)]
*  You know, I do have confidence that the courts are going to continue. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=113.3s)]
*  You've seen this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=118.06s)]
*  The courts will continue to ensure that their orders are enforced. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=119.06s)]
*  We're all waiting and watching to see what will happen with the appellate court. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=122.34s)]
*  But this is due process, plain and simple. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=126.18s)]
*  This is what our Constitution requires, what our Constitution provides, and I think that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=128.5s)]
*  it's a positive development, certainly, this judge's orders in the case. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=134.26s)]
*  We have seen this administration in the past kind of just throw up their hands and say, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=137.86s)]
*  well, there's nothing we can do in regards to other court rulings. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=141.46s)]
*  If they do that again, what can the courts do? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=144.58s)]
*  You know, the courts do have a range of powers, and you're already seeing that even in the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  Alien Enemies Act cases. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=152.22000000000003s)]
*  You have a federal court in Washington that has already found that the government, that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=153.72000000000003s)]
*  there is probable cause to believe that the government engaged in contempt. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=158.06s)]
*  We are going to see over the course of the next weeks and months ahead, the federal courts [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=161.46s)]
*  in this country have to utilize their powers to hold the government accountable to their [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=166.46s)]
*  orders. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  They do have those powers. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=171.70000000000002s)]
*  Lawyers that are appearing before federal courts in this country, if they do not take [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=173.46s)]
*  steps to ensure that their clients abide by court orders, there are particular disciplinary [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  proceedings and other proceedings that can get the lawyers in trouble. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=182.82s)]
*  And then, of course, in this country, no one, not even the president, is above the law, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=186.46s)]
*  and you're really going to see the courts, I think, have to enforce that line. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=190.34s)]
*  Let's talk about the Supreme Court's ruling yesterday, allowing the Trump administration [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=194.14s)]
*  to move forward with revoking temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=198.7s)]
*  What does that mean for them? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=204.61999999999998s)]
*  Can they now be deported? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=205.61999999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, this is really concerning for so many people who have been following [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=206.61999999999998s)]
*  this case and, of course, for our overall system. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=212.01999999999998s)]
*  But it's important to note that what the Supreme Court did yesterday is they really just put [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=215.17999999999998s)]
*  a pause on an injunction, a court order that a lower court issued, finding, by the way, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=219.02s)]
*  that what the Trump administration had done was unlawful. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  And so you see the Supreme Court wanting this to move through the district court and the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=227.34s)]
*  appellate courts, and that's what will happen. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=232.34s)]
*  There's obviously a lot of concern, and you heard that from immigration advocates and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=234.5s)]
*  from other civil society advocates yesterday, about what is going to happen to people while [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=237.94s)]
*  the court proceedings are playing out. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=243.82000000000002s)]
*  But I think the important thing for everyone to know is that there is not a court yet in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=245.94000000000003s)]
*  this country that has held that what the Trump administration is doing right now is lawful. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=250.02s)]
*  And we're going to have to wait and see how this process plays out. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=254.46s)]
*  Sky Perryman, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=257.06s)]
*  I appreciate your time and your expertise on these matters. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=259.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbLTHiPafc&t=275.86s)]
