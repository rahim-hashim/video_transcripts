# Harvard president seems willing to 'go pretty far' in fight against Trump admin: Steve Inskeep
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA)
*  Steve, I want to highlight a part of your interview this morning with Harvard president Alan Garber reacting to the Trump administration's multiple moves. Let's listen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=0.0s)]
*  What is perplexing is the the measures that they have taken to address these that don't even hit the same people that they believe are causing the problems. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=9.0s)]
*  Why cut off research funding? The research funding is given to universities and other research institutions to carry out work that the research work that the federal government designates as high priority work. It is work that they want done. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=21.8s)]
*  So it's like the federal government sabotaging itself is how he puts it and it clearly looks like he's going to hold his ground. Steve, an administration official, however, suggests a leadership change at Harvard is the only solution to this feud. What's your sense? How far is Harvard willing to take this fight and how far is Garber personally willing to go? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=41.8s)]
*  Garber seems personally willing to go pretty far. He's a mild-mannered guy. He is soft spoken, but has now sued the administration twice and is urging other universities as well to be firm. He interprets the latest moves by the administration as a threat against all universities, all academic institutions. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=62.4s)]
*  And in fact, the Department of Homeland Security last week when they said they would deny Harvard the ability to host international students actually did literally say in a statement, let this be a warning to all academic institutions. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=82.0s)]
*  Garber contends that this is unfair, that Harvard has tried to cooperate with the federal government, has tried to give information about international students, for example, but he suspects without knowing for sure that there's a broader agenda here and he connects that with conservative efforts to somehow bring down elite institutions, which he says is misdirected. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=94.0s)]
*  And of course, the administration is claiming this is about anti-Semitism on Harvard's campus, the lack of diversity of thought on campus. How is Garber addressing those criticisms? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=117.0s)]
*  Oh, now that's very interesting because Garber would acknowledge that they have a point there. Garber is concerned. He's Jewish himself and says that he's concerned about anti-Semitism on campus, about Jewish students or Israeli students, international students, being shunned, his word, if they had the wrong opinion of the Israel Hamas war, for example. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=127.0s)]
*  And he also acknowledged that it is a problem in a major research university if students or even professors have to think twice about expressing what's on their minds. He contends that they've tried in the last year to address those issues and contends that that is one of the reasons that the academic year now ending, it's graduation week at Harvard, that the academic year now ending was more peaceful than the last one. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=148.0s)]
*  Even though Harvard is fighting back, James, I can't help but wonder as you are covering this story in the many interviews that you've done, has there been a chilling effect at all with students or faculty on campus? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=172.0s)]
*  There's been a self-centership, but I mean, I think what Steve's last point there is an important one. This all comes not at a flash point in time. There are not massive protests occurring at the Harvard campus, just like there was a couple years ago in the aftermath of the October 7th attacks and when the war on Gaza began. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=185.0s)]
*  Certainly there's a sentiment about the situation, but this is not a particular moment where presidential action is particularly needed right now. So look, Garber is loaded for bear. He has a lot of institutional support. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=206.0s)]
*  And unlike, say, the situation at Columbia earlier where things were getting out of hand, Donald Trump wants scalps. He wants deals. He wants action. He doesn't really care about the particulars. So he would love a scalp. But I think in this particular case, Harvard can wait him out. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=220.0s)]
*  I want to ask you more about that, Garrett, because President Trump just keeps upping the ante, sort of like how he's approached the China terror fight to make the pain unbearable until his target eventually breaks. So what is the administration's end game? What is their response as well to this argument that what they're doing really hurts the U.S. as a whole and has potentially long-term consequences on the U.S. economy? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=237.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I think the answer to your first question was in your question, and they very much expect Harvard to break and look around. They see plenty of evidence of other elite institutions breaking when pressured, whether it is Columbia University or some of the elite law firms who've caved to administration pressure and struck deals. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=264.0s)]
*  They believe that they turn the screws hard enough that Harvard will eventually come around, that they are too dependent on the federal government and on federal largesse across the board to continue things like the research that is done there. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=280.0s)]
*  On that topic, I think the administration takes a perhaps short-sighted view that Harvard is a good political enemy, that they can make a case against graduate students and for plumbers and roofers and electricians. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=294.0s)]
*  Remember, this started with a social media post yesterday from President Trump saying he would strip grant funding from the university, which would go to scientific and medical research, and give it to trade schools. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=307.0s)]
*  They like the political contrast this opportunity presents in the short term. In the long term, those economic implications, if they exist, probably not happen on their watch, and I think that may be a risk they're willing to take. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=317.0s)]
*  As we look at this graphic showing all of the many ways the Trump administration has been going after Harvard, doubling, tripling down, James, you recently pointed out that in many ways Harvard is using Trump's own legal tactics as it fights back. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=331.0s)]
*  Deny wrongdoing, have elite lawyers challenge every step of the process, stall, delay, wait it out, and you argue Harvard may actually hold the better cards. Why is that? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=344.0s)]
*  Well, look, certainly they are an institution as we saw in Steve's interview with President Garber this morning. They've been around longer than the United States. They have the largest endowment. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=354.0s)]
*  They may not be the perfect foil for Donald Trump, but nonetheless, he's a second term lame duck president, and they're an institution that's been around for hundreds of years and has billions of dollars, and they can wait this out. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=364.0s)]
*  I mean, look, the bottom line is they are using this as a way to stand up for something. They are getting credit in ways that other institutions were not. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=374.0s)]
*  But yes, the delaying tactics using the courts. You know, Donald Trump may not be president for just a couple more years, and certainly, obviously, the midterm elections are going to have a different effect, and he's going to start looking elsewhere like he did with California today. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=384.0s)]
*  But in many ways, Harvard does seem to be taking the playbook of Donald Trump when he had all of his criminal trials. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=399.0s)]
*  Steve, has all of this forced Harvard to change the way it operates at this point? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=405.0s)]
*  I think the pressure over the past couple of years has forced some changes, some reforms at Harvard, beginning with the fact that Garber is president. There was a different president a couple of years ago who was forced out amid a plagiarism scandal, among many other things. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=411.0s)]
*  So Harvard has been forced to make some changes. I'm sure their critics don't find the changes to be that deep, and the debate goes on. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=425.0s)]
*  James, you note that four of the nine current Supreme Court justices are actually Harvard alumni. So I wonder if this lawsuit does get that far. How do you see that playing out? Could we even see some of these justices? These are the four. So two liberals, two conservatives who are Harvard alumni. Could they recuse themselves? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=433.0s)]
*  One of them, the former Harvard Law School dean. Look, I don't think they need to recuse themselves. It's a simple matter of academic freedom, and Harvard has a pretty strong case to have right here. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=453.0s)]
*  Look, the larger question about where all this is going is really, again, about timeline. Donald Trump is losing power every single day, just as any second term president is. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=465.0s)]
*  He's trying to get some points on the board, and clearly he sees this as a great foil and a great fight politically as he engages in the culture wars. But again, this is no flash point issue here when it comes to anti-Semitism. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=477.0s)]
*  And I think the real key thing here is, look, obviously Harvard's a very big deal for the economy in a region like New England, but we're talking about some of the most important hospitals in the entire world that are Harvard-teaching hospitals like Mass General Hospital that are not as effective as the ones that are in the United States. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=489.0s)]
*  And I think that's an important piece of the puzzle looking forward, not just in terms of the U.S. economy, but clearly, obviously locally here. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtv7oFN7UA&t=507.0s)]
