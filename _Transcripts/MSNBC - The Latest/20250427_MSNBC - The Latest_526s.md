# Schiff: Trump is ‘relishing’ the chance to go after judges in immigration cases
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk)
*  Here with me now is promised to Senator Adam Schiff of California senator. It's good to see you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=0.0s)]
*  There's quite a bit going on right now, so I want to talk to you about all that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=4.24s)]
*  I just want to start with the polls because they're pretty consistent and Trump is underwater on a number of issues [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=8.2s)]
*  My theory I just talked through this is that part of that is his misread of what he called a mandate and just this massive [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=14.24s)]
*  Overreach in a number of areas, but how do you see it? I think that's exactly right [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=20.88s)]
*  He's claiming that he had this huge mandate which of course he didn't have [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=25.88s)]
*  But more than that they keep saying that he's just falling through on his promises [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=29.54s)]
*  But in fact he's not his main promise was he was going to prove the economy was going to bring prices down of course [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=33.76s)]
*  Everything he has done has been contradictory to that the tariff wars have just driven inflationary pressures even higher [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=40.78s)]
*  American families are struggling even more so the really the central promise [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=49.06s)]
*  He has reneged on and now he's doing all these other things that he never promised during the campaign in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=53.14s)]
*  Fact to the degree that they were written about during the campaign in project [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=58.54s)]
*  2025 he tried to run away and disavow them [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=62.38s)]
*  So he doesn't have a mandate to do what he's doing and I think it's reflected in the already enormous voter [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=66.10000000000001s)]
*  Dissatisfaction in his first hundred days. Yeah, no people are just starting to feel the tariffs [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=73.18s)]
*  They're gonna feel them a lot more which I imagine is gonna be worse for him [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=77.98s)]
*  We'll see what he does [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=81.26s)]
*  One of the numbers are some of the sets of numbers that were very interesting to me were around immigration and one of the ones [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=82.26s)]
*  That stuck out to me was the approval rating for his handling of the Kilmer Obrego Garcia [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=87.26s)]
*  Case which is very interesting because a lot of people I feel like there was some commentary saying we shouldn't talk about it [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=92.82000000000001s)]
*  Or shouldn't be front and center, but only 31% of people have approved of his handling of that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=98.86s)]
*  Which is I think very telling [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=105.94s)]
*  What's interesting about him? I mentioned this too though is that when things like that are clear in the polling? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=109.06s)]
*  He still goes a step farther. I mean he had he arrested a judge Judge Hannah Duggan in Milwaukee this week [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=113.78s)]
*  He had arrested a former judge in New Mexico this week [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=120.3s)]
*  It feels a little bit like he's still escalating on the immigration front even when the polling is telling you something different [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=123.1s)]
*  But what are you seeing about his actions out there? Yeah, I was struck by that on the polling, too [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=129.86s)]
*  There were a couple things that left out at me one was just how poor his numbers were in the handling of that case [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=134.46s)]
*  Because you're right there was some saying this is a distraction. We shouldn't go there [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=139.78s)]
*  But this is to me the tip of the spear in terms of his violation of the rule of law [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  basically ignoring a court order to facilitate the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=150.5s)]
*  return of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  Obrego Garcia Kilmer Obrego Garcia who was by their own admission [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  deported in error [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=162.3s)]
*  And so the fact that his numbers are so terrible on that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=164.46s)]
*  Means, you know the public is understanding the case finds it important [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=168.9s)]
*  Doesn't agree with what the president is doing and that case I think and others [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=174.62s)]
*  Including now we're learning about him deported or the administration to porting a four-year-old with a stage four cancer without [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=179.46s)]
*  giving [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=187.42s)]
*  the family a chance to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  Keep that kid here [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=191.06s)]
*  US citizen get get the necessary treatment the other number that really stood out to me though was [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=192.98s)]
*  By a two-to-one margin 50 to 21 [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=198.85999999999999s)]
*  People think that he has made their economic circumstances worse rather than better [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=202.3s)]
*  That those are really damning numbers. So [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=207.7s)]
*  But but even more broadly on immigration [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=211.42s)]
*  What concerns me gravely because now they're using [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=214.82s)]
*  Courthouses as a fulcrum for immigration policy. They're using the IRS to enforce immigration policy [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=219.5s)]
*  They're taking people's appointments with immigration [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=225.98000000000002s)]
*  To turn around and deport them even when people go to get their citizenship [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=229.82s)]
*  Take their citizenship both what that's going to mean is [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=234.94s)]
*  fewer [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=239.3s)]
*  Undocumented people willing to go to court and most the time when undocumented people go to court. They're not the defendant [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=240.86s)]
*  They're the victim or they're the witness so they're not going to participate in the justice system [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=246.38s)]
*  Why file your taxes if they're going to use your taxes against you to deport you? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=252.01999999999998s)]
*  So it's going to mean a lot of people aren't going to be paying their taxes that would normally be paying taxes [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=257.58s)]
*  People aren't going to show up for their immigration appointments because they'll fear they're going to be used to just grab them instead of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=262.74s)]
*  Whatever process they're in so it's going to mean millions of people going deeper into the shadows, which is not [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=269.14s)]
*  In the interest of law enforcement or tax collection or society so in the bigger picture [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=276.42s)]
*  I think it's a real mistake [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=282.58s)]
*  That's it. I've never thought about it exactly that way [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=285.7s)]
*  It's interesting how it deters people from participating in aspects of the system paying taxes and again [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=288.1s)]
*  Going to courts when when they need to be defended themselves the judge the arresting the rest of the judge in Wisconsin [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  Again, not isolated felt jarring [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=301.38s)]
*  I know that we should be charged by too many things these days [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=304.18s)]
*  Do you think I mean you've you've done the studying of Donald Trump for a long time is that to scare people to deter? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=307.74s)]
*  judges from [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=314.86s)]
*  Doing what their job is what do you think the motivation is behind that I think it is [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=316.46s)]
*  You know in a normal rational world you would have immigration authorities work with a courthouse and decide okay [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=321.41999999999996s)]
*  How do we how do we work together or how do we at least? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  Not interfere with what each other are doing you wouldn't have the kind of confrontation and arrests that we saw [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=331.34s)]
*  But the administration relishes this they relish the opportunity to go after judges [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=338.18s)]
*  They relish the opportunity to try to intimidate and shock people [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=343.5s)]
*  They talk you know just gleefully about impeaching judges they disagree with so it is part of a broader [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=347.74s)]
*  Assault on the rule of law a broader and effort to intimidate they're intimidating the universities [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=355.82s)]
*  They're intimidating the law firms. They're intimidating corporations forcing them to come hat-and-hand begging for exemptions from tariffs [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=360.94s)]
*  And now they're trying to intimidate the judiciary as well no question [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=367.97999999999996s)]
*  I want to ask you I mean you were you were the lead impeachment manager of course as we all know for Trump's first impeachment [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=372.26s)]
*  Trial we all followed it very closely you're on the January 6 committee [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=378.62s)]
*  I know this is maybe not your favorite topic [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=381.94s)]
*  But one of your colleagues senator John Ossoff said at a town hall that Donald Trump should be impeached basically saying his conduct [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=383.9s)]
*  This term has quote already exceeded any prior standard for impeachment. I mean you know the legal [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=390.29999999999995s)]
*  Justification obviously a lot of what he's done is horrific, but what do you think has it exceeded that bar? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=397.02s)]
*  Well, I really think we should not be talking about impeachment. We should keep our soul focus on [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=402.29999999999995s)]
*  Protecting our institutions the rule of law and winning the midterms [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=408.86s)]
*  What we should be really trying to do is not just make the case against Donald Trump right now [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=412.82s)]
*  In terms of the midterms and retaking the House and Senate [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=418.42s)]
*  But also making the case for ourselves [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=422.5s)]
*  I don't think it's enough even though he's doing this terrible job to rely on [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=424.82s)]
*  presidential self-destruction [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=430.62s)]
*  The thing that poll did not indicate is what are the Democrats numbers? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=432.54s)]
*  Yeah, and so I think we need to be focused on our own numbers as well and making the case for [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=437.38s)]
*  How we would be better stewards of the economy how we would not engage in this reckless terror policy [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=443.53999999999996s)]
*  You know seeing today the Treasury Secretary and say their terror strategy is strategic uncertainty [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=449.94s)]
*  What the hell is that? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=456.46s)]
*  With tariffs you want to be certain you want to have some certainty some predictability uncertainty is the worst [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=459.58s)]
*  So but but I would love to see Democrats out there [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=465.3s)]
*  Advancing our own big ideas for me. It would be a housing boom [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=469.62s)]
*  I'd love to see in the same way Eisenhower built highways and roadways [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=474.14000000000004s)]
*  The Democratic Party be the party of building housing massive new amounts of housing to bring housing costs down and address homelessness [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=479.74s)]
*  And expand Medicare ideas like this that I think we need to be out there [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=487.58000000000004s)]
*  Raising our own profile and and positives with the public [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=493.34s)]
*  I think a lot of people are happy to hear that and that's one of the issues that probably hasn't gotten enough attention [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=497.38s)]
*  We're gonna take a very quick break. Senator Adam Schiff is sticking around [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=502.46s)]
*  You [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zsuh8YlaNk&t=522.38s)]
