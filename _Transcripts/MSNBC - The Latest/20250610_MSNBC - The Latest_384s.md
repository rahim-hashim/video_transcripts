Video Description: “The president wants these confrontations so that he can call out the military in other cities in America as part of his would-be dictator playbook,” says Sen. Adam Schiff. “And we need to be aware of what we're seeing in L.A.—this abuse of the military—we are likely to see everywhere.”

# 'Dictator playbook': Schiff warns Trump using L.A. as military test run
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4)
*  Donald Trump spent today making ludicrous and inflammatory claims. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=0.0s)]
*  He tries to justify sending the US military into an American city [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  against the wishes of the city's mayor and the state's governor. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=7.72s)]
*  California's two senators also weighed in with a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegsett today. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=11.0s)]
*  A decision to deploy active duty military personnel within the United States [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=16.32s)]
*  should only be undertaken during the most extreme circumstances, and these are not them. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=20.2s)]
*  That this deployment was made over the objections of state authorities is all the more unjustifiable. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=25.84s)]
*  Senator Adam Schiff, Democrat of California and author of that letter joins me now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=31.04s)]
*  Senator, are you clear on the legal authority, whether it actually exists, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  that's being claimed by the White House to send those 700 active duty Marines into the state of California? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=39.88s)]
*  I don't think the legal authority exists, and it's not clear that the administration has even articulated [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=48.24s)]
*  the basis under which they're doing this. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=53.64s)]
*  First, they said they were lying for the countermanding of the governor by calling out the National Guard on Title 10 authorities, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=55.92s)]
*  which require the president to go through the governor, not around the governor, not over the governor, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=63.32s)]
*  but also require things like rebellion, which are clearly not in evidence here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=68.08s)]
*  He has also relied sort of generically on his article to power as commander in chief. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=73.68s)]
*  Again, there are laws and the Constitution does not permit the president to call out the military [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=79.36s)]
*  against citizens of the United States or to call out the military for law enforcement purposes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  They keep throwing around the term insurrection because they may want to rely on the insurrection act, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  but they hope these highly charged terms like rebellion, like insurrection, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  can put some kind of legal gloss on the lawlessness of their actions. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=101.8s)]
*  And Chris, I think it all comes down to something the mayor pointed out quite rightly, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=106.36s)]
*  and that is the president betrayed the promise that he would focus on violent criminals who were here unlawfully. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=111.08s)]
*  He hasn't done that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=119.72s)]
*  He's resorted to these indiscriminate raids of workplaces, increasingly, I fear, outside of farms, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=121.55999999999999s)]
*  traffic stops, the Home Depot grabbing citizens and non-citizens alike and prompting protest, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=128.2s)]
*  which you would expect. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=134.84s)]
*  And because I think this playbook will repeat around the country, it's important we recognize this playbook [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=136.68s)]
*  Trump is using once there are protests and there are always going to be some violent agitators. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=142.12s)]
*  And, you know, violence has no place in this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  It ought to be condemned. It is condemned. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=152.44s)]
*  Anybody using violence should be arrested and prosecuted. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=154.56s)]
*  But the president wants these confrontations so that he can call out the military in other cities in America [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=157.8s)]
*  as part of his would-be dictator playbook. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=165.08s)]
*  And we need to be aware what we're seeing in L.A., this abuse of the military, we are likely to see everywhere. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=168.28s)]
*  Do you think there's reporting about sending tactical units to a variety of cities that are run by Democratic governors, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  that this is essentially a kind of provocation, that they're trying to recreate conditions of, you know, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=183.44s)]
*  the 2020 protests we saw in George Floyd and to produce a kind of causes belly for larger crackdowns? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=190.72s)]
*  I do think this is part of what they aim to do. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=200.08s)]
*  This began, this administration began with the pardoning of hundreds of people who attack police officers. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=203.24s)]
*  So in order to somehow reestablish their credentials as the law enforcement party, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  when they betrayed law enforcement in the president's first accent office, they want to somehow create this confrontation. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=214.88s)]
*  I think they would be delighted if we were a nationwide confrontation where they can somehow claim they're the party of law and order [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  when they are, in fact, the party of chaos and disorder. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  But I think that's part of what they're trying to achieve. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=231.32s)]
*  We need to keep speaking out in favor of peaceful protest against any kind of violence directed law enforcement, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=234.6s)]
*  but also against abusing the military this way. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=242.04s)]
*  We in California, like in most states, love our National Guard. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=246.2s)]
*  They're there for us in wind and fire and hurricane and flood. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=250.16s)]
*  We cherish our relationship with the Guard. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  Likewise, we have the greatest respect for the Marine Corps, and we don't want to see those forces abused in this way. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  It will only erode public trust in those important institutions. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=263.36s)]
*  The president, of course, has broken with tradition to create this unprecedented military parade in peacetime on Saturday in Washington, D.C. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=268.52000000000004s)]
*  It's also his birthday. He threatened today explicitly the use of, quote, I quote him here, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=278.56s)]
*  very heavy force against, quote, protesters. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=284.12s)]
*  The protesters of this would be met with very heavy force. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=288.2s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, this is kind of classic would be strong man kind of talk. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  He wants a military parade on his birthday. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=299.48s)]
*  It's going to cost us over 40 million for that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=301.52s)]
*  They're wasting over 140 million on this deployment of the National Guard when it wasn't necessary in Los Angeles. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=304.56s)]
*  This abuse of taxpayer resources, this abuse of the military, this use of the military to provoke a confrontation that apparently [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=312.76s)]
*  the president wants because he is just relishing a fight. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=322.0s)]
*  We have to recognize it for what it is. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=326.84s)]
*  In addition to a terrible abuse of military power, it is also degrading our military readiness in terms of threats around the world. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=329.0s)]
*  But also it's a distraction from the fact he hasn't done what he promised in lowering prices. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=337.68s)]
*  He hasn't done anything to improve the quality of life for people. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=343.24s)]
*  And after this, you know, big brawl he had with the on Musk, he's looking to change the topic. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  Senator Adam Schiff of California, thanks for your time tonight. Appreciate it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=356.96000000000004s)]
