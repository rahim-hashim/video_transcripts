# Trump retreats! 47 backs down from illegal 'third term' plan as pressure works
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ)
*  We've covered President Trump's attacks and the rule of law in many ways. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to look at something that came out, interestingly, in our colleague NBC's Chris [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=3.36s)]
*  — our NBC colleague Kristen Welker, I should say, her Meet the Press interview. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=7.8s)]
*  This is new. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=12.24s)]
*  And you have these questions about deportations, legal challenges, and Marco Rubio's comments [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=13.24s)]
*  that people, of course, inside the U.S. are entitled to due process. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=19.56s)]
*  Don't you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States, as president? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=28.72s)]
*  I have to respond by saying again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=36.68s)]
*  What you said is not what I heard the Supreme Court said. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=40.44s)]
*  They have a different interpretation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=43.32s)]
*  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear to serve, protect, and defend the Constitution [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=44.88s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=50.92s)]
*  The Constitution of the United States. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=51.92s)]
*  That is a constitutionally significant oath that the president takes, indeed, that all [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=55.62s)]
*  federal officeholders take. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=60.18s)]
*  So he knows, fact check, he must uphold the Constitution and the Supreme Court's rulings. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  I'll also note, it's very common nowadays to sort of paint Donald Trump with one brush [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=68.17999999999999s)]
*  and talk about everything being so terrible. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=72.25999999999999s)]
*  You'll notice something that also matters, which is he says, of course, he has to follow [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=74.5s)]
*  the Supreme Court rulings. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=77.82s)]
*  A low bar and a baseline, but others have tried to claim illegally otherwise. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=79.62s)]
*  He still knows that's at least a bad look, and he won't admit that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=84.48s)]
*  Now that's his oath. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  Welker also asked about a separate illegal plan. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=89.48s)]
*  And the context is, remember, Donald Trump didn't leave office peacefully. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=93.36s)]
*  He, according to many, betrayed his oath of office when he tried to steal an election [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=97.4s)]
*  he lost. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=102.44s)]
*  We all lived through it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=103.44s)]
*  There was a violent insurrection. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=104.44s)]
*  And he affirmed that violence with the unprecedented pardoning of every individual convicted seditionist, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  all of that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=113.68s)]
*  Then he said he wasn't joking recently after winning this election this year about ruling [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  past 2029, not joking he wants a third term. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=121.12s)]
*  That would be illegal and unconstitutional. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  The Supreme Court would not allow it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  But here's how he's now softening that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=127.9s)]
*  Are you seriously considering a third term, Mr. President, even though it's prohibited [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=132.0s)]
*  by the Constitution? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=137.08s)]
*  Or is this about staying politically viable? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=138.16s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=140.28s)]
*  So many people want me to do it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=142.52s)]
*  I have never had requests so strong as that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=144.28s)]
*  But it's something that, to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=148.28s)]
*  I don't know if that's constitutional that they're not allowing you to do it or anything [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=152.08s)]
*  else. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=155.88s)]
*  But there are many people selling the 2028 hat. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=156.88s)]
*  But this is not something I'm looking to do. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=160.52s)]
*  I'm looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=162.44s)]
*  a great Republican to carry it forward. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=169.76s)]
*  Donald Trump backing down. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=173.44s)]
*  If you take him at face value, if you believe he's telling the truth, he then would apparently, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=176.32s)]
*  as president, be unaware that it is the Constitution that bars a third term. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=180.6s)]
*  It is a constitutional amendment. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=186.64s)]
*  It came about after FDR did pursue extra terms during World War II. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  And then, to clear up any doubt, it was passed and amended through the Constitution. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=193.2s)]
*  So it can't be canceled by any Congress, any law, certainly not any president. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=198.2s)]
*  That's what it sounds like when, apparently, the pressure works and the president, who [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  isn't allowed a third term, finds that it would be risking a lot of blowback to keep [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=207.64s)]
*  talking about something he's not allowed to do. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=211.76s)]
*  He's also now, through this interview, suggested advance or rubio, could be the person that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=214.28s)]
*  runs in 28. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  That is fully legal and constitutional and perfectly fine. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  The pushback was strong. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  And there is a theme here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump and especially his aides push farther than we've seen even in his first [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=227.04s)]
*  term and let alone in traditional times. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=231.12s)]
*  But when challenged, we see that sometimes it works, the combination of what happens [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=233.6s)]
*  in court and what we still call the court of public opinion. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=238.44s)]
*  Indeed, on Friday, we convened a special discussion about this with some of our legal eagles. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=242.08s)]
*  And DOJ vet Andrew Weissman offered this advice. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=246.68s)]
*  If you want to be on the right side of history, you need to not be afraid. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=250.6s)]
*  You need to speak. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=256.48s)]
*  You need to be saying to people who want to use fear as a way to silence you that you [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=257.6s)]
*  still have a First Amendment right. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=264.24s)]
*  You have the right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=267.12s)]
*  You exercise it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=268.16s)]
*  And it matters. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=269.32s)]
*  With that high minded introduction, we bring in former federal prosecutor Joyce Vance. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=270.8s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=274.72s)]
*  Hey, how are you? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=275.72s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=277.88s)]
*  I understand, as you do, we don't want to give out awards for people hitting the minimum [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=278.88s)]
*  bar, you know, following rather than betraying their oath of office. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=283.68s)]
*  But also, you're such a skilled practitioner in this field, both what you did in law and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=288.12s)]
*  the DOJ, but also now, Joyce, for many years that you've been here in the public legal [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=293.36s)]
*  commentary environment. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=298.68s)]
*  And what happens in public can matter in America. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=300.92s)]
*  And it would seem that the public opprobrium, the rejection, not just from, say, the usual [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=303.16s)]
*  But really, in general, to Trump's saying he wasn't joking about wanting an illegal [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=309.44s)]
*  third term, best we can tell, that has pushed him back, at least rhetorically. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=314.96s)]
*  How do you see this whole evolution? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=320.08s)]
*  So I think you make a great point here that isn't being made enough, Ari. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  And it's that there are still guardrails for Donald Trump, but they don't exist inside [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=328.44s)]
*  of the White House. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  They exist, to put it precisely, in the court of public opinion. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=334.44s)]
*  And you know, like you say, there was outrage when Trump suggested a third term, outrage [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=338.56s)]
*  from a lot of different places where Trump might not have expected to see it coming from, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=344.0s)]
*  including former federal judges, including even some whispers from inside of his own [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=348.56s)]
*  party. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  And it's clear that he reacts to that, that he knows when a fight is too big for him to [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  take on, and he will back down. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=358.88s)]
*  He doesn't do it every time. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=361.84s)]
*  You can't always tell when he's going to do it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=363.35999999999996s)]
*  What it makes clear, and I think it's to Andrew's point from the tape that you just played, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  and he certainly is somebody who exhibits this in enormous quantities, people have to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=371.08s)]
*  be unafraid to speak the truth. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=376.16s)]
*  They have to be unafraid to tell a president that he must uphold the Constitution, that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=378.2s)]
*  he swore an oath to do exactly that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=383.96000000000004s)]
*  And so that gives us marching orders for going forward. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=387.52s)]
*  It's really important that we continue to have high expectations for a president of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=390.6s)]
*  the United States, not just modest ones. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  Well put. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=397.6s)]
*  Another one of your council colleagues, Melissa Murray, had this to say. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=399.92s)]
*  They attack the courts to undermine the court's trust with the public for when the courts [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=405.32s)]
*  actually do speak. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  They are attacking the whole prospect of the nationwide injunction, so it's going to make [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=411.3s)]
*  it harder for people to challenge the administration's actions. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=414.6s)]
*  They are subjugating law firms, and they are trying to attack public interest firms too. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  All of that is about reducing the amount of legal resources available for this fight. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=422.24s)]
*  It is not a coincidence. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=426.24s)]
*  This is a strategy to make the law no longer work for the people. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=428.62s)]
*  Joyce? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=433.68s)]
*  So I agree a thousand percent. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=436.68s)]
*  Donald Trump is attacking the third branch of government, the judicial branch, and you [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=438.64s)]
*  do that not just by attacking the judges, but also by attacking the lawyers. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=443.36s)]
*  Lawyers can't just wake up in the morning and decide that they want to issue an injunction [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=448.82s)]
*  or hold someone in contempt. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=452.65999999999997s)]
*  Lawyers have to bring lawsuits first. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=455.36s)]

*  So when Donald Trump attacks the lawyers, he's attacking the judiciary. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=459.26s)]
*  That's the only branch of government that has shown any will and any success at holding [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=464.14s)]
*  this administration in check. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__I6jrQ3aQ&t=469.42s)]
