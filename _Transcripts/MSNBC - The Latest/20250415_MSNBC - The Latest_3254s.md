# 'Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza’ with Peter Beinart | Why Is This Happening?
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM)
*  Hello and welcome to Why is this Happening with me, your host Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=0.0s)]
*  Today the day I'm speaking to you, there is news that the Trump administration wants to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=12.96s)]
*  get a federal consent decree, which is usually the kinds of things that say the Justice Department [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=18.32s)]
*  would get with a police department that had been engaged in a pattern and practice of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=23.0s)]
*  discrimination and abuse to oversee them, to make sure they comply and stop, you know, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=30.44s)]
*  essentially violating the civil rights of their citizens. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=35.88s)]
*  The Trump administration wants a consent decree with Columbia University, okay, treating Columbia [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=38.64s)]
*  University the way that you would treat a rogue police department with a federal structure [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=44.32s)]
*  of oversight where everything Columbia does has to go by this consent decree. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=50.78s)]
*  And the ostensible reason they want to do that is because of the pervasive anti-Semitism on [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=56.54s)]
*  Columbia's campus. The Trump administration has also issued warnings to a variety of other [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=64.86s)]
*  universities, including my alma mater, Brown, saying that they will forfeit hundreds of millions [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=71.14s)]
*  of dollars in federal grants unless they address anti-Semitism on their campus. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=75.82s)]
*  And these allegations of anti-Semitism on campus stem from student protest activity in the wake [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=79.61999999999999s)]
*  of the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent bombing of Gaza by the Israeli military. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=86.82s)]
*  I have seen a lot of Jews I know alarmed, to say the least, at the, I think it's fair to say, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=92.97999999999999s)]
*  insanely cynical instrumentalization of anti-Semitism as a tool to pursue the destruction [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=106.22s)]
*  of American higher education, which pretty clearly seems like the aim of the Trump administration, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=113.82s)]
*  given the fact that there's a bunch of other universities that are attacking [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=119.41999999999999s)]
*  for having nothing to do with anti-Semitism. $800 million in grants to Johns Hopkins University [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=122.61999999999999s)]
*  have been canceled by the Trump administration with no explanation, having to do anything [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=127.74s)]
*  whatsoever. So it seems to a lot of people observing that this use of anti-Semitism [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=132.7s)]
*  is pretty cynical. At the same time, it has been very clear to me for over a year and a half now [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=138.22s)]
*  that among Jewish Americans, the concern about anti-Semitism broadly and specifically the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=145.26s)]
*  atmosphere that Jewish students face on campuses is genuine, real, visceral issue. And of course, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=152.06s)]
*  we're now a year and a half into the war in Gaza, which has been one of the most brutal and deadly [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=161.42s)]
*  in recent memory, particularly per capita basis. And as we're in Passover season, I thought it'd [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=169.26s)]
*  be good to speak to someone I've known for a long time and read for a long time and admired for a [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=176.7s)]
*  long time. I used to disagree with a lot more than I now feel. He was kind of on the other side of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=180.94s)]
*  things like the Iraq war back in the day. But Peter Beiner, who has written a fantastic new book, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=186.86s)]
*  came out the same week as Siren's Call. I actually read it when I was on, like I took it with me on [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=193.10000000000002s)]
*  book tour and read it in a day or so on book tour. It's called Being Jewish After the Destruction of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=198.06s)]
*  Gaza or Reckoning. He writes the Beiner Notebook on Substack, which I subscribe to and I listen [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=203.82000000000002s)]
*  to as an MSNBC analyst. So Peter, it's great to have you in the program. Thanks. I'm really glad [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=208.86s)]
*  to be here. Maybe let's start with this, just your reaction to this use of anti-Semitism as a kind of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=213.42s)]
*  crowbar to gain kind of access control over these institutions of higher learning. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=223.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think as you said, Donald Trump is trying to create an authoritarian regime. So if you do [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=229.98s)]
*  that, you want to kind of cripple and domesticate the institutions that aren't under your control. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  So that could be independent media or law firms or parts of the federal government that are under [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=240.14s)]
*  your control. And universities are a natural target since they create dissent. They encourage [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=244.94s)]
*  people to have subversive thoughts about people in power. And Donald Trump has a variety of different [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  pretexts. And I think we can fairly say, right, that the idea that he's genuinely concerned about [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=254.54s)]
*  anti-Semitism, given that, for instance, in 2016, he ran the most anti-Semitic ad of any major [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=261.58s)]
*  American presidential candidate in our lifetimes, is probably not the best explanation. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=267.1s)]
*  Oh, you mean the one about the evil globalist with a big shot of Lloyd Blankfein? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=271.18s)]
*  Yes, and George Soros and Janet Yellen, who also just happen to be Jewish as well. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=275.74s)]
*  So I think to me, the question is, why is he using anti-Semitism as the pretext? And I think part of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=281.5s)]
*  it is because he knows that it's harder to rally opposition if he uses this. And this is because [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=289.34000000000003s)]
*  very prominent Democrats like Chuck Schumer have conceded the basic premise. They have conceded the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=296.06s)]
*  premise, A, that the Palestinian solidarity movement that has grown since during Israel's [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=301.66s)]
*  destruction of Gaza is saturated with anti-Semitism, and that universities have not cracked down hard [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=307.58s)]
*  enough. And Schumer says that in his new book. He's got a new book, too, about anti-Semitism. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=313.5s)]
*  I've also read that book, yes. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=317.9s)]
*  Yes. So if you concede that premise, then it's hard to kind of argue, because Trump is saying, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=319.5s)]
*  yeah, things are really bad, and we're going to get really tough, right? And so I think the problem [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=324.38s)]
*  is that a lot of Democrats and a lot of people in the mainstream, I think, have not been willing [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=328.94s)]
*  to challenge that premise, which is, yes, is there anti-Semitism on college campuses? Yes. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=334.46s)]
*  Is there anti-Semitism that sometimes comes out of pro-Palestine activists? Yes. But the data that we [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=339.74s)]
*  actually have from actual scholars who study anti-Semitism find that it is not highest on the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  left. It is far, far higher on the right than on the left. And that the notion that the inherent [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=352.06s)]
*  support of Palestinian equality with Jews is a form of anti-Jewish bigotry is just wrong. And one [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=359.98s)]
*  of the ways we knew it's wrong is that, as you know, Chris, there are tons and tons of Jews. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=367.58s)]
*  Jews are overrepresented in this movement on many, many campuses. But if you can't make those [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=372.7s)]
*  arguments, you're not well positioned to fight against what Trump is doing now. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=379.1s)]
*  Let's stay on this for a little bit here, because on this campus issue, because I think broadly, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=383.82000000000005s)]
*  I agree with you about most. We're broadly in alignment ideologically on a lot of these things, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=388.22s)]
*  although there's areas of disagreement. But I do want to stay on the campasing because, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=392.06s)]
*  you know, I've defended the campus protesters for a bunch of reasons. One, because I think largely [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=396.14000000000004s)]
*  in the main are animated by like genuine moral concern for a thing that we should keep our [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=402.86s)]
*  focus on has been one of the most horrifying civilian destruction that we've ever seen. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=407.26s)]
*  It's like Putin and Chechnya or Assad. I mean, it's at that level, right? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=415.98s)]
*  But I got to say, like, there definitely are documented instances, Frank Foer runs from the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=422.21999999999997s)]
*  Atlantic where a bunch of masked folks and kerfias come into a classroom and they shout down the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=427.34s)]
*  professor and they distribute literature saying, you know, stomp out Zionism with like a boo. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=432.86s)]
*  There's this thing of happening of occupying space and saying, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=438.06s)]
*  you can't cross this space, you can't enter this building, you can't enter this quad, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=441.82s)]
*  if you're a Zionist. And I got to say, like, when I see those examples or videos, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=446.22s)]
*  if I think about myself as a parent, if I had a kid with a kippah, who was walking across the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=451.98s)]
*  campus and getting confronted with that, I'd be pretty damn pissed. Like that seems to me pretty [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=457.98s)]
*  tough to defend these specific instances in which you're kind of creating some ideological [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=465.58000000000004s)]
*  threshold for passing through parts of campus. I'm curious what you think of that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=472.06s)]
*  Yes, look, disrupting classrooms, right? Disrupting speeches, irrespective of your point of view, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=476.94s)]
*  is just wrong. And I think students should be within reason, disciplined for that. I mean, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=483.58000000000004s)]
*  I wrote a column years ago, you know, criticizing the students at Middlebury when they disrupted [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=487.5s)]
*  Charles Murray to speak. I think the guy's written totally racist stuff. But if he gets invited [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=492.78s)]
*  through a legitimate process to speak, you let the guy speak, you can do a silent protest, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=497.74s)]
*  you can ask him hard questions. So I completely agree what that they did in that classroom was [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=501.9s)]
*  wrong. I also agree that you can't create spaces in the universities that have an ideological [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=506.7s)]
*  litmus test. Right, whatever they are. Even if it's not a Zionist, you can't say like, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=511.98s)]
*  no conservatives can pass through the quad or whatever. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=514.7s)]
*  Exactly. So that's right. So that's one category of thing. And I agree. And I think that should be [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=517.5s)]
*  respond, the university should respond to that. Right. But a lot of what's happening is in a [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=524.7s)]
*  different category than that. First of all, let's take the situation where a kid's wearing a kippah [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=532.1400000000001s)]
*  and they get yelled, someone yells, you know, I hate Zionists at them. Right. So first of all, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=537.34s)]
*  that's very problematic. It's also really important to remember that there's another [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=541.9s)]
*  form of bigotry that we need to discuss in this context, which is the bigotry that Palestinians [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=545.74s)]
*  experience, right? Because if their kids getting harassed because they have kippahs, which is a [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=550.4599999999999s)]
*  problem, and I wear a kippah a lot myself, I'm concerned about that. So does my son. There are [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=554.4599999999999s)]
*  also a lot of kids who are wearing hijabs, right, or wearing kaffiyas who also get harassed. Right. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=558.62s)]
*  And you know, one notices that one actually that the universities are not being subjected to any [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=563.34s)]
*  discipline because of that. The thing about one of the things that I've gone to many, many, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=568.62s)]
*  many campuses, and I spend a lot of time with Jewish students on these campuses, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=574.3s)]
*  there are one of the things that you hear a lot from Jewish students that really upsets them [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=578.7s)]
*  is that people make assumptions about their ideas about Israel, about them being Zionists, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=583.58s)]
*  because they're Jewish, because there is this conflation that exists between Jews as a group [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=588.22s)]
*  of people who actually have a pretty, especially in the younger generation, pretty diverse set [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=593.98s)]
*  of views, because one of the weirdnesses of this is they're Jews who feel hate the encampments, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=598.22s)]
*  and then they're also Jews in the encampments, right? But there's an association between Jews [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=603.4200000000001s)]
*  as a group and this particular ideology in this state. And it seems to me the critical work we [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=608.0600000000001s)]
*  need to do is to keep those two things separate. It is fundamentally wrong to ask any Jewish person [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=612.62s)]
*  to answer for the state of Israel, or to be blamed for what Israel does, or to make any assumptions [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=618.0600000000001s)]
*  about them because they're Jewish. But the problem in fighting against this conflation is that the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=623.26s)]
*  American Jewish institutions, right, the leading American Jewish institutions are making exactly [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=629.5s)]
*  this conflation themselves. They're not saying that being a Zionist is an ideology that a Jewish [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=634.22s)]
*  person can have or not have. They're saying that being a Zionist supporting Israel is inherent [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=638.86s)]
*  in being Jewish. This is what Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League says. So if we want [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=643.18s)]
*  to fight against this, which I think does cause Jewish students on college campuses real problems, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=647.5s)]
*  then we all have to fight against it. You can't have it both ways. And I think that's part of the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=652.62s)]
*  problem that we face in this moment. So, right, and then it's one step further, right, which is the, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=657.34s)]
*  the, you know, Schumer says this essentially, I don't think these are quite the words, but he [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=662.38s)]
*  basically says, he says something like questioning Jewish people's right to a homeland is per se [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=666.0600000000001s)]
*  anti-Semitic, which is to say like anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism. And there's been a lot of [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=671.34s)]
*  battles about this, right? So that like per se to be anti-Zionist is to be anti-Semitic. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=676.94s)]
*  Right. And I want to give the, let me give the strong Kate version of this. Like, okay, sure, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=681.9s)]
*  conceptually they're distinct, obviously. There's lots of anti-Zionist Jews. There's an incredibly [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=689.02s)]
*  rich history of anti-Zionism. It's funny. My, it's very funny because my eighth grader is reading [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=694.78s)]
*  The Chosen by Chaim Potok. Right. I read it in eighth grade. The defining battle in that book, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=699.5799999999999s)]
*  which is a fascinating book is between two Jewish boys who have this friendship whose [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=706.06s)]
*  fathers are on opposite sides of the Zionism debate, right? Of the creation of Israel. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=711.9s)]
*  Yes. So, so clearly it's distinct. Right. But, and also it's the case that because of the nature of [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=717.26s)]
*  Jewish American life and the degree, which it is bound up with Israel, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=725.26s)]
*  that like, if you're shooting a water gun at all the Zionists, you're hitting a lot of Jews. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=730.38s)]
*  I guess this is how I would say it. Right. Like it, there's something there that's not crazy to [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=735.4200000000001s)]
*  feel like there's something othering about this. Well, I think the thing that one has to remember [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=740.7800000000001s)]
*  is that there are anti-Zionists who are also anti-Semites, which of course there are. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=748.0600000000001s)]
*  There are also Zionists who are anti-Semites. Right. And in fact, I think if you look at the [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=754.46s)]
*  data we have about where anti-Semitism and Zionism cluster on the American ideological map, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=759.34s)]
*  you actually find that there's more overlap, arguably, between people, between Zionism, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=765.74s)]
*  people who really, really love Israel and actually don't like Jews very much. Right. Think about the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=771.02s)]
*  politics of Viktor Orban in Hungary. Right. For instance, or the politics of a lot of people on [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=774.62s)]
*  the right. They are ethno-nationalists. They admire Israel as one of the shining examples of [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=778.7s)]
*  an successful ethno-national state, which is they want in America. They want a white Christian [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=783.6600000000001s)]
*  state in America. And that leads them into conflict with Jews in America who don't want [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=788.14s)]
*  America to be a white Christian state. Right. So I think one has to keep that in mind when one talks [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=791.74s)]
*  about the overlap between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. One has to be really careful [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=797.42s)]
*  when one criticizes Israel and Zionism to remember that there is a deep reservoir of anti-Jewish [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=803.5s)]
*  tropes that exist in Western culture, that people, you know, Jews are running the media, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=809.98s)]
*  Jews are running the government, these kinds of things. One has to be careful about that. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=814.06s)]
*  One also has to be able to ask fundamental questions about the nature of a state that [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=818.6999999999999s)]
*  has been used to practicing apartheid by its own leading human rights organizations. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=823.5s)]
*  And the Jewish organizations, the established Jewish organizations say, well, you can criticize [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=827.9s)]
*  it, but you can't question the legitimacy of the state. Right. But in fact, when we feel that states [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=832.06s)]
*  are fundamentally oppressive, right, we actually criticize and question their political systems all [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=837.74s)]
*  the time. And we say they could have a better political system, one that is more fair to all [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=843.34s)]
*  of their people. Right. Whether it's China or Cuba or Iran or lots of places. And for Palestinians, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=848.38s)]
*  right, most of whom live under the control of the state where they can't even become citizens. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=854.7800000000001s)]
*  Right. This is not just quibbling around the edges of Israeli policy or thinking if only we [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=858.86s)]
*  could get rid of Benjamin Netanyahu. Right. You can't even gain citizenship in the state in which [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=862.86s)]
*  you've lived your entire life. That's true for most of the Palestinians. So that invites, I think, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=867.4200000000001s)]
*  a very legitimate debate about the nature of the state. You have in your book, which I really [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=872.38s)]
*  recommend people read, I would I want to have Omar Al-Kadh, who's got a book about Gaza from a [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=877.9s)]
*  sort of different perspective, but they're both very complimentary, I think. I think they're both [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=883.74s)]
*  relatively short and very easy read. So I would read them both. But you talk about this. There's [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=888.22s)]
*  this sort of thought terminating cliche that drives me crazy about the right to exist. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=894.3s)]
*  Right. Like questioning Israel's right to exist. And you have, I think, a very smart treatment of [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=898.46s)]
*  this. I mean, the thing I always think to that is like, do we think North Korea has a right to exist? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=905.82s)]
*  Right. Like does Iran have a right to exist? Like I guess it has the Iranian people have a right to [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=911.34s)]
*  self-determination, I think. I think that's true of the Kurds too, even though they don't get one. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=918.38s)]
*  But like the current Iranian government doesn't have a right to exist. It seems like a pretty bad [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=923.9s)]
*  one to me. Right, right. And yeah, the point I try to make in the book is actually the irony of the [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=928.6999999999999s)]
*  fact that there's this focus in American Jewish political discourse on demanding that people [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=933.9s)]
*  accept Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, is that Jewish tradition is very suspicious of [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=938.6999999999999s)]
*  states, right? They're at best considered a kind of necessary evil. When the prophet Samuel [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=943.9s)]
*  is asked by the people to go to create a state, he goes, you know, he talks to God and God said, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=950.22s)]
*  listen, if you want a king, you can have a king. But just let me tell you, it's not going to work [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=954.94s)]
*  out very well for you, because this king is really going to oppress you a lot. And to me, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=959.26s)]
*  as I read Jewish tradition, you know, the figure that has the right to exist is the human being, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=962.86s)]
*  because the human being is created in the image of God. And so then the state, what the Bible would [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=968.38s)]
*  call a king, what we would call a state, has only instrumental value. Its value is measured against [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=973.4200000000001s)]
*  its treatment of the human beings that are under its control. It can protect them, it can also kill [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=979.02s)]
*  them and oppress them, right? And if it's doing a lot of killing and oppressing, then you have not [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=983.98s)]
*  just the right, but the obligation to reimagine the state and try to think if it could do a better job [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=990.06s)]
*  of that, right? And as you're saying, I think we do that with states all the time, right? We imagine [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=994.78s)]
*  there will be some kind of country in China. But there are a lot of people, including I think Marco [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=999.26s)]
*  Rubio, who would say, we would like a different kind of state rather than the People's Republic [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1003.74s)]
*  of China, because we think it's oppressive, right? And so I don't see why it's illegitimate at all [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1008.06s)]
*  to ask those same set of questions about Israel, again, given that it has been accused of genocide [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1012.8599999999999s)]
*  by Amnesty International and genocidal acts by Human Rights Watch, and that there is a consensus [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1018.38s)]
*  among human rights organizations that it's practicing apartheid. Now, those are pretty bad things. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1023.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one of the things that is frustrating or difficult, I think, about this topic, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1028.62s)]
*  and I'd love to hear you talk about this, because you're writing a book that is making arguments, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1036.22s)]
*  in some ways, it's, you know, to everyone, but internally, communally, I mean, the book is called [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1041.34s)]
*  Being Jewish After Gaza. So your book is written for everyone, but it is specifically coming from [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1045.5s)]
*  your experience as an American Jew towards fellow American Jews. I actually think about you a lot, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1051.9s)]
*  because I do, I really do, because I am not Jewish, though I have family who is, I've been very [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1058.46s)]
*  blessed in my life to be very like embedded in Jewish life and culture, which has been like a [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1066.62s)]
*  great one of the great gifts of my upbringing, honestly, and something I feel very grateful for. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1070.54s)]
*  But it's different, it just is, and the way that people experience for instance, October 7th is [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1078.54s)]
*  different, their connection to Israel, like these things are different. You're writing to fellow Jews, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1083.42s)]
*  and you're living as a Jew, and I think about you a lot, because like I know you and I know [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1091.26s)]
*  your politics, and I know the worlds that you inhabit, Jewish school that your kids go to, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1096.14s)]
*  the synagogue you attend, you're a religious Jew, and like, you don't just have like, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1102.0600000000002s)]
*  minority views, you have views that are anathema to the vast majority of American Jews. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1109.5s)]
*  So can you just talk to me about how you ended up here personally, Peter Beiner, and what it's been [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1119.6599999999999s)]
*  like being you the last year and a half? Well, I mean, I think, you know, we're children, all of us, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1126.78s)]
*  I guess, of our religious traditions, but perhaps even more centrally, we're children of our parents, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1135.42s)]
*  you know, and so my parents are from South Africa, and my family was consumed when I was growing up [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1140.3799999999999s)]
*  to buy debates about apartheid, in which many of my family members were defending apartheid, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1145.5s)]
*  and not because they thought it was fabulous, but because they thought it kept them safe, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1151.26s)]
*  and my parents did not, and my parents made the decision to leave the country in part because of [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1155.5s)]
*  that, and that's, my father is no longer alive, and that's their moral legacy to me, and so that [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1160.38s)]
*  cuts deep, you know, and so I have to think about how I try to honor that legacy, and so to me, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1167.1000000000001s)]
*  this is not the position, as I spent more time in the West Bank, and I spent more time listening [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1174.8600000000001s)]
*  to Palestinians and reading Palestinian writing and trying to understand the Palestinian experience, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1179.5800000000002s)]
*  I was haunted by these memories, not that South African, Israel, Palestine are the same, but they [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1184.22s)]
*  don't need to be exactly the same, there's a system of oppression, right, and you can just, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1189.66s)]
*  it's there, it's undeniable, when you get closer, the closer you get to it, the more horrifying it [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1195.02s)]
*  is, you know, and so for me, I couldn't, I had to find different ways of thinking about what would [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1200.46s)]
*  be at the core of my Judaism, and I also feel grateful that I, in some ways, had to do that, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1206.3000000000002s)]
*  because I actually think that ethno-nationalism is not a particularly deep and fulfilling way [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1212.14s)]
*  of engaging with an ancient industry, you know, this behind me is the Babylonian Talmud, not all [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1217.34s)]
*  of the Babylonian Talmud has 37 books, these are, I don't know, some of those books, but, you know, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1223.82s)]
*  when I read and I study Talmud every day, and when I study Talmud, what I'm reminded of is not that [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1228.62s)]
*  it reflects my politics, goodness knows, it's weird beyond belief, because, you know, you're talking [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1234.22s)]
*  things written, you know, 1500 years ago, but it reminds me of how much bigger [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1239.8200000000002s)]
*  that our religious tradition is than the politics of this moment, you know, and it just reminds me [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1247.02s)]
*  that there's this, you know, Talmud is often compared to a metaphor, as compared to the sea, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1252.6200000000001s)]
*  you know, you swim and you never reach the shore, and I just realized that, like, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1257.66s)]
*  this is a tiny, this debate about Israel in this particular moment, our politics, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1261.02s)]
*  there is so much more to this, to explore, and so I have, as I've moved in a more dissenting way [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1265.42s)]
*  on this question, I've tried to root myself more deeply in other things that I think are older [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1273.26s)]
*  and deeper in Judaism than this, as a way of reminding myself that there are other ways of [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1279.8200000000002s)]
*  being Jewish, and actually ways that are more fulfilling to me. I mean, the irony here, of [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1285.1000000000001s)]
*  course, being, and one that you talk about, you just mentioned this before, about how the [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1290.46s)]
*  Bible, the Jewish Old Testament treats states with skepticism, is that, you know, the defining [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1295.1s)]
*  feature of Judaism, of the last, you know, between the destruction of the temple and the foundation [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1302.7s)]
*  of the state of Israel was a people that had been, that had no centralizing authority, unlike the [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1308.54s)]
*  Catholic Church, and unlike other institutions, and the Catholic Church centralized authority, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1314.86s)]
*  personally, as a person raised Catholic, don't think it was the best, like, don't think it was [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1319.58s)]
*  very good, actually, for the spiritual development of Catholics. What was striking to me in my [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1323.5s)]
*  encounter with Judaism was how different that was because of that difference. There was no pope, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1328.94s)]
*  there was no hierarchy, there felt like something that was just pure spiritually because of that, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1334.3s)]
*  that you could, you know, the idea of a minion, the idea that you could make a religious service [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1342.06s)]
*  happen in any place, that these ideas and this worship had traveled from Shanghai to Aleppo to, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1349.18s)]
*  you know, Sao Paulo to wherever, and had, and this was beautiful to me. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1357.98s)]
*  But one of the arguments that, like, Josh Schleifer makes in his book, which is excellent, too, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1363.42s)]
*  Tablet Shattered, is that, like, it actually is now a different era, that, like, Israel is the [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1367.5s)]
*  center of Jewish life and will continue to be in numerical terms, like, the temple's been rebuilt, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1373.5s)]
*  and it's a new version of Judaism with Israel at the center, and you're kind of on the wrong side [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1378.7800000000002s)]
*  of what is this new epoch. Right, and I, Josh is a friend, and I think it's a great book, but I think [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1383.0200000000002s)]
*  it's also, remember, it's important to remember that, I mean, what our tradition teaches us is [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1389.42s)]
*  that Jewish sovereignty often ends in tears, right? And, you know, and one of the, you know, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1393.9s)]
*  and in some ways, this is part of the reason that normative Jewish religious practice for such a [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1399.9s)]
*  long time until Zionism was to forestall an attempt at recreating Jewish sovereignty until [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1406.38s)]
*  Messianic times, right, was in some ways because, was a response to that experience, right? So, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1411.5s)]
*  it is true that the creation of a Jewish state has been a revolution in Jewish life, there's no [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1418.3000000000002s)]
*  question about that whatsoever, and that it exists, and Israeli Jewish society exists, it's very [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1424.0600000000002s)]
*  powerful, and I want Israeli Jewish society to not only exist, but flourish, but I think where I part [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1428.22s)]
*  company in like very radical ways with most other American Jews, certainly of my generation, I think [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1434.78s)]
*  my views are a little bit less marginal among people, you know, who are in their 20s. Yes, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1440.3799999999999s)]
*  I think the data reflect that, yeah. I think that Israeli Jews over the longer term are going to [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1444.86s)]
*  fare better under conditions of legal equality than under legal supremacy. This brings us to [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1449.74s)]
*  this practical question which is threaded through your book, right? And it's, I think, an urgent one [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1455.1s)]
*  that doesn't get enough credence after October 7th. If the point is Jewish safety, are Jews safer [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1462.22s)]
*  in Israel? Like, it's strange to me that this question isn't asked. I mean, Corey Robin has [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1470.6200000000001s)]
*  written about this, I think, in a pretty beautiful way where it's like, basically you've got, I think, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1476.8600000000001s)]
*  I think it's about 90% of the world's Jews live in two countries. They live in Israel, or they live [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1480.8600000000001s)]
*  here in the United States, right? And one has one model, and one has another model, in one their [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1485.34s)]
*  majority, in another they're a minority. One is sort of pluralism, although let's see how long we [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1490.14s)]
*  could protect that. And this question of like, where are they safer? I don't think the answer [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1495.5s)]
*  is clearly Israel, and yet that seems to be the answer that people come up with when I'm not quite [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1501.5800000000002s)]
*  sure the facts bear that out at all. No, in fact, one of the things I think I quoted in my book that [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1507.0200000000002s)]
*  was really striking to me that a Palestinian guy once said to me was that he was, he lives in the [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1511.8200000000002s)]
*  West Bank, and he said he was traveling Atlanta in an Orthodox neighborhood, and he saw Orthodox [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1516.62s)]
*  Jews walking to synagogue, and he said he did a double take because there were no guns. And he [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1522.2199999999998s)]
*  said, he thought, why are they not carrying guns? Because the settlers that I see are carrying guns [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1526.9399999999998s)]
*  a lot. And he said it's because they're not worried about someone like me, because the people who live [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1532.9399999999998s)]
*  around them have citizenship, right? I mean, obviously, Anna is not a bastion of equality, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1538.3799999999999s)]
*  everybody has a citizen, they can vote, right? And so, yeah, I mean, I think this is almost like a [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1543.1000000000001s)]
*  childlike point to make. But like, when you have a system of legal supremacy, which imposes a [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1548.22s)]
*  tremendous amount of structural violence on another group of people, that is going to put you in some [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1553.74s)]
*  peril, right? And, and now, there is an alternative path to safety, which I think one has to talk about [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1558.6200000000001s)]
*  as horrifying as it is, because it's on the table. And that path to safety is you totally destroy [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1565.74s)]
*  that other population in the way the United States did with Native Americans. And so then you don't [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1572.14s)]
*  have to worry about them that much, right? And so, okay, that's another path. And that's very much [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1576.3000000000002s)]
*  on the table in Israel. But if you believe that Israeli Jews are going to be living alongside [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1583.74s)]
*  Palestinians, the point that I would make is you're safer living alongside Palestinians who have [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1588.6200000000001s)]
*  citizenship and the right to vote and some chance to develop a better life. And one evidence we have [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1594.38s)]
*  of this is that Israeli Jews are much less afraid of Palestinian citizens who get called Arab [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1599.02s)]
*  Israelis. And there are a lot of doctors, there are a lot of nurses and pharmacists. And one of [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1604.3s)]
*  the reasons that Israeli Jews are not terrified to go on the operating table under Palestinian doctors [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1608.46s)]
*  and nurses when they're terrified to go into the West Bank is the legal regime under which those [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1613.66s)]
*  different group of Palestinians live. I've thought about this before and again, in debates I've had [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1618.86s)]
*  with friends of mine, like if you there are three categories, roughly, you could say of Palestinians [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1623.02s)]
*  that live between the river and the sea, right in the sort of contested land here. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1629.58s)]
*  Palestinian citizens of Israel who live within quote unquote, Israel proper, Palestinians who [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1635.1s)]
*  live in the West Bank and Palestinians in Gaza, right? And on a spectrum, I think you can say in [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1640.22s)]
*  terms of like, liberty, right? There's concentric circles there, right? Of Palestinian citizens of [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1644.94s)]
*  Israel have the most the highest amount of liberty and freedom, those in the West Bank beneath that, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1651.34s)]
*  and then those in Gaza at the very bottom. And it's like, well, where has most of how does that map [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1656.62s)]
*  on to where most of the violence has come from? Like, it's actually pretty clear, like, like how [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1662.22s)]
*  this correlates like clear as day that the folks who are the least who have engaged in the least [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1668.3s)]
*  amount of violence, right? Even though they would have the greatest capacity to inflict violence, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1673.98s)]
*  Of course, because they live cheap by Jail. Yes, right. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1677.98s)]
*  Exactly. Right. And I think it's, it's, it's if you de exceptionalize the Israel Palestine question, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1680.8600000000001s)]
*  which I think is really important, we can it does, it's not so hard to understand why, right? It's [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1685.98s)]
*  because those people have some mechanism for getting the government to for appealing to the [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1689.9s)]
*  government, which does not run through picking up a gun, right? And it's also worth noting, and then [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1694.7s)]
*  is that if we look at the, they can also vote the Palestinian citizens, which Palestinians in the West [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1701.02s)]
*  Bank and Gaza can't really for a variety of reasons. And if we look at who they're voting for, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1705.34s)]
*  right? They're actually mostly voting for political parties that actually are committed to basic [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1709.74s)]
*  principles of liberal democracy, right? Actually more committed than than the Jewish political [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1715.02s)]
*  parties. Yeah. And again, and I don't want to instrumentalize this too much, because one of [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1719.5s)]
*  the other things that I think is really important about your I mean, these are practical arguments, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1723.82s)]
*  but like, you're making arguments from both first principles of liberal democracy, and also from [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1727.1799999999998s)]
*  Jewish religious tradition. I think one of the things I found the hardest, and I'd like to hear [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1732.3s)]
*  you talk about this is, is hitting these walls of dehumanization on this. And again, I'm in a [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1737.26s)]
*  different perspective because I'm neither Palestinian, nor Israeli, nor Jewish, right? I'm [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1744.3799999999999s)]
*  just sort of a little bit of an outsider to this, but obviously when October 7th happened, I felt [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1749.26s)]
*  total obliterating anguish. And it was just profoundly rending of the heart to imagine it [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1755.82s)]
*  and to think of little kids even now is making me tear up as I think about it. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1764.06s)]
*  And I feel that way about all the little children that I've watched get slaughtered [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1768.3s)]
*  in Gaza. I mean, and we all have, I mean, we've all watched way I mean, and it's, I sometimes [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1771.98s)]
*  think I'm losing like my losing my mind that everyone's just watching this every [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1778.3s)]
*  goddamn day. Right. And it just doesn't like, it doesn't matter. It doesn't, they're not children, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1784.54s)]
*  they don't exist. Like, and I just when you hit this wall, it really makes me start to feel like [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1791.4199999999998s)]
*  something's I'm losing my mind. That's how I felt a lot. Yeah, me too. I mean, that was in a lot of [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1795.6599999999999s)]
*  ways really why I wrote the book. I mean, after I was watching, I was in Jewish spaces a lot and, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1801.6599999999999s)]
*  and that, you know, so there was a constant invocation of the people killed on October 7th [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1808.6999999999998s)]
*  and the hostages taken and it was beautiful. And they were humanized for us. And so often we heard [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1813.82s)]
*  stories about who they were, and their families and oftentimes relatives of came in to talk about [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1819.26s)]
*  them. So the PDs people's lives that we prayed for them again, I mean, every single week, we pray for [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1824.6999999999998s)]
*  the hostages. And, and yet, as I was moved to tears by this, like on many occasions, and yet in some [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1830.1399999999999s)]
*  ways it was precisely because that was so beautiful that it made it so horrible that there was never [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1837.74s)]
*  anything equivalent like that done for Palestinians. I it was often either no mention [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1843.66s)]
*  or a fleeting mention or some kind of mention with the implication that it was bad, but they [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1849.34s)]
*  that the numbers couldn't be trusted. So basically don't worry about it too much, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1854.78s)]
*  because it's probably not that many when in fact, we now know the numbers were much higher than the [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1857.98s)]
*  right or that they brought it on themselves. And basically, they're responsible for their own death [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1861.98s)]
*  of their own children, or and even when even even when it wasn't any of that, there was never a name, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1866.22s)]
*  never I never heard the single name of a individual Palestinian never learned anything about that [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1872.6200000000001s)]
*  person, right? At best, it was a faceless mass of people. And right, that's just, to me, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1877.34s)]
*  to me, what makes Judaism of interest fascinating is there's a inbuilt tension between a religion [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1883.5s)]
*  that is based on the metaphor of family, but also has a universal message, you have to hold that [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1889.18s)]
*  tension. And it's in the tension where there can be beauty and creativity. And I feel like what I saw [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1894.86s)]
*  was just a tribal creed in which the notion of a universal obligation in this case to Palestinians [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1900.4599999999998s)]
*  was being lost. And I kept going back to this quote from Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, he said [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1906.2199999999998s)]
*  during Vietnam that he could not pray, because when he opened the prayer book, the Jewish prayer book, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1911.1799999999998s)]
*  he would see images of people, children burning from napalm. And I thought, why don't we have [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1916.2199999999998s)]
*  religious leaders today in our community who speak and think that way about what's happening in Gaza? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1921.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's and I want to be clear here that like, I don't want to say something daft, like, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1930.0600000000002s)]
*  we're all created in God's image, and that you can sort of from that first principle, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1934.94s)]
*  like figure out the conflict, because like, it genuinely is complicated, and actually does [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1939.42s)]
*  drive me a little crazy people like, it's not complicated. It's like, it is actually quite [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1943.3400000000001s)]
*  complicated. It can be morally simple in certain terms, but like, it's actually like quite [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1946.94s)]
*  complicated. But I also do think that [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1950.6200000000001s)]
*  the inability of mainstream, and this I think is part of this generational divide, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1956.7s)]
*  a part of the divide in the Democratic Party. If you're on one side of this where what you [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1961.26s)]
*  see in the aftermath of the war crime and mass murder that was October 7th [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1969.42s)]
*  is a campaign of violence that the likes of which is really only undertaken by [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1975.1s)]
*  like Putin, Assad like figures, like just mass mass mass violence in you know, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1985.1s)]
*  that and that everyone just kind of like shrugs at it. The US supports it. Right. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=1992.7s)]
*  Right. And that you that people can't be moved to actually see the humanity in what's happening. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2000.7s)]
*  It's very alienating in some deep way, like it makes it feel like there's some divide that [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2008.78s)]
*  you can't swim across. And I feel like that divide is part of what's happening on campus. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2013.58s)]
*  It's part of what's happening between Jewish children and their parents as they get together [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2018.22s)]
*  and Passover. It's so alienating. It feels so hard to jump over that divide. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2022.3s)]
*  Yes, I think you're absolutely right. And I think the question really is, you know, I think one of [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2027.34s)]
*  the things that's happening here is that there's a language of there's a there's a language of safety [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2036.86s)]
*  and security that is strong in some elements of the Jewish community, especially among older people, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2043.8999999999999s)]
*  that simply makes it makes it makes it this kind of discourse impenetrable, because it would then [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2048.62s)]
*  ask force you to ask hard questions about what Israel's doing and about and about the roots of [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2055.34s)]
*  this violence to begin with. Right. Because one of the things that also frustrates me is that [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2061.26s)]
*  we have to be able to hold two things, which is the horror of October 7th, the immorality of targeting [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2064.94s)]
*  civilians period. Right. And the system of violence that existed. Right. Martin Luther King [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2070.94s)]
*  was not an apologist for black violence when he insisted in the late 1960s that people think about [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2077.98s)]
*  the context from which these riots were coming. Right. And so but so frequently in Jewish discourse [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2085.02s)]
*  and American political discourse, if you try to talk about what life was like in Gaza on October 6, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2091.74s)]
*  immediately you are called an apologist. You don't care. Right. But for me, it's precisely [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2097.2599999999998s)]
*  because I do care. And because I don't want Israeli Jews to ever be killed like that again, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2103.02s)]
*  that I feel like you could only actually move them towards greater safety. If you deal with [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2108.22s)]
*  the conditions and the crushing violence that Palestinians are experiencing. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2113.82s)]
*  Yeah, there's also this question about whether again, we're sort of moving back and forth between [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2118.38s)]
*  these sort of different frameworks of like pragmatical concerns, concerns and like concerns [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2123.82s)]
*  of the soul. But like one of the things that I said very early on, on the show, and again, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2128.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm just a cable news host, but when the war started was, it seems to me that the stated [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2133.1800000000003s)]
*  aim of destroying Hamas is not going to happen. Right. I'm no genius. I'm no military strategist. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2139.26s)]
*  I never even served. But just from what I've read a little, done a little journalism, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2145.34s)]
*  I've talked to some folks and I don't think and lo and behold, here we are. Here we are. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2151.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. You had like tens of thousands of lives later. And has the goal been achieved? Of course, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2155.5s)]
*  it is not. Like, of course, it's not been achieved because the goal can't be militarily achieved, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2162.2200000000003s)]
*  which was clear about every counterinsurgency ever fought, including all the ones the Americans [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2167.74s)]
*  fought during the 20 years of my journalism career. I know. And you know, and what was so [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2173.18s)]
*  was frustrating to me about the US media was that I think if we had just as a week and again, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2180.62s)]
*  I say this as someone who's, you know, you know, was horrendously wrong in supporting the Iraq war [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2184.22s)]
*  and wrote a whole book trying to understand how that heck I could have been so wrong about that. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2188.7799999999997s)]
*  And one of the reasons was we weren't talking to enough people who really knew Iraq. And we [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2192.54s)]
*  weren't talking after October 7th to enough Palestinians, right, who were saying, you know, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2196.54s)]
*  I wrote a piece they weren't just saying this would be morally wrong. They were saying it's [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2201.18s)]
*  not going to work. It's not going to work. Right. You can't be because even if you Hamas recruits [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2204.62s)]
*  from the families of families who've who have been killed. Right. So you've killed a lot of [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2210.14s)]
*  Hamas fighters and you have a new recruitment bonanza. Unlike anything ever seen, they're now [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2215.42s)]
*  reconstituting their weapons from the ordinance that Israel dropped on them, just like the Viet [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2220.62s)]
*  Kong did when we write like we could have learned these lessons. Right. And even if you could, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2226.14s)]
*  even if Hamas didn't exist, there were Palestinian organizations fighting against Israel long before [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2230.2999999999997s)]
*  Hamas. And there will be long after Hamas unless you deal with the roots of people's grievances, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2236.2999999999997s)]
*  which is their lack of freedom. And to me, the fundamental divide in this conversation about [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2241.5s)]
*  about October 7th about Gaza is always between people who center the lack of freedom in their [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2246.3799999999997s)]
*  analysis and people who pretend as if that's not important in understanding what's going on. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2251.98s)]
*  Right. And I should say two things. I say one, we should note there have been these [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2256.94s)]
*  big protests against Hamas, which are which have not happened in recent memory that there is, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2260.78s)]
*  I guess, some theory of the case here is if you put the maximal amount of pressure on the [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2267.42s)]
*  Palestinian people of Gaza, they will turn against Hamas. There are some people who have taken these [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2271.9s)]
*  protests as a sign. That's true. Although if you listen to the chants and you read the signs, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2275.66s)]
*  these are also protests against Israeli aggression. It's not like these people that [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2279.82s)]
*  are going to change their view about the occupation if they get rid of Hamas. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2284.2200000000003s)]
*  Right. Right. And also, first of all, a lot of the people who go to those protests get killed by [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2290.06s)]
*  Israel because it's actually very dangerous even to travel to a protest in Gaza. And secondly, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2294.2200000000003s)]
*  if you wanted to strengthen the protests against Hamas, you would say something like, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2299.26s)]
*  if you get rid of Hamas, if Hamas agrees to leave, then we're going to do good things for you. We're [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2302.7000000000003s)]
*  going to rebuild Gaza. We're going to. Israel's not saying any of that. Right. Right. In fact, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2308.38s)]
*  what Israel wants is the Trump plan to expel the people in Hamas and all those protesters from [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2313.82s)]
*  Gaza. To maybe South Sudan, according to some reporting. The other thing, let me say the other [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2319.58s)]
*  thing, though, because I think it's interesting. We sort of ended up in a place similar to where [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2326.3s)]
*  I started. Right. So basically, what I said in the beginning is if you think the Trump folks [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2331.02s)]
*  are serious about anti-Semitism, when really they're going after a university, you're an idiot. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2336.06s)]
*  You're a sucker. You're a friar, to use the Israeli term. And I think that there's a similar line that [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2341.18s)]
*  people feel about this question about, quote unquote, Palestinian freedom. Right. People on [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2348.54s)]
*  the other side of this debate from you. Again, and I want to be clear here. These are people that I [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2353.02s)]
*  know and love. This is obviously true for you, but this is not, you can't shake. This is not like [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2357.18s)]
*  there's some group over there. This is like totally interwoven into all of our lives. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2363.42s)]
*  People that I know, love, are good people, have good views, are brilliant, are well read. This [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2367.26s)]
*  is not like, I hate all the condescension that happens on this debate that people don't get it. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2372.3s)]
*  All of that said, one of the things that I think is a sticking point is the idea that [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2377.7400000000002s)]
*  Palestinian resistance in whatever forms it takes, including violence and including [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2383.26s)]
*  horrifying violence like October 7th, that the basic idea is like, look, the world hates Jews [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2389.98s)]
*  and they just find a reason. Right. And you're an idiot and a sucker in the same way that if you [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2396.78s)]
*  think the Trump administration is concerned about anti-Semitism on campus, you're an idiot and a [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2402.22s)]
*  sucker if you think what's animating this is some particularities of the legal regime of the occupied [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2406.7s)]
*  territory and not the fact that the essential truth of the world is that Jewish strength and [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2413.1s)]
*  Jewish communal life is loathed and people hate it and want to attack and destroy it. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2419.66s)]
*  So I guess I want to just say something about this question about the attitudes of people on both [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2424.94s)]
*  sides. You are a hundred percent right that there are brilliant, brilliant people who hold views [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2429.9s)]
*  antithetical to mine. You know them, I know them, but I will say this in my experience as someone [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2434.14s)]
*  who has spent my life in the Jewish world, especially on, you know, thought a lot about [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2438.46s)]
*  this question. In my experience, Jews who spend more time with Palestinians under conditions where [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2441.9s)]
*  they can actually get to know Palestinians as human beings, not a, you know, not a soldier in [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2450.06s)]
*  a checkpoint, but where you can actually have a human interaction, overwhelmingly are more likely [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2454.2200000000003s)]
*  to believe that Jews can be safe living equally alongside Palestinians than Jews who do not. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2460.38s)]
*  And so it is frustrating to me to constantly be told by other Jews that I am naive about [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2465.26s)]
*  Palestinians and then ask those folks, how often do you talk to Palestinians about politics? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2470.86s)]
*  Because I am a very flawed person. There is a lot I do not know, but I do it a lot, right? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2476.3s)]
*  And so this is frustrating. That frustrates me. I think that the Palestinian national movement, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2481.1800000000003s)]
*  when I, if I think try to de-exceptionalize it and look and compare it to other movements of [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2488.94s)]
*  people who were oppressed, right? You know, the IRA, the ANC, you know, other groups, I do not [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2493.34s)]
*  actually see it as really all that different. All these groups use a variety of tactics. Some are [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2501.02s)]
*  ethical and conform international law and are nobling. Some are really nasty and ugly, right? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2507.82s)]
*  I mean, the IRA did some really, really nasty and ugly stuff, right? But it still happened that the [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2513.7400000000002s)]
*  IRA after the Good Friday Accords was not blowing stuff up in London anymore because they did, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2519.58s)]
*  because they had a voice in government. And one of the things, actually, one of the great [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2525.34s)]
*  takeaways of the phenomenal book by Patrick Radden Keefe, Say Nothing, is that in pursuit of what, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2528.94s)]
*  to me, is a just cause, and I was raised to believe is a just cause and still think it is just cause, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2536.38s)]
*  which is, you know, self-determination for the people of Ireland, Northern Ireland, like, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2540.46s)]
*  there is a deep and profound dark pathology that comes with these kind of quasi-totalitarian [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2545.42s)]
*  militant movements that do, like, worse and worse stuff when they get drawn deeper into the circle, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2550.1400000000003s)]
*  which that book documents incredibly well, and yet they did come out of it, like. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2555.6600000000003s)]
*  Yes, absolutely right. I mean, look, even the ANC, which we hold up as the gold standard, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2559.02s)]
*  during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, they had to admit to the fact that they were [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2563.6600000000003s)]
*  torturing people in their camps, that they had this practice. You think the Palestinians treat [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2566.94s)]
*  collaborators badly? They had this practice in South Africa called the necklace, which was [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2571.66s)]
*  extremely brutal about what they would do to allege collaborators. There was no due process [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2575.5s)]
*  for that, right? And yeah, and what frightens me partly is, like, these things intersect with [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2579.58s)]
*  one another, right? So we want, Israelis, Jewish Israelis, Jews want a certain kind of Palestinian [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2583.8199999999997s)]
*  politics, right? You know, nonviolent, ethical, humanistic, right? But killing people at this [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2588.62s)]
*  scale, creating a situation where Gaza has more child amputees than any other place in the world, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2595.1s)]
*  even though it only has two million people, you're not fomenting that kind of politics. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2599.98s)]
*  These things play into one another. No, yeah, that is, I think, inarguable. And at this point, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2604.22s)]
*  though, you keep using this word, which I think is really interesting, because it also comes back [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2613.42s)]
*  to one of the central themes of the book, right? Like, de-exceptionalize, right? And, you know, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2616.62s)]
*  what's the foundation of the Jewish faith? Like, God gives the tablets to one guy and one people, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2621.66s)]
*  an exceptional one. They're called the Jews. They are, you know, in the Jewish tradition, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2629.18s)]
*  the first monotheistic face, although actually, historically, maybe not. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2634.06s)]
*  Oh, those are fighting words. Go ahead. No, no, I'm joking. I'm joking. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2640.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm just saying it is a little contested. No, no, as well as it should be. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2643.98s)]
*  But obviously, in the Jewish tradition, you know, the exceptionalism is, like, pretty foundational. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2648.3799999999997s)]
*  So you can say, well, let's de-exceptionalize. It's like, well, but that's a little bit at odd [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2654.46s)]
*  with the story. Right. But that's right. So I think one aspect of the traditional understanding [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2657.98s)]
*  of how people understand what it means. Yes. But to me, what's very important about these very [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2664.46s)]
*  potentially dangerous notions like chosenness, right, is that there are different ways to think [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2671.34s)]
*  about them. Right. So if you say, as I would think, Jews are exceptional in our tradition [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2676.94s)]
*  because we are obligated to a certain set of commandments, right, that not everybody is, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2681.82s)]
*  not everybody else is told they have to clean their house today and tomorrow and only eat [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2686.46s)]
*  unleavened bread. Right. Jews have to do that. So we are chosen to do that. And therefore, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2692.22s)]
*  perhaps we have a special relationship with God in that particular way. But it doesn't mean that [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2697.3399999999997s)]
*  there's anything inherently virtuous, more virtuous about us than anybody else. Right. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2701.3399999999997s)]
*  We have a special mission. Other human beings have other kinds of missions and other ways of [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2706.46s)]
*  getting close to God. And to me, the danger of any kind of exceptionalism, including American [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2710.2999999999997s)]
*  exceptionalism, is it moves from saying we have certain responsibilities or tasks that we want to [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2714.7s)]
*  try to achieve to saying that we have some kind of infallibility. That's where it gets dangerous. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2721.02s)]
*  Yeah. And I think, I mean, I have a much more intimate relationship with this with [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2725.98s)]
*  American exceptionalism, which I have a very complicated relationship to. I mean, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2730.46s)]
*  the other part of the exceptionalism part of this, which, you know, and you again, write about in the [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2735.2599999999998s)]
*  book at length is the Shoah, is the Holocaust. And the fact that like, you know, this is one of those [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2740.3799999999997s)]
*  sort of, you know, the bell curve meme where like the dumb guy and then like the sort of smart and [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2748.8599999999997s)]
*  the super smart person, right? And the dumb person, the super smart person agree on the truth. Like, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2753.8999999999996s)]
*  you know, one of the ways to understand all this is like, yes, you can do the whole history of [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2759.02s)]
*  Zionism and it's the sort of colonial antecedents and extremely problematic views of some of the [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2762.94s)]
*  people that were pushing for it back in the day. There was a very powerful debate within Jewish [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2769.7400000000002s)]
*  life across the diaspora about it. And in fact, it was the minority view for a very long time. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2774.94s)]
*  And then like, yeah, the Holocaust kind of settled the question. I mean, understandably, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2780.78s)]
*  like, it turns out there's no cosmopolitan pluralistic society you can comfortably live in [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2786.3799999999997s)]
*  and think you're going to be fine in without the possibility of mass extinction. And like that was [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2793.4199999999996s)]
*  that is the kind of takeaway for so many people. And I got to say, like, of all the arguments out [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2798.7s)]
*  there, that's the one that certainly gets me the most. Yeah, yes, I guess I would just I would say [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2803.9799999999996s)]
*  that that, you know, history changes, right. So the fact that on the one hand, yes, it's true [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2812.14s)]
*  that Jews who who went who left Germany, if they were, you know, in the 1930s, or Poland or wherever [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2820.46s)]
*  to go to Palestine, which became Israel, that that move saved their life, right. It's right to move [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2827.2599999999998s)]
*  to a state based on a Jewish state, a state of Jewish legal supremacy. It's also the case in 2025, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2832.62s)]
*  as you said earlier, right, that the Jews in America or Canada or Australia or Britain or [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2837.98s)]
*  wherever who are tiny percentage of their population who don't live in Jewish supremacist [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2843.02s)]
*  states who live in mostly Christian states where they have some modicum of legal equality [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2846.86s)]
*  are safer, right. And so I think that the question of safety is not there's not I don't think a [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2850.86s)]
*  universal truth that says that Jewish supremacy always keeps Jews safe, safer, right. Sometimes [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2856.3s)]
*  it does, sometimes it doesn't. And I also think fundamentally, one can't talk about the legacy of [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2861.66s)]
*  the Shoah without recognizing that it also has implications for we think about the rights of all [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2866.86s)]
*  human beings, and not only as a Jewish story, right. And so there are many, many, many, many [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2872.7000000000003s)]
*  Jews, as you know, who interpret the Holocaust exactly that way. But it's also true that many [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2877.5s)]
*  some of the most fanatical, zealous, devoted, devoted supporters of Palestinian rights, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2882.86s)]
*  Norman Finkelstein, Amir Haas, Sarah Roy, many of them come from families of Holocaust survivors, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2890.46s)]
*  right. And it's not as if their story is not a Holocaust story, right. It is all about the [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2897.1s)]
*  Holocaust. But for them, the story of the Shoah is you don't treat people that period, and we [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2901.5s)]
*  can't lose that. One thing that's been illuminating on this, the artist and writer Molly Krabaub [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2908.78s)]
*  is working on a book about the Jewish labor bond, which was this incredibly powerful and [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2913.7400000000002s)]
*  left-wing anti-Zionist group that largely met its demise in the Holocaust, not entirely. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2919.66s)]
*  And just in seeing some of the writing that she's posted, and then sort of following my own trails [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2926.3799999999997s)]
*  on this, because I think it's fascinating, it's pretty striking that you've got Jewish labor [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2930.2999999999997s)]
*  bond Holocaust survivors in the internally displaced camps in 1948, like having just survived, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2936.7s)]
*  still railing against Zionism and the foolhardiness of a Jewish state. And I'm like, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2945.02s)]
*  wow, that is striking to me that anyone who just gone through that, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2951.58s)]
*  could say things like, how the hell are we going to be safe if we go to another place, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2957.3399999999997s)]
*  you know, and have to become occupiers and have like, and it's pretty striking that that [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2962.3799999999997s)]
*  existed even adjacent to the Holocaust. Yes. And because again, the other critical [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2967.18s)]
*  part of the story is, you know, about this story of Jews in Europe, the Holocaust and the creation [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2973.34s)]
*  of Israel is the key other element of this is not just that Jews were not allowed to immigrate [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2979.5s)]
*  in when as the Holocaust was encroaching, they weren't even allowed to immigrate after the [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2986.7000000000003s)]
*  Holocaust, right? Many of those people who were in those displaced persons camps would be very [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2991.42s)]
*  happy to come to the United States or other places, but Truman wouldn't let them in. One of the [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2996.1400000000003s)]
*  reasons Truman supported creating the state of Israel was he wanted them off of German soil, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=2999.74s)]
*  so Germany could reunify, but he wouldn't let them in the United States. He was more, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3003.58s)]
*  they were more willing to let Nazi, Nazi sympathizers from Eastern Europe into the United [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3006.7799999999997s)]
*  States than Jews after World War II. I mean, one of the other, the sort of foundational beliefs that [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3011.9799999999996s)]
*  I think shines through in your book and that I think kind of we keep circling back to, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3017.8199999999997s)]
*  is that Israel as currently constituted, not in the imagination of say, the sort of foundational [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3021.9s)]
*  socialist generation, and there's big debates about the fact how that generation itself was [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3032.54s)]
*  itself shot through with supremacist views, etc. But I think it's fair to say that the foundational [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3037.58s)]
*  generation was more socialist certainly, and I would even say more liberal in the small, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3045.9s)]
*  classical liberal sense than the current state. And one of the things that I think [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3051.18s)]
*  I keep coming back to is just like, actually pluralistic liberalism is really good. It's [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3059.1s)]
*  kind of the best thing we figured out. We should try to have more of you here at home. We should [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3064.14s)]
*  have it in a state like Israel, which would mean every citizen gets to vote. People get to compete [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3068.8599999999997s)]
*  on the field of ideas and argue and debate and have political parties, and that that's actually [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3075.9s)]
*  the thing in the world that will keep Jews safe the most and lower the amount of general political [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3082.86s)]
*  and factional violence. And I think that's a belief you have that seems when you say it that way, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3089.58s)]
*  an obvious one, but is a very contested view these days, and particularly among folks who support [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3097.1s)]
*  Israel and think that liberalism as we understand it in Israel, which would be everyone in the land [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3101.74s)]
*  gets a vote, it would be essentially the great betrayal of the state's founding. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3106.7799999999997s)]
*  Right, and what I see is so horrifying to me as happening in the United States is that there are [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3111.8999999999996s)]
*  elements in the organized American Jewish community that are making common cause in Donald Trump's [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3117.66s)]
*  effort to destroy universities and really destroy liberal democracy, APAC supporting all of these [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3122.22s)]
*  pro-Trump congressional candidates. The ADL didn't exactly scream with horror when Trump went out of [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3126.7s)]
*  these universities, you know, because they've been demanding a crackdown. And so what you're really [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3131.58s)]
*  saying is we are so dedicated to quashing the pro-Palestinian political activism that we're [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3136.06s)]
*  willing to basically be complicit in destroying liberal democracy in the process, and you think [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3143.74s)]
*  that's going to work out well for Jews, right? I don't think it's going to work out well for us, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3147.8999999999996s)]
*  in part because I think these bigotries travel together. So you can't make a separate piece, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3152.94s)]
*  right? I mean, to me, the fundamental lesson of the Tree of Life shooting in 2008 is about the [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3159.74s)]
*  way these hatreds travel, because as you know, this guy didn't start out focused on Jews. He [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3164.2999999999997s)]
*  started focused out on the migrant caravan about that Fox News was telling was invading the country, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3169.02s)]
*  and then he decided Jews were behind it, and then he realized the synagogue was hopesting a refugee [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3174.2999999999997s)]
*  Shabbat. So a world in which of radical hatred and persecution and oppression of trans people [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3178.22s)]
*  and of the Hispanic people and of non-citizens and of Muslims and whatever, like that is coming [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3186.94s)]
*  for us sooner or later, right? And if you think that it's worth letting those people go to hell, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3193.42s)]
*  because you're in the name of stopping pro-Palestinian activism, I think it's not [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3201.02s)]
*  only immoral, I think it's actually also very dangerous for Jews. Peter Beinart writes the [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3205.5s)]
*  Beinart Notebook on Substack, which I subscribe to and learn a lot from interviews, a whole range of [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrafKenFiCM&t=3211.7400000000002s)]
