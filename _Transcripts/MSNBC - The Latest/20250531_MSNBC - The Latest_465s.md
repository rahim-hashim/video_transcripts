# ‘Everything that is not bolted down is for sale’ Fmr. DOJ attorney responds to Trump pardons
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc)
*  Joining us now, Liz Oyer, former pardon attorney at the Department of Justice, who was let [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=0.0s)]
*  go by the Trump administration in March after she refused in order to restore gun rights [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  to actor and Trump supporter Mel Gibson. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=9.48s)]
*  Liz, thank you so much for coming on again. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=12.32s)]
*  What is the usual process for a pardon? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=15.44s)]
*  I feel like we kind of understand how the process works that is arduous for a reason, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  but for the viewers. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=21.92s)]
*  So, the pardon power is in the Constitution. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=22.92s)]
*  There's a power that's given to the president to essentially show mercy to people who are [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=25.88s)]
*  deserving and who have earned it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=29.84s)]
*  And there are a lot of those people and there's a process for those people to apply to the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=31.72s)]
*  president for pardons. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=36.2s)]
*  They apply typically through the Office of the Pardon Attorney, which is a non-political [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=38.64s)]
*  office within the Department of Justice. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=42.96s)]
*  Historically, it's not at the moment. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=45.44s)]
*  And the office carefully reviews these cases, vets the applicants, actually does investigations [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=49.56s)]
*  to see are these suitable candidates for a pardon and then makes recommendations to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=55.64s)]
*  the president that are not political, not partisan, and not based on considerations [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=60.04s)]
*  of access or money or power. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=64.64s)]
*  And then the president has the opportunity to do ultimately whatever he chooses with [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=67.0s)]
*  the pardons. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=71.04s)]
*  But there is a process that's intended to be followed to make sure this is this is fair [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=72.04s)]
*  and legitimate and not completely politicized. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=75.92s)]
*  And to be clear, the power to pardon is an absolute power granted to the president in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=79.8s)]
*  the Constitution, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=85.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  So the president can do ultimately whatever he chooses. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  But typically the recommendations of the Office of the Pardon Attorney are at least considered [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  by the president. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  This administration is doing it completely differently. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=96.64s)]
*  The the non-political folks in that office are sidelined. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  I used to head that office and I was fired in March and I have been replaced by Ed Martin, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=103.0s)]
*  who is one of the most political people in the entire administration. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  He recently he tweeted just this week, no MAGA left behind in reference to the pardons [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=112.76s)]
*  that the president was issuing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  Martin seems to have the goal of using the pardon power to ensure that everyone who is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=121.2s)]
*  affiliated with MAGA, who has been convicted of a crime, can get out of prison, which is [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  a novel use of that power. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=131.08s)]
*  Liz, can you compare and contrast a little bit the pardons that have been given to, say, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=133.32s)]
*  low level drug offenders or, you know, prisoners who have shown great remorse, you know, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  and have spent years behind, you know, those kind of feel good stories versus the pattern [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  of these pardons going to political allies? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. So the clemency power was really at its high point under President Obama. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=153.16s)]
*  President Obama was the first person to use it really in a principled, systematic way [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=157.12s)]
*  to try to correct overly long, outdated sentences. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  And during his administration, he granted commutations. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=166.04s)]
*  So that's just a reduction of a sentence. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=169.24s)]
*  It's not a full pardon, but commutations to people who were serving mandatory minimum [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=171.16s)]
*  sentences for nonviolent drug offenses. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=175.84s)]
*  And many of those folks were serving life in prison for low level drug offenses. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=178.84s)]
*  So he did a ton of good by granting those commutations. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=182.68s)]
*  There are people who receive commutations who are out in the community doing really just [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=186.96s)]
*  tremendous things who would otherwise die in prison. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=190.8s)]
*  So that was kind of the height of the clemency power. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  And now we're kind of seeing, I would say, the very bottom, scraping the bottom of the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=197.12s)]
*  barrel. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=201.12s)]
*  You know, I want to play a couple of thoughts that we have from Alice Johnson. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  The pardons are in the White House and also Todd Chrisley, the reality TV star who got [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=206.6s)]
*  a pardon this week. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=212.2s)]
*  Yes, one of the things that I look for is rehabilitation. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=214.84s)]
*  That person is incarcerated. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  Have they rehabilitated? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=220.0s)]
*  Have they admitted, not only admitted, but are they remorseful for what they've done? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=221.56s)]
*  Even though this pardon has happened, I still was convicted of something that I did not [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=228.36s)]
*  do. Do I have any remorse? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  I would have remorse if it was something that I did. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  So there she is immediately contradicting her. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=237.96s)]
*  But it shows you that these aren't based on what you're talking about. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=243.84s)]
*  People who have been in prison or jail for a long time and said, you know what, that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=248.0s)]
*  damn I shouldn't have done that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=252.88s)]
*  Or at least says that say that publicly. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=254.04s)]
*  Yeah, there's actually a manual called the Justice Manual that has detailed criteria [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=256.4s)]
*  for who should be considered for a pardon. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=261.16s)]
*  And it looks at things like rehabilitation, remorse, exemplary conduct since the time [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=263.76s)]
*  of conviction. None of those things are being looked at here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=269.72s)]
*  I actually believe that Alice Johnson is somebody who's coming at this with good intention. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=273.40000000000003s)]
*  She is formerly incarcerated herself and got clemency during President Trump's first [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  administration and I believe really sincerely wants to help other deserving incarcerated [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=283.04s)]
*  people. But the problem is that it's really the politics and the money that are carrying [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=288.2s)]
*  the day. And that's just overshadowing all of the legitimate things that could be [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  happening. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=298.92s)]
*  And she also said that when she looks at these things, people who are going to be uplifting [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=299.24s)]
*  the president's agenda. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=304.2s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=305.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's that's a new take on it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=306.72s)]
*  I mean, the idea that that we're looking for other people who've been targeted in the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=309.12s)]
*  same way that the president has been targeted. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=312.8s)]
*  It's actually just factually wrong what's being said about some of these cases. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=314.76s)]
*  For example, the Chrisleys are claiming that they were politically prosecuted by the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=318.32s)]
*  Biden administration. But that prosecution was actually initiated when President Trump [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=322.92s)]
*  was in office in 2019 by a U.S. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=327.96s)]
*  attorney who he appointed. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=330.76s)]
*  Oh, facts are stubborn things. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=332.52s)]
*  They really are, aren't they? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=334.12s)]
*  I want to pick up on something. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=335.47999999999996s)]
*  We had Michelle Norris here earlier and she wrote a column for MSNBC on Generation T, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  this new generation coming up under Trump. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=344.28s)]
*  And I believe you asked sort of this question. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  Then it relates to pardons in that what we're seeing with the president, he's pardoning [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=349.4s)]
*  people and elected officials who are accused of a sentence with white collar crimes, tax [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  evasion and fraud and things like that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=359.32s)]
*  And so doesn't the president doing this normalize this criminal behavior? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=361.48s)]
*  Yeah, he's pardoning people, I think, in whom he sees something of himself. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  He sees some reflection of himself in his folks that he's pardoning. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=370.68s)]
*  And it is extremely unusual to pardon people who abuse their public office, abuse the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=373.6s)]
*  public trust to to commit a crime. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=379.0s)]
*  But Trump has done that over and over again during this presidency and during his last, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=382.72s)]
*  which suggests that he is trying to normalize that type of behavior. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=387.72s)]
*  One of the most disturbing ones that we saw is the pardon of this corrupt sheriff in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=391.44s)]
*  Virginia, who was actually selling sheriff's badges so that people could use them to get [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=396.28000000000003s)]
*  out of traffic tickets or to be able to carry concealed weapons. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=400.88s)]
*  And Trump is frankly doing the same thing. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=404.2s)]
*  He is selling the instruments of his office. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=406.12s)]
*  Everything that is not bolted down is for sale in this White House. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=408.52s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing with the pardon powers and with the people that the president [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  is pardoning. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=415.40000000000003s)]
*  And that gets to Generation T, which these these kids who have grown up during this entire [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  time that you're talking about, how could they not think that, you know, white collar [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=421.16s)]
*  crime, tax evasion and all this other stuff is normal and get away with it? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=425.48s)]
*  But when they behind end up in jail and they don't get a part of it, they might realize [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=430.0s)]
*  it then. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=433.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, if they but apparently if they give money to the to to the president through some [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=433.56s)]
*  thing, they could get a pardon. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=439.76s)]
*  Liz Liz, thank you very much for coming back to the weekend. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw2TmaxEXFc&t=442.28s)]
