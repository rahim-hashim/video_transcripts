# Ethics of this is ‘highly questionable’: Reaction to Trump defending offer of luxury jet from Qatar
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ)
*  President Trump is heading to the Middle East for the first diplomatic foreign trip of his second term, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=0.0s)]
*  snubbing traditional U.S. allies to visit the deep-pocketed monarchies of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=5.2s)]
*  And Trump has confirmed on True Social that his administration is preparing to accept a super luxury jumbo jet [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=12.72s)]
*  from the royal family of Qatar, writing, quote, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=20.88s)]
*  The fact that the Defense Department is getting a gift free of charge of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  temporarily in a very public and transparent transaction so bothers the crooked Democrats that they insist we pay top dollar for the plane. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  Anybody can do that. The Dems are world-class losers. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=42.08s)]
*  Well, Democrats say the move is unethical and unconstitutional. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=46.08s)]
*  But the White House press secretary insists it's all by the books. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=50.96s)]
*  The legal details of that are still being worked out. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  But of course, any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  And we commit ourselves to the utmost transparency. And we will continue to do that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=64.72s)]
*  Do you worry that if they give us something like this, they want something in return? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=69.84s)]
*  Absolutely not, because they know President Trump and they know he only works with the interests of the American public in mind. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=74.8s)]
*  I want to bring in former Republican chair of the House Ethics Committee, Charlie Dent. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=81.76s)]
*  And David Ignatius is back with us. David, do you agree with that assessment from the White House? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=85.52s)]
*  They don't expect anything in exchange for a jumbo jet. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=91.12s)]
*  Appearances matter. And they matter when foreign governments give enormous gifts to the United States. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  And in this case, it appears that Trump might be able to keep this plane after he leaves office. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=106.08s)]
*  There's a reason that the founders wrote into the Constitution what's called the Emoluments Clause, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=112.88s)]
*  which says that receipt of gifts from foreign governments require the specific approval of Congress [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=118.88s)]
*  because the founders understood being indebted or seen to be indebted to a foreign power was inappropriate. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=127.12s)]
*  I just want to note a second issue, Chris, that matters here, which is security. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=134.24s)]
*  Quite apart from the ethical issues, this is some of the most sensitive equipment that the United States government has [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=138.96s)]
*  when the president is in Air Force One traveling. Every bolt, every panel, every wire has to be secure. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=147.2s)]
*  And I don't have to cast aspersions on Gutter to think that people can get into those systems from outside [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  who wish the United States ill, who'd love to have the ability to capture those systems. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=164.64s)]
*  What the Secret Service will do to make this plane entirely secure if it's received, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  I can't imagine it. All they're going to have to go through. They're going to have to take it apart piece by piece. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, by some reports, it would take years. And then there were conversations about whether they could sort of ease up on that a little bit. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=182.0s)]
*  That's going to be a conversation moving forward. But let's talk about just the gift, Congressman. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  My understanding is members of Congress aren't even allowed to accept a fruit basket from a constituent for official work. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=193.44s)]
*  So can the president accept a $400 million plane, give or take, from a foreign government? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  And I wonder if this had happened when you were ethics chair, what you would have said and done. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=206.72s)]
*  Well, first, many members of Congress have gotten themselves in a little bit of trouble over the years [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=212.32s)]
*  for receiving gifts from foreign governments. And I can tell you they weren't worth $400 million. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=217.6s)]
*  They're usually talking more than $50, maybe a few hundred dollars worth. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=223.04s)]
*  And they had to report those, any types of gifts like that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=227.2s)]
*  And the ethics committee would tell them what they had to do with those gifts. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=231.28s)]
*  So this is rather unprecedented, as far as I can tell. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=234.64s)]
*  David correctly pointed out the emoluments clause, which says that elected officials can't receive [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  anything of value from a foreign government without the express approval of the Congress. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=245.2s)]
*  You may remember during the first Trump administration, he intended to bring the G7 or the G20 down to Doral, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=250.48s)]
*  his own golf course down in his golf club down in Florida. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=258.32s)]
*  And there was a big hue and cry at the time. And he backed off because it was clearly seen as [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=261.92s)]
*  some form of self-dealing, directing business to your own private enterprise. That was a problem. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=266.8s)]
*  Also, when we look at Qatar, you may remember, too, during the first Trump administration, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=274.16s)]
*  Qatar was being blockaded by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. And then President Trump, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=279.6s)]
*  at the time, supported the Saudis and the Emiratis at that time. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  So Qatar, of course, has a big base, American base there. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=288.72s)]
*  So I'm sure that the Qataris obviously want to stay on the right side of this president. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=293.12s)]
*  But the ethics of this, though, is really highly questionable. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=297.76000000000005s)]
*  The press secretary just said, oh, we're going through the legal details now. I bet she is, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=301.44000000000005s)]
*  or I bet they are, because I want to see how they're going to explain this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=306.88000000000005s)]
*  Because on the face of it, it appears to me this is a violation of the emoluments clause. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=310.16s)]
*  And I'd like to hear the clever lawyer thing that they're going to be [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=314.8s)]
*  rolling out shortly to tell us how this somehow passes legal muster and ethical muster. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=319.12s)]
*  Well, they have kind of rolled it out. A senior Justice Department official tells NBC News that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=324.16s)]
*  the DOJ's legal counsel prepared a memo. It was approved by the attorney general, Pam Bondi. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=328.72s)]
*  And ownership of the plane, as we've mentioned, is expected to transfer to the Trump library. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=335.6s)]
*  So there's, I think, two ways to look at this. OK, that makes it OK. Or it's really a personal gift [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=341.6s)]
*  that Donald Trump will be able to use once he's out of office. How do you read the idea that [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  there was a review of this by DOJ's legal counsel? Well, if the plane is not going to be used for [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=355.20000000000005s)]
*  personal use, then maybe it would pass muster. You might remember they took Ronald Reagan's old [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  Air Force One jet and it's at the Reagan library. It's just it's not used. It's mothballed. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=368.8s)]
*  I mean, it's not operational. So, I mean, if they received the plane and they weren't going to use [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=374.24s)]
*  it, then I suspect they could maybe get away with this. But from what I'm hearing, they intend to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=379.84s)]
*  use this plane after he leaves office for personal use, unless that's not true. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=385.36s)]
*  More to come on this. Former Congressman Charlie Dent, David Ignatius. Thank you both guys. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=392.64s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taf-07bghEQ&t=397.04s)]
