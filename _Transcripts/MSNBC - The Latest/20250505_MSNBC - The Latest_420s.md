# ‘He’s being disingenuous, he’s lying’: 9/11 responder slams Trump
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho)
*  Meantime today, 9-11 first responders and survivors are questioning the federal government's vow to never forget. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=0.0s)]
*  After a new round of cuts to the program, helping thousands of them who were exposed to toxic dust after the attacks. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=6.8s)]
*  The World Trade Center health program says 16 staffers were fired Friday, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=13.8s)]
*  and that in total, a quarter of the staff has been removed since the start of the Trump administration. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=18.6s)]
*  Advocates say it's an outrageous betrayal of first responders and survivors now coping with cancer. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=24.5s)]
*  But last night, the president claimed not to know anything about it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=30.3s)]
*  I was the one in my first term that helped them get money and helped them really live a much better life. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=34.8s)]
*  That was a very important thing I did in my first term, but I'm not aware of anything that may have been brought up. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=41.3s)]
*  Joining us now here in studio, John Field, ground zero demolition worker and the president of the Feel Good Foundation. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=47.8s)]
*  Thank you for coming in. You just heard what the president said. He's not aware of this at all. What's your message to him? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=55.8s)]
*  Well, Juan, thank you for having me. He's being disingenuous. He's lying. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=61.3s)]
*  The bill that he signed in his first term was the extension of the VCF till 2090 to coincide with the extension of the World Trade Center health programs in 2090. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=65.3s)]
*  One's health care, one's compensation. So he knows about this. He's lying. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=75.3s)]
*  This is a silly administration with uniquely unqualified people as secretary. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=81.3s)]
*  Secretary Kennedy's lying. He's being disingenuous and heroes and survivors are suffering because of their inadequacy, their recklessness, their poor leadership, their bad politics. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=87.3s)]
*  I can go on, but just. But I'd love to hear some details about it because what are the critical services that are at stake and who are the people who are being directly affected? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=99.3s)]
*  The two most important elements of the World Trade Center health program are to get enrolled and then to get into the program and then to get certified for your illness. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=109.3s)]
*  The people that were fired Friday night in that Friday night massacre late Friday night, they were in charge of that. Dr. Howard was reprieved until June 2nd. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=118.3s)]
*  He's the head of the health care. He's the head of the health care. He's head of NIOSH who administrates the World Trade Center health program. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=128.3s)]
*  So last month when he was fired by Dozier, Cut or whatever you want to call it, it was done illegally because the only one who could fire him is Secretary Kennedy, who said he hasn't fired Dr. Howard. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=133.3s)]
*  But Dr. Howard is sitting behind a desk with no choice to do so. We don't know Dr. Howard's faith on June 2nd. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=144.3s)]
*  And again, this is this just lacks humanity. These the lifeline, the World Trade Center health program is a lifeline to one hundred forty thousand people. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=151.3s)]
*  The backlog to get in before all of this was already a two or three month wait. Now it's going to be even longer. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=160.3s)]
*  And the longer we wait, people will die. And I don't say that lightly. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=166.3s)]
*  And can you talk about the emotional disruption staff being fired then in some cases rehired, not knowing if they're going to be fired again. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=169.3s)]
*  New members, as you say, who are unable to enroll. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=177.3s)]
*  What are you hearing from people who are directly impacted by this? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=180.3s)]
*  That they're trying to get in to see the doctors and they can't get an appointment or they're not being able to talk to the case workers. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=184.3s)]
*  The list goes on. Did they say to you, I'm worried whether or not I'm going to survive this? Absolutely. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=190.3s)]
*  You know, and keeping you know, we talk about cancer and one in three in the World Trade Center of Health Program have cancer. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=197.3s)]
*  Forty one in three. Forty thousand plus people have a nine eleven certified nine eleven cancer. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=202.3s)]
*  But we don't talk about the post traumatic, which is the most prevalent illness in the nine eleven community. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=210.3s)]
*  I was diagnosed by four doctors with post traumatic. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=215.3s)]
*  Those there are those who sit at home who can't digest what's going on right now, can't absorb the crap that we're witnessing and they're going to hurt themselves. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=218.3s)]
*  So they're going to hurt other people. These people are suffering. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=228.3s)]
*  And this administration is causing more pain and more harm to a fraternity of heroes and survivors that's uncalled for. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=231.3s)]
*  But, you know, to me, they're just trying to destroy every institution in Washington, D.C. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=239.3s)]
*  They don't know the nuances of the federal government. They're not smart. They're not bright. They're ignorant. They're reckless. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=243.3s)]
*  This is repulsive. This is repugnant. And as an activist, I'm disgusted by them. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=249.3s)]
*  But as a human being, I'm appalled that how we can treat each other, Republican or Democrat, does not matter. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=254.3s)]
*  You're a human being first. Act like a human being. Take care of these people. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=261.3s)]
*  And if you don't get out of the way so the next administration can. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=264.3s)]
*  Democratic senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, who represent New York, obviously, slammed the Trump administration for these latest cuts. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=267.3s)]
*  Here's some of what Senator Schumer had to say. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=275.3s)]
*  We think this is a disgrace. We think it has to be undone. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=278.3s)]
*  And we think our Republican colleagues have to up the ante with the administration as we are. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=283.3s)]
*  Senator Gillibrand and I are saying we will fight this with the advocates. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=288.3s)]
*  We will not let up on the pressure. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=294.3s)]
*  What more do you think Congress can do? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=297.3s)]
*  And we should say, obviously, the people who are involved in this program are not just New Yorkers. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=300.3s)]
*  No, every state sends somebody during the eight-month cleanup. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=305.3s)]
*  434 out of 435 congressional districts have somebody in the World Trade Center-held program. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=309.3s)]
*  As for Republicans, they need to grow, said Abe Lincoln, because I question their manhood and their womanhood, because their DNA does not allow them to care anymore. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=318.3s)]
*  The New York Republican delegation, led by Andrew Garabino, who's doing an amazing job, everybody else sucks at their job. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=327.3s)]
*  Because they're not fighting for the 9-11 fraternity, the 9-11 community, and those who are suffering because they had to met the 9-11. Shame on them. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=333.3s)]
*  Because if they really wanted to stand up and fight, they'd be standing outside the White House, banging on the door, saying, fix this right away. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=341.3s)]
*  I don't see anybody doing that. We've been in D.C. three times in the last two months. We're still trying to get a piece of legislation passed. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=348.3s)]
*  What's the reaction when you go? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=354.3s)]
*  Oh, listen, you know, we're at 50 cosponsors now for the legislation, because we have to get $3 billion for the World Trade Center-held program by 2027. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=356.3s)]
*  We're fighting two battles right now. We're fighting the boogeyman. And this administration is the boogeyman. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=364.3s)]
*  And it's led by people that are silly, that are grossly unqualified to be secretaries or to be president. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=369.3s)]
*  John Field, Americans who saw what was done down at Ground Zero, whether in person, as journalists here, had an opportunity to do, people watching from afar, I'm sure they feel your pain. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=377.3s)]
*  And they know what you did. John Field, keep us posted, will you? And thank you for coming in. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=392.3s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=397.3s)]
*  Much appreciated. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRd5YbFDZho&t=398.3s)]
