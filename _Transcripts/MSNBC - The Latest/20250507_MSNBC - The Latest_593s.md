# BREAKING: Black smoke at Vatican, no Pope elected
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg)
*  We have black smoke coming out of the chimney above the Sistine Chapel, meaning the vote has been taken. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=0.0s)]
*  There is no papal decision tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=7.0s)]
*  There will be another round of voting. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=11.0s)]
*  Claudio and Thomas, I know you stuck by for us, so thank you so much for that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=14.0s)]
*  Claudio, what is the reaction there at the Vatican? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=18.0s)]
*  Well, I can hear this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=24.0s)]
*  Probably you can still hear them. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=26.0s)]
*  There are thousands of people there that finally, well, probably that was more of a sign of relief because they were expecting black smoke. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=28.0s)]
*  They've been waiting around for three hours, a long time. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=36.0s)]
*  So finally the black smoke came out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=39.0s)]
*  Now there's clapping. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=41.0s)]
*  And of course the clapping is perhaps a sign of relief where they can finally leave and go back to their dinners before they come back tomorrow to watch out the chimney again. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=43.0s)]
*  But yeah, that's not a surprise, Katie. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=53.0s)]
*  Katie, we were expecting black smoke and we haven't seen a vote being elected after the first vote in modern history anyway. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=56.0s)]
*  But certainly, you know, another another historic moment here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=64.0s)]
*  First black smoke. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=68.0s)]
*  And then, of course, this is all we did. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=69.0s)]
*  The cardinals will meet once again tomorrow morning for two rounds of voting and then again in the afternoon for two rounds of voting and so forth until they elect the vote. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=73.0s)]
*  What time do they meet in the morning? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=82.0s)]
*  Italy time. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=84.0s)]
*  Around 930. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=86.0s)]
*  And then in the afternoon, if they don't elect the pope in the morning in the afternoon, it will be at around 430 in the afternoon. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=89.0s)]
*  And that is 1030 a.m. eastern. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=98.0s)]
*  And then, you know, we'll wait for that smoke to come out at around after the first round of smoking in the morning. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=100.0s)]
*  We'll wait for the smoke to come out at around six or seven a.m. eastern and then again in the evening at around this time. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=107.0s)]
*  And if we can just walk me through what's happening inside the Sistine Chapel, we've seen some images that were released by the Vatican of what it looks like in there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=115.0s)]
*  You have a number of rows, chairs, desks, and there's a notepad there for the the popes. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=124.0s)]
*  How does the voting actually take place? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=132.0s)]
*  Is it it's my secret ballot and it's handwritten. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=135.0s)]
*  Tell me a little bit more. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=139.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=141.0s)]
*  So each cardinal has one ballot and on it they have written a legal, which means elect in in Latin. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=143.0s)]
*  And then they need to just write down with a pen or pencil the name of who they think should become pope. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=151.0s)]
*  Then they fold it in half and they have to one by one walk slowly to the altar, holding that ballot up high so that everybody can see it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=157.0s)]
*  Then they get to the altar under the last judgment of Michelangelo, where there is an urn. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=167.0s)]
*  They put them the ballot on a silver on a on a flat plate and then slide that ballot into the urn. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=173.0s)]
*  And that's going to happen one hundred and thirty three times. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=182.0s)]
*  That's the number of the cardinal electors. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=185.0s)]
*  And that's maybe why it's taking so long for black smoke to show up. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=187.0s)]
*  And then, of course, you know, you've got the scrutiny years who need to take note of those votes, count them up, and then they need to figure out whether anyone from the cardinal electors has reached that famous number of eighty nine. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=191.0s)]
*  That is the number of votes that a cardinal needs to become pope because that's two thirds of the votes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=205.0s)]
*  Katie Thomas, it does sound very much like the movie Conclave, but they really actually were able to approximate what it is like in the Sistine Chapel as the voting takes place. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=212.0s)]
*  Obviously, the drama and conclave is fictional, but the process sounds very similar. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=225.0s)]
*  Thomas, again, we were not expecting to see white smoke today and we are thankful that it is very clearly black smoke. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=231.0s)]
*  I know in the past it's been a little bit hard to tell. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=236.0s)]
*  Again, you know, there's a lot of different cardinals this year, a lot of new cardinals, a bigger number than in years past. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=239.0s)]
*  Tell me about the negotiations about where to take the church next. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=246.0s)]
*  I know Francis was very progressive. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=250.0s)]
*  Is there going to be a debate right now whether they want to continue on with that legacy or if they want to maybe bring it back to a more conservative bent? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=252.0s)]
*  Well, of the hundred and thirty three cardinals who are there, who are there ready to vote, Francis appointed one hundred and eight of them. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=260.0s)]
*  In other words, four fifths are appointed by him. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=268.0s)]
*  And so we presume they're people of similar commitment and spirituality and so on. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=271.0s)]
*  Also, by way of the first ballot, at least if precedent would tell would would tell us something that typically apparently cardinals often kind of flatter each other and they'll vote for somebody that they really know will never get elected. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=275.0s)]
*  But they want them to be able to leave the conclave and say, well, I got I got two votes for Pope. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=290.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of complementarity, I think, that goes around in the first in the first ballot or two where they're kind of voting for their friends. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=295.0s)]
*  But then after a few ballots, they'll start to get serious and realize that they've got to get to that magic number of eighty nine and that the accommodations are not very comfortable. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=302.0s)]
*  You know, they look more like weekend. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=311.0s)]
*  And do they enjoy being sequestered? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=314.0s)]
*  No, I doubt it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=316.0s)]
*  Also, their living quarters are very modest, especially for cardinals of the church. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=318.0s)]
*  I'm sure then some of them will snore and keep others awake and all kinds of things so that I'm sure the the human condition will be will be rampant there and they'll be delighted to get out of there eventually. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=322.0s)]
*  But it'll take a few more days for sure. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=334.0s)]
*  But as I said, the ultimate challenge is really to try to appoint somebody that's willing and capable of filling the shoes. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=336.0s)]
*  The shoes of the fisherman, as we used to say, but that's the shoes of Pope Francis. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=344.0s)]
*  I know Catholics believe I'm sorry to interrupt you. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=348.0s)]
*  I thought you stopped talking. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=351.0s)]
*  I had someone in my ear. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=352.0s)]
*  I know Catholics believe that the that God is with them as they are making this decision in the Sistine Chapel. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=354.0s)]
*  How much, though, do manmade politics get into this? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=360.0s)]
*  Well, the old Catholic theology, Katie, is that grace always works through nature. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=366.0s)]
*  In other words, God works through human through human agency. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=371.0s)]
*  So both are involved. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=374.0s)]
*  So I do believe that the grace of God is at work in the conclave. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=376.0s)]
*  But so is human nature and the ordinary and everydayness of life. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=379.0s)]
*  And so it'll be by a very human process that this leader, this pope will emerge and a lot of kind of debate and compromise and promises and and all kinds of things. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=383.0s)]
*  In other words, the human condition will will be will be alive and well there. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=394.0s)]
*  And yet, hopefully that's how God's grace can work through the ordinary and everyday of life as it typically does. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=400.0s)]
*  And so the we get a good pope out of it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=406.0s)]
*  And of course, we've had lots of poor popes over the last two hundred and sixty six pope. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=408.0s)]
*  Some of them would be rather embarrassing characters and what have you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=412.0s)]
*  So the human condition is alive and well in the midst of that conclave. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=415.0s)]
*  And yet, hopefully, by God's grace, we will emerge to a fine pope and a fine worthy successor, Pope Francis. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=419.0s)]
*  Membership of the church has been in decline for many decades now. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=426.0s)]
*  What does it need to revive itself? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=430.0s)]
*  Well, I'd love to say, well, get people to read my book. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=434.0s)]
*  That would be unfair on television. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=438.0s)]
*  What is it? What is the title in case they'd like to read it? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=441.0s)]
*  It's called It's called Faith for the Heart. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=444.0s)]
*  And it is a good book, even though I say so myself. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=446.0s)]
*  I've written many books, but but that one in particular is is appeal to the faith is an appeal for faith in our time. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=449.0s)]
*  And I still think there is the great possibility of living lives of faith. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=454.0s)]
*  I think how much people are associated and, you know, attending the local church and using their parish envelopes every weekend. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=458.0s)]
*  That has diminished and decreased. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=465.0s)]
*  But I think faith is alive and well in the world. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=467.0s)]
*  And most people need something to believe in and some way to behave and some place to belong where they feel at home. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=470.0s)]
*  And a good spiritual, a good faith community can provide that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=477.0s)]
*  But I do think that we're into the one scholar calls the afternoon of Christian faith. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=481.0s)]
*  And it won't be quite as vital and as vibrant, perhaps, or as a as plentiful as the early centuries of the previous two to two millennia. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=487.0s)]
*  But I think the faith will still continue and continue to give life in powerful and and important ways. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=497.0s)]
*  Let's bring in MSNBC Vatican analyst Deborah Luboff to the conversation as well. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=504.0s)]
*  Deborah, it's good to have you. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=508.0s)]
*  Talk to us a little bit more about the factors at play for for picking a new pope in this moment and and where you believe it's headed. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=510.0s)]
*  Conservative, progressive, more moderate. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=521.0s)]
*  What's going to happen? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=524.0s)]
*  That's what everyone's guessing, because at this point, as you know, the College of Cardinals and the Cardinal electors are the most diverse group and the largest group there's ever been. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=527.0s)]
*  Certainly one that builds on what they consider the strengths of the previous pope, but also if they feel there were other areas that could have been stronger or where there were weaknesses kind of compensate for that. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=536.0s)]
*  So we certainly will be watching what direction the cardinals are going. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=548.0s)]
*  But at the same time, it's really kind of a guessing game. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=554.0s)]
*  All right, just so everyone knows, the doors closed to the Sistine Chapel at eleven forty six a.m. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=560.0s)]
*  Here Eastern, so three hours and fifty minutes total that they've spent sequestered. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=568.0s)]
*  Don't know if they were voting that whole time. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=575.0s)]
*  Don't know what else was going on. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=577.0s)]
*  But we we do know that so far there is no decision on a pope. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=579.0s)]
*  As you can see, black smoke came out of the chimney above the Sistine Chapel, meaning no decision yet. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrzY49TJHgg&t=584.0s)]
