# BREAKING: Active shooter reported at Florida State University
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg)
*  We want to bring you now an update to the breaking news out of Florida State University in Tallahassee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=0.0s)]
*  Four people have been hospitalized there after the school reported an active shooting on campus an alert from FSU [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=4.92s)]
*  You said police are on the scene or on their way there and BC's George Solis joins me now from Miami [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Jim Kavanaugh is also with me. He's a former ATF special agent in charge and MSNBC law enforcement analyst [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=16.36s)]
*  George I want to go first to you. What are we seeing here? What do we know about what's happening on the ground? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=23.84s)]
*  Yeah, this is a fast-moving situation from what we can tell right now FSU alert is putting out bulletins and alerts [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=29.16s)]
*  They just posted one a few seconds ago saying this is an emergency message for Florida State University [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=35.0s)]
*  Tallahassee campus continue to shelter in place police have responded to an active shooter call at the student union [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=40.52s)]
*  Stay alert for more information [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=46.8s)]
*  This follows an earlier alert that they sent out about half an hour ago saying that an active shooter had been reported in that same [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Area saying that police are on the scene or have been on their way now [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=55.04s)]
*  We're starting to see some videos filter in through social media of people appearing to shelter in place in that large police presence [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=58.8s)]
*  We just heard back from Leon County schools [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=64.72s)]
*  Which is a school district around the campus saying there is a lockdown in place as well [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=67.2s)]
*  And as you mentioned officials are starting to report some hospitalizations about four is what we're hearing again [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  These numbers tend to be fluid they tend to change during these types of incidents [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=76.8s)]
*  So we're obviously going to stay very close on that reporting at the moment [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  But again, these alerts are starting to go out pretty frequently about this ongoing situation on the campus there again officials telling us that they have sent [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=84.28s)]
*  Not only law enforcement, but there's a fire presence there as well again fast moving a lot of rapid developments here [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=91.8s)]
*  And we're staying on top of all of it George. Thank you [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=98.28s)]
*  Please keep us posted as we get more details, but Jim as as much as this is coming together in real time [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  We know there's a shelter in place on campus. What are the conversations that law enforcement officials are having? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=106.64s)]
*  What are they asking students to do right now because unfortunately this is a scenario that is all too familiar and that these campuses prepare for [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  Right Ali exactly law enforcement wants the people to go back to their training all the students and the faculty on the campus [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=122.56s)]
*  This is reported in the student union building with such a large building there [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=128.8s)]
*  And a lot of rooms a lot of places that the shooter can go [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=132.72s)]
*  But people have to remember you can if you can get out you get out [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=136.6s)]
*  That's the first thing you flee if not you hide you barricade and you be quiet and don't let the shooter find you [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=140.02s)]
*  Just these things are usually over quickly and show you hide if you have no other choice no other choice [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=146.82000000000002s)]
*  Define to fight for your life, then you have to fight [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=153.06s)]
*  But remember they're usually over quickly the police now are there and you can work as a team with even the students that are [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=155.94s)]
*  You know in danger the police have three tasks. They have to locate the killer or shooter [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=161.34s)]
*  isolate them and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=167.3s)]
*  evacuate [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=169.06s)]
*  The students and faculty so that's their task and their first major task is to locate him [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=170.58s)]
*  So if he's in there quietly he's not shooting or something he's skulking around stalking around [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=176.02s)]
*  Students need to be quiet [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=181.18s)]
*  Just hang tight if you can give the location to the 911 dispatcher for the police to locate this shooter [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=182.68s)]
*  That's what you want to do, and you don't want to come out of your room or your classroom or your office [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=189.1s)]
*  If somebody just tells you to it could be the shooter so you got to make sure it's the police you should have [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=195.46s)]
*  You know police radios multiple voices you can you know call 911 if you're not sure just don't open the door [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=200.58s)]
*  Just stay and it'll usually ends pretty quickly so just be be tough hang tight listen for police commands [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=207.26000000000002s)]
*  Oh really important guidance George. I want to go back to you because you've got some new updates from the hospital [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=214.06s)]
*  Yeah, we're hearing of also from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=220.62s)]
*  Agency that they're saying that they're actively involved with the incident at FSU campus [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=224.14s)]
*  We are starting to hear some reports from the Tallahassee Memorial [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=228.06s)]
*  Healthcare system there that the situation is rapidly changing [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=232.26s)]
*  Which at this point could indicate obviously that the number of patients that they might be seeing could be increasing again [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=235.62s)]
*  This is all just very fluid and so we're going to keep a very close watch on this [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=240.94s)]
*  Some of the language that they're using is that they may not be able to confirm the number of patients that are going to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=245.10000000000002s)]
*  Be at the hospital there so again [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=249.26000000000002s)]
*  Read into that what you will but when you have a situation like this where you have at least four that are hospitalized [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=251.94000000000003s)]
*  It could be very telling of a situation that is rapidly [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=257.1s)]
*  Evolving there and then you get a number of other agencies that are starting to respond to the scene there again the last one [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=260.62s)]
*  That we've seen is FD LE so again [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=266.1s)]
*  This tells you just how this might be growing in scope there as this investigation continues to a fold [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=269.14s)]
*  George Solis Jim Kavanaugh. Thank you for your reporting [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=274.5s)]
*  We ourselves are making calls trying to get more information here about the active shooter at FSU's campus in Tallahassee [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=278.02s)]
*  You [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKX-7lrFydg&t=303.82s)]
