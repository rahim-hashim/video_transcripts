# National Security Adviser ousted weeks after ‘Signalgate’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k)
*  Joining us now, Sam Stein, managing editor of The Bullwork, and Vaughn Hilliard, NBC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=0.0s)]
*  News White House correspondent. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=5.68s)]
*  Gentlemen, welcome to the weekend. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=7.68s)]
*  Vaughn, since NBC News has this new reporting and you are NBC News, talk to us more. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=10.0s)]
*  Why is the president considering keeping Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the job of national [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=15.76s)]
*  security advisor for a long-term period when he's already acting director of USAID, acting [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=20.88s)]
*  national archivist of the United States, and now acting national security advisor? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=29.12s)]
*  Man has more jobs than Jonathan Capehart. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=34.8s)]
*  And now, congrats on your guys' new job. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  Thanks for having us here for the launch. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=39.44s)]
*  This is exciting. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=40.72s)]
*  And look, for Marco Rubio, this is an evolution, right? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=41.72s)]
*  Since all of us first met, right, when he was back in 2016 calling him a third-world [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  strongman to now suddenly getting to the point here where even MAGA loyalists are seeing [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=48.44s)]
*  who will go to whatever lengths it takes to go and fulfill the foreign policy agenda of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=55.32s)]
*  the president is really telling. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=61.24s)]
*  I was talking with a diplomat from a Middle East country here this week who told me that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  initially when he came on board as Secretary of State, his country's view was to ignore [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=67.72s)]
*  Marco Rubio because they thought Steve Witkoff, Suzy Wiles, they were the ones with the direct [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=72.84s)]
*  ear. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=77.2s)]
*  But increasingly as time has gone by, they have found him to increasingly have a greater [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=78.2s)]
*  voice inside of the White House with a big State Department team with embassies across [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=81.88s)]
*  the country. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  And this is suddenly a moment for Marco Rubio where the president is giving him a greater [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  voice within the White House. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=91.8s)]
*  Well, Sam, is this an example of like Rubio's rise or is it just more of the chaos that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=93.0s)]
*  we've seen in the Trump world? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=98.6s)]
*  And like Jonathan was saying, all of those jobs, the national security advisor is someone [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  who has to be in the White House all the time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  The Secretary of State is allegedly supposed to be around the world doing those kinds of [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=108.16s)]
*  things. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, how could you go to Vaughn first? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  Because we know we start with the... [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=114.72s)]
*  We have to start in the house. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=117.64s)]
*  Welcome to the new game tab. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=118.64s)]
*  He's younger. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=119.64s)]
*  No. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=120.64s)]
*  Just to... [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=121.64s)]
*  You hold down already, you've got to give me something to write. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=122.64s)]
*  I was so looking forward to being the first. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=127.64s)]
*  More technically, I was seated first. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=129.64s)]
*  I think what's happening here is in a way it's kind of classically Trump, right? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=133.36s)]
*  It's like, you know, are we rearranging the deck, the chairs on the Titanic? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  Does it matter, right? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, Trump is always going to be his own boss. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  But there is something somewhat more interesting happening. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=145.18s)]
*  And you mentioned Steve Witkoff. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=148.4s)]
*  They've kind of farmed out some of the biggest foreign policy tasks to Witkoff, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=150.56s)]
*  He's the one who was talking with Putin, trying to negotiate this Ukraine deal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=155.36s)]
*  He's kind of dispatched to all these hot spots around the world. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  And those are traditionally the purview of the secretary of state. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=161.24s)]
*  Not saying that Marco Rubio has nothing going on at Foggy Bottom. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  There's a lot going on. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=165.88s)]
*  And don't rule out the archivist job. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=166.88s)]
*  That is very intense, okay? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  But it's very unconventional. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=171.4s)]
*  It doesn't seem practical. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  Certainly it's a lot on one person's plate. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=177.0s)]
*  And it seems likely that things will fall through the cracks because of it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=179.08s)]
*  But Trump kind of goes by his own beat. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  And he doesn't trust that many people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  And so even when you see the replacements, oh, we'll bring in Stephen Miller. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=187.8s)]
*  It's like, well, yeah, Stephen Miller's got the Homeland Security immigration portfolio. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=190.92s)]
*  It's like, what are we doing here? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=194.32s)]
*  There surely has to be a bigger bench. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=196.0s)]
*  But this is very much Trump. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=198.0s)]
*  And people who've been his biographer note that this is how he operated in the private [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=199.32s)]
*  sector too. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=203.4s)]
*  It's just a small group of people that he trusts and that he puts in different positions. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=204.4s)]
*  And they kind of rotate in and out. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=207.0s)]
*  There's one outsized voice that we haven't talked about yet. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=209.24s)]
*  Sorry, Sam. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to go back to Vaughn. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  Look, the point was the first. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  You can go to Vaughn now as much as you want. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  Vaughn, you've been following this advisor in particular since your Iowa days in 2015. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  Let's talk about Stephen Miller. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=225.0s)]
*  And if the national security advisor is truly a person who is a reflection of the president's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=226.0s)]
*  policies and style, isn't Stephen Miller possibly the most fitting pick here, even though he [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=231.16000000000003s)]
*  does not have a foreign policy portfolio at the moment, at least? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  Totally. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  And why in large part? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, who's been around Donald Trump politically for the last decade? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  Stephen Miller. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=247.24s)]
*  He's been a part time coming up with other names. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  Go back to 2015, 2016. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=250.56s)]
*  There's really nobody else around. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=252.04000000000002s)]
*  Boris Epstein, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=254.0s)]
*  And when you're looking at Stephen Miller, he's still, just last week in Michigan, earlier [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=255.84s)]
*  this week, celebrating their 100 days. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=259.64s)]
*  Who did he invite onto stage? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=261.6s)]
*  None other than his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, because he, with his full-throated, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=263.8s)]
*  you know, deep emotional ideology of the MAGA agenda, he is somebody that carries that out [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=269.36s)]
*  And when you look at the first administration, right, he went through four different national [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=278.48s)]
*  security advisors, and it's notable that he has Mike Waltz going into being UN ambassador, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  because if you look back at some of the old quotes, you know, as soon as H.R. McMaster [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=286.24s)]
*  left his national security advisor, he said that, quote, Trump's insecurity made him susceptible [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=290.16s)]
*  to manipulation. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  Trump's insecurity made him vulnerable to tragic results. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  This go around, Trump does not want any of those types of voices within his administration. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  So given what you just said about Stephen Miller, then why, and, you know, him being [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=303.76000000000005s)]
*  around the president all this time, why not make Stephen Miller the national security [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=308.68s)]
*  advisor? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  Why is he going to stick with Marco Rubio for the long term? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=314.52000000000004s)]
*  I think in the case of Stephen Miller, I think he's somebody who is very comfortable in the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  staff role, right? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=321.48s)]
*  You are not tied and you have fewer responsibilities. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=322.76000000000005s)]
*  You can go and work on the Alien Enemies Act on Monday, and you can go and work on another [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=325.72s)]
*  DHS program the next day here. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=330.44000000000005s)]
*  So it kind of gives him that fluidity to move around. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=333.2s)]
*  As national security advisor, you're overseeing the National Security Council, and you're [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=335.88s)]
*  going to be in meetings day after day. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=340.03999999999996s)]
*  And there's a certain responsibility with that, as opposed to just being by the president's [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=342.32s)]
*  side in the Oval Office. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=345.92s)]
*  There's a long list of reasons why Walz is out, right? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=346.92s)]
*  One, Signalgate was embarrassing for the president. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=350.4s)]
*  The president didn't see eye to eye with him ideologically. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=353.88s)]
*  He allegedly didn't get along with his own staff. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=357.91999999999996s)]
*  But I think the Susie Wiles of it all, the chief of staff, very powerful woman in Trump's [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  orbit, she thought he was dismissive, according to reports. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=365.56s)]
*  That I think was probably the nail in his coffin. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  But there are a lot of people who are wondering about Hexeth, right? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=373.8s)]
*  Because of the Signalgate, Hexeth has kind of come out the shiniest. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=376.76s)]
*  And we have, let's go to E-Sync. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=380.0s)]
*  The shiniest? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=381.48s)]
*  The shiniest? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=382.48s)]
*  If there's a shiniest, he's still there. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=383.48s)]
*  He still has his job. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=384.48s)]
*  He is still shiny. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=385.48s)]
*  He's still shiny. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=386.48s)]
*  Democratic senators asking why I ousted Walz and not Pete Hexeth. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=388.12s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=392.16s)]
*  We're going to focus on Hexeth. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  There's not a day that goes by that I don't hear concerns about Moroil in the Defense [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=396.32s)]
*  Department. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  What do you think his confirmation hearing would be like, I mean, considering what we [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  know about Signalgate? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=406.76s)]
*  I think it would be pretty brutal. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=407.76s)]
*  I think they're holding the wrong guy accountable. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=409.88s)]
*  What's Walz over do? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=413.16s)]
*  I mean, he's the guy who started the unclassified text chain when there were classified channels [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=414.16s)]
*  available. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=417.6s)]
*  It's his responsibility, but I also think Pete Hexeth needs to be fired as well. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=418.6s)]
*  So is Hexeth safe now? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  He's still shining. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=425.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=428.68s)]
*  Who knows if anyone's safe over the long term, but certainly in this case, look, two things. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=429.68s)]
*  One is I don't really think for Trump the problem was that they were sharing classified [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=436.0s)]
*  Intel on Signal. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=440.0s)]
*  Like I honestly don't think Trump cares about that stuff. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=441.0s)]
*  There's nothing in Trump's history to suggest that he cares about the stuff he put in the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=443.84s)]
*  bathroom in Demare Lago. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=449.28s)]
*  This guy's not the paragon of classified information virtue, whatever. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=451.08s)]
*  So I think the real crime was that Jeffrey Goldberg was on Mike Walz's contact list. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=457.91999999999996s)]
*  I actually do believe that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=464.55999999999995s)]
*  And I also, there's been contemporaneous reporting about this, but they didn't want to fire someone [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=467.76s)]
*  right away because they didn't want it to seem like Jeffrey Goldberg got the step up. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=472.0s)]
*  So they waited a little while. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=476.96s)]
*  And Mike Walz, who was the one who, and I still am trying to figure out what his explanation [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=478.84s)]
*  for was how Jeffrey Goldberg got on the phone. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=484.44s)]
*  Was it like, oh, I had a phone, but it sucked it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=486.24s)]
*  It sucked it into my phone. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=489.24s)]
*  Wasn't Elon supposed to solve all this? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=491.84s)]
*  Anyway, so that's the problem. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=494.04s)]
*  And the other problem, of course, is, and this is kind of underappreciated, I think, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=495.44s)]
*  which is that Laura Loomer went off on Mike Walz and believes that Mike Walz represented [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=499.28s)]
*  a faction of foreign policy thinking that frankly was antithetical to MAGA. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=507.47999999999996s)]
*  And that's not the case with Pete Hexeth. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=511.84s)]
*  It's very hard to figure out actually what Pete Hexeth's ideology is because it can be, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=513.92s)]
*  it shapeshifts a little bit. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=518.04s)]
*  Whereas Mike Walz very much came from that camp. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=519.4s)]
*  And so once you started having all those factors at play, then it was, it seemed pretty obvious [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=521.52s)]
*  that Walz was going to fall on the sort of not Hexeth. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=526.6s)]
*  But I think that's the problem. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=529.28s)]
*  And I think that's the problem. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGaBBrjR6k&t=530.28s)]
