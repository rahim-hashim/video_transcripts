# 'Like seeing middle school kids fight': Breaking down Trump-Musk's billionaire bond blow-up
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y)
*  It is the before the ages, a very public and very bitter feud between President Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=0.0s)]
*  After that onslaught of posts so far today, neither has hurled a single insult for hours on X or Truth Social, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=6.0s)]
*  each of those platforms owned by one of these two billionaires. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=14.0s)]
*  Well, things turned sour this week really fast for a reason that many relationships began to fall apart. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=17.0s)]
*  Over finances, in this case, Trump's one big beautiful bill. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=23.0s)]
*  But the feud quickly escalated yesterday into a verbal boxing match, and it seems everyone except them saw it coming. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=28.0s)]
*  It's not surprising at all that this is going the way it is. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=37.0s)]
*  How fast it's going downhill, it is pretty impressive. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=41.0s)]
*  I think it was doomed from the beginning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=45.0s)]
*  I think it was pretty predictable. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=46.0s)]
*  I just keep thinking like, I can't believe this is real life right now sometimes. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=48.0s)]
*  It's kind of like seeing middle school kids fight. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=51.0s)]
*  Two rich men with two big egos, they can't coexist for long. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=53.0s)]
*  I think just with two very extreme, intense personalities, it was kind of inevitable. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=56.0s)]
*  The odds of actually guessing what's going to come next has never been as weird as now. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=61.0s)]
*  Let's start with NBC News Senior White House correspondent Kelly O'Donnell, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=67.0s)]
*  the Dispatch senior writer and Bloomberg News opinion columnist David Drucker, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=71.0s)]
*  and NBC News Senior National Politics reporter Jonathan Allen. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=75.0s)]
*  Kelly, where do you think stands right now this morning? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=79.0s)]
*  Is this billionaire bond really over? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=81.0s)]
*  Is Trump's red Tesla still parked outside there? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=84.0s)]
*  Well, a lot of wisdom in the words of those citizens, voters that we just heard from. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=87.0s)]
*  Where does it go? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=94.0s)]
*  Well, I did check a little bit earlier and there is still the red Tesla parked on what is known as West Executive, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=95.0s)]
*  which is the street between the White House and the old executive office building. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=101.0s)]
*  And so that has been there since the president purchased it after the sort of showroom experience [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=106.0s)]
*  when Musk had a number of his vehicles, Tesla's. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=112.0s)]
*  He's of course the owner of Tesla earlier in the term and it is still present. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=115.0s)]
*  A senior administration official tells me the president is thinking of selling it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=121.0s)]
*  So we'll see where that heads. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=125.0s)]
*  In terms of today, there's been an attempt by certainly officials here to tamp things down, to quiet the rhetoric. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=127.0s)]
*  Yesterday was a kind of like a summer storm that blew through. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=136.0s)]
*  And today they'd like it to be a little bit more focused on the underlying issue, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=140.0s)]
*  which is the big budget bill that the president has on the line. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=145.0s)]
*  Senate Republicans are working through it, making their changes. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=152.0s)]
*  It brings so many of the president's priorities to fruition. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=155.0s)]
*  And Musk is the one among a few other voices saying it extends the deficit too much. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=159.0s)]
*  It is too expensive. He had very specific criticism and we saw how that all devolved. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=164.0s)]
*  So it's a quieter moment. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=168.0s)]
*  Both men are using their social media platforms, but not about each other. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=170.0s)]
*  And of course we all know that that could change at any moment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=174.0s)]
*  But there seems to be an effort, at least from the White House side. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=177.0s)]
*  I've not had a response from Musk related sources who have not gotten back to me on where he is thinking right now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=180.0s)]
*  But from the White House side, I think they want to take a bit of a breather. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=189.0s)]
*  We don't expect to see the president much today. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=192.0s)]
*  He will leave later in the day heading to his New Jersey home. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=195.0s)]
*  So that'll be an opportunity when he walks to the helicopter. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=199.0s)]
*  Perhaps he'll have something to say at that point. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=202.0s)]
*  I mean, Kelly, we all have covered President Trump long enough to know that he's a man who beats to his own drummer and, you know, oftentimes acts on impulse. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=204.0s)]
*  Is there somebody there inside the White House who can persuade him to rein it in if his advisors and more broadly the administration feels they need to go into clean up mode? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=212.0s)]
*  Well, certainly what happens is there's a vigorous conversation where the people that he has put in places around him can certainly hash out what they think is the best course of action for the president. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=221.0s)]
*  Ultimately, he decides what he wants to do. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=231.0s)]
*  But when you look at what's at stake here, the president believes very strongly that this piece of legislation is sort of essential for his policy advancements. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=234.0s)]
*  And so he wants that to get done. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=243.0s)]
*  And there are certainly a number of things that making the situation worse with Musk don't end well. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=246.0s)]
*  There are lots of government contracts where Musk businesses are very intertwined in what the government needs to do and can do. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=252.0s)]
*  And so damaging that has a cost. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=259.0s)]
*  And obviously Musk has been a prodigious donor to campaigns. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=261.0s)]
*  And that gives him a separate power base, not being the president. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=266.0s)]
*  That's certainly its own central power base. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=270.0s)]
*  But he's a force to be dealt with. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=273.0s)]
*  And so President Trump knows that, knows him well, and will try to calibrate as he sees fit with the advice of those around him. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=274.0s)]
*  So the fact that we haven't heard more from the president so far is an indication that he wants to, at least for this moment, kind of slow roll this situation. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=281.0s)]
*  David, for President Trump, every relationship is transactional. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=290.0s)]
*  Where do you see this one heading? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=293.0s)]
*  I mean, who knows? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=296.0s)]
*  But, you know, we've seen this rodeo before. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=298.0s)]
*  Trump brings people into a circle. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=300.0s)]
*  Trump gets rid of people. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=302.0s)]
*  Trump brings the same person back into his circle. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=304.0s)]
*  It's entertaining, but it's really ultimately a sideshow. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=306.0s)]
*  I think what is interesting about it is not President Trump, let's say, being through with Elon Musk, because, again, we've seen that before. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=312.0s)]
*  I think it's Musk's naivete when it comes to politics. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=322.0s)]
*  If he thought that President Trump and Republicans in Congress were going to produce a reconciliation package or any legislative package that was going to materially take a whack at the federal debt, then he hasn't been paying attention. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=326.0s)]
*  As involved as he was on the campaign trail in 2024, he apparently didn't listen to what Trump was saying on the trail. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=339.0s)]
*  And Trump didn't campaign on debt reduction. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=348.0s)]
*  He didn't campaign on doing the sorts of things, for instance, entitlement reform, possibly mixing in tax increases to deal with the debt. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=351.0s)]
*  He campaigned on everything that is in this legislative package. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=360.0s)]
*  The mix of tax cuts for the wealthy and the middle and lower classes, the border security components, it's all in there. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=364.0s)]
*  So for him to all of a sudden discover that, wait a minute, these guys don't want to deal with the debt, he should have paid more attention before he wrote a check for $250 million. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=372.0s)]
*  I mean, not that he's going to miss it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=381.0s)]
*  But Trump didn't do it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=383.0s)]
*  People have all sorts of opinions about Donald Trump, but he's been doing exactly what he said he was going to do. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=385.0s)]
*  It's not like he owes Musk an apology. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=390.0s)]
*  Whether you like it or not, he's been doing what he said he was going to do. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=393.0s)]
*  John, what is the impact, though, on American lives if President Trump makes Musk's businesses suffer as he has been threatening to cut contracts and stuff? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=397.0s)]
*  Realistically, what could Trump do? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=406.0s)]
*  Well, for most Americans, I think it'll have minimal impact. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=408.0s)]
*  If you're invested in Tesla, that could have an effect. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=412.0s)]
*  SpaceX is a private company, so you're not going to see investors there hurt. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=415.0s)]
*  One electric vehicle company being harmed in the market is not going to prevent Americans who want to buy electrical vehicles from finding them. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=420.0s)]
*  That's certainly the trend that we've seen in the automotive industry of late. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=427.0s)]
*  So I think for the average person, it makes very little difference if Musk's businesses are hurt. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=431.0s)]
*  It makes a big difference for Musk, and it could make a difference for Republicans in Congress. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=436.0s)]
*  I think David's right about Musk's political naiveté and coming into Washington and expecting he was going to be able to eliminate debt. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=440.0s)]
*  The reason that we have a debt of $36 to $37 trillion is because that successive Congresses and presidents have found it much easier to spend more and tax less than is needed to keep a budget in balance. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=449.0s)]
*  But if Musk decides that he's going to go through with this threat to spend money to eliminate Republicans or get ousted Republicans from their seats if they vote for this bill, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=463.0s)]
*  that could be detrimental certainly to President Trump's attempts to keep control of the House. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=473.0s)]
*  Speaker Johnson was asked on CNBC this morning about Musk's claim that he's responsible for the GOP's House majority. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=479.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=486.0s)]
*  Elon was a big contributor in the last election, but this was a whole team effort. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=489.0s)]
*  I mean, President Trump is the most consequential political figure of his generation, of modern American history. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=493.0s)]
*  He is the one responsible for that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=501.0s)]
*  David, what could the breakup mean for the overall MAGA movement? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=504.0s)]
*  I'll note Musk has a new poll pinned to the top of his X page asking if it's time to create a new political party. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=508.0s)]
*  Look, if Elon Musk decided to take his resources and his voice on social media and put it behind challenger candidates and Republican primaries or even a new political movement, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=515.0s)]
*  that would be something to pay attention to because he has the resources to do it and he's got the media platform to promote it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=530.0s)]
*  So that's something to watch. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=537.0s)]
*  But the Republican Party, the MAGA movement, this is all about Donald Trump. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=540.0s)]
*  I think that if you want to know what's next for the party and for the president's loyal grassroots supporters, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=544.0s)]
*  let's talk about who the Republican nominee is going to be in 2028, because it's not going to be Trump. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=550.0s)]
*  And let's see how long Trump is sort of an influential and sort of the number one figure within the Republican Party, even after they have a new nominee in 2028. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=555.0s)]
*  That's how you answer those questions. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=566.0s)]
*  But Musk could be an interesting figure if he decides to create a counterbalance to the Republican Party. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=568.0s)]
*  That's something to watch. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=574.0s)]
*  You know, I'd add here that I think it was just last week that Elon Musk said he was staying out of politics and he apparently had all the impulse control of my nine year old. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=577.0s)]
*  And this week he's back in politics. So who knows where he's going to be tomorrow? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=586.0s)]
*  Good point. David Drucker, Kelly O'Donnell and Jonathan Allen. Thank you all so much. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=590.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TpQBirK2Y&t=607.0s)]
