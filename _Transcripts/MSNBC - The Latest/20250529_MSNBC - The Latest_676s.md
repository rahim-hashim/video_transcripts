# 'Violation of due process': Lawyer of gay makeup artist deported speaks out
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo)
*  Welcome back this morning, a closer look at President Trump's immigration crackdown and the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=0.0s)]
*  lives upended by it. An NBC News exclusive report details the case of Andres Hernandez Romero, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=4.64s)]
*  a gay makeup artist who was among the group of Venezuelans deported from the U.S. to CICOT, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  that notorious Salvadoran prison that was back in March when President Trump invoked the Alien [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=16.4s)]
*  Enemies Act. After Romero's deportation, his lawyers fought to keep his asylum case open as a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=21.12s)]
*  way to keep him in the U.S. legal system, but on Wednesday a judge dismissed his case. I'm going [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=27.68s)]
*  to bring in NBC's David Noriega for more on his exclusive reporting. David, what else do people [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=33.68s)]
*  need to know about Andres' story, his case, and how it fits into the bigger picture? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=38.88s)]
*  Well, Ana, you know, Andres Hernandez is just one of the better known of these cases of Venezuelan [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=44.32s)]
*  men who were deported to the supermax prison in El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=49.04s)]
*  His story has resonated with a lot of people. He's a gay man, was a makeup artist for a state TV [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  station in Caracas. He came to the U.S. He told his lawyers here in the U.S. that he had fled [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=57.52s)]
*  Venezuela because he was suffering persecution for both his sexual orientation and his opposition to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=61.84s)]
*  the government of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. Now, those claims were the basis of his asylum [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=67.92s)]
*  case in the United States, which was in progress. And an immigration court in the detention center [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=74.48s)]
*  where he was being held in San Diego. When that process was abruptly terminated, when he was put [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=79.28s)]
*  on these planes on March 15th that were sent to El Salvador with no due process, no court hearings, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=85.2s)]
*  no communication with his lawyers, and up to this day, extremely little information, virtually no [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=89.84s)]
*  information about who these people were or the legal underpinnings for the decision to remove [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=94.72s)]
*  them to El Salvador. Now, the fact that the judge terminated his asylum case is important for a few [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=99.12s)]
*  reasons. When we talk about due process in these cases, what we are talking about often are these [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=105.04s)]
*  pending immigration cases in U.S. immigration courts, often asylum claims like the one that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  Hernandez Romero had. Those were the processes that were cut short by Trump invoking the Alien [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=114.88s)]
*  Enemies Act. So the lawyers, not just in this case, but in similar cases across the country, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=121.28s)]
*  were trying very hard to keep those cases open as a way of basically preserving the vestiges of this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  due process that was stopped in its tracks. Initially, the immigration judges were sort of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=130.96s)]
*  open to this. They were continuing the cases. They were keeping them open, even though the person in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=136.0s)]
*  question was absent and could not be contacted. But recently, in just the last couple of weeks, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=139.44s)]
*  judges have started agreeing with the government's motions to dismiss these cases. Now, the reason [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=144.48s)]
*  this is troubling to the families and the lawyers of these individuals is because it's essentially [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=149.04s)]
*  eliminating any trace, disappearing them from the American legal system. And this is, you know, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=154.0s)]
*  this, as it has always been, is a story about due process. It's important to remind people these [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=159.6s)]
*  people had pending immigration cases that were legally being assessed by a judge. That is the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=163.76s)]
*  process that was cut short when the Alien Enemies Act was invoked. I know you've been in contact [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=168.56s)]
*  with Andres' mom and best friend. What are you hearing from them? And have they had any contact [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=174.72s)]
*  with him? They have not had any contact with him. And every time I talk about these cases, I stress [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  that these men who were sent to this prison are in functionally a black hole. They are completely [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=186.48s)]
*  cut off from contact with the outside world, with counsel, with loved ones. The United States [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  government is not even acknowledging in court that they are there or identifying who they are. The [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  reason we know they're there is because we've seen pictures, some of the pictures that were [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=201.12s)]
*  released by the Salvadoran government or some other pictures taken by media in other cases. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=204.24s)]
*  The family of Andres Hernandez Romero is very distressed by the fact that his asylum case was [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=210.0s)]
*  closed. They saw keeping this asylum case open as, in their words, a beacon of hope that he might [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=215.12s)]
*  eventually be released and brought to the United States Senate. David Noriega, thank you so much [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=219.84s)]
*  for your reporting. And joining us now is Andres' lawyer, Lindsay Toslowski, executive director of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=224.0s)]
*  Immigrant Defenders Law Center. Lindsay, as David mentioned, the asylum case was dismissed for [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=229.28s)]
*  Andres. So what does that mean for him? Does the U.S. have any skin in the game at all to get him [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=235.28s)]
*  out of that prison in El Salvador? Absolutely. So we are continuing to fight, and we want to stress [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=240.48s)]
*  that his case being dismissed, his asylum case being dismissed, is not the end of Andres' story. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=248.08s)]
*  He is the lead plaintiff in JGG v. Trump, the ACLU lawsuit that is seeking the return of the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  men who are in secot, including Andres. We believe that they are in the constructive custody of the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  U.S. government still. There is an agreement between the U.S. government and El Salvador to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=267.84s)]
*  hold Andres and the others, today being day 75 that they are there in that supermax prison in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  El Salvador. So we will continue to fight in that court. We also intend to appeal this decision. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=279.92s)]
*  We think the judge was wrong here. Andres' case should be able to continue. He is only not in [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=288.0s)]
*  the court in San Diego because the U.S. government moved him to El Salvador. They rendered him to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=294.72s)]
*  El Salvador. He was seeking asylum. He was here. We were prepared to move forward, and we're still [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=301.92s)]
*  prepared to move forward. So we will not only fight within the asylum proceeding itself, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=307.84s)]
*  appeal this decision to a higher court, but we will continue to fight for his return in federal [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=313.28s)]
*  court. How frustrating is this for you as a lawyer, the system seemingly failing your client? You [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  can't even contact him, right? As I said, it's been 75 days. In my 15 years of practice, I have [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  never had a situation like this where our client effectively disappeared overnight. We have been [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=331.52s)]
*  given absolutely no information. Every single government official that we have spoken to asking [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=338.32s)]
*  to get proof of life for our client has told us that they will not facilitate communication. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=344.24s)]
*  In fact, the last proof of life we have are those horrific photos that were taken by a [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=351.2s)]
*  Time reporter of him being abused and slapped in the face as he arrived in El Salvador. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=355.92s)]
*  We have had Congressman Robert Garcia go down to El Salvador and ask through the U.S. Embassy and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=362.32s)]
*  two Salvadoran officials for proof of life for Andri, and we still have received nothing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=368.24s)]
*  It's an absolutely absurd situation. It's a violation of due process, and really, it should be [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=374.16s)]
*  a canary in the coal mine for everyone of what happens when the government ignores the rule of [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=380.16s)]
*  law. I know you are also involved in the case of Eric Eduardo Foneska Solorzano, a father from [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=384.96s)]
*  Honduras who was handcuffed and detained just moments after a judge issued a dismissal of his [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=391.2s)]
*  immigration case. The LA Times described how his wife trembled in panic. His son watched in wide [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=396.32s)]
*  eye disbelief as agents quickly shuffled him to a service elevator and he was gone. The boy was [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=403.12s)]
*  silent, sticking close by his mother, tears welling. How commonplace are situations like [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=408.72s)]
*  this now as the Trump administration tries to ramp up its immigration crackdown? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=415.04s)]
*  So beginning May 20th here in the Los Angeles area, and lawyers have reported across the country, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=420.40000000000003s)]
*  we began to see these courthouse arrests. I was in court when Mr. Solorzano was detained. I was in [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=425.68s)]
*  while the government moved to dismiss his case. He opposed on the record and told the judge that [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=434.56s)]
*  he wanted to remain in his asylum claim in proceedings with his wife and son who were also [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=441.44s)]
*  there in the courtroom. And over his objections, the judge moved forward and dismissed his case. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=447.04s)]
*  He was unrepresented at the time. As we exited the courtroom, I followed the family out and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=452.72s)]
*  actually witnessed the ICE officers, six of them in plain clothes, not wearing uniforms, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=459.2s)]
*  come up to the father, detain him, handcuff him in front of his son as tears brimmed in his eyes. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=467.92s)]
*  I then went downstairs with the family. And I can tell you that to see that little boy, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=475.36s)]
*  he was only eight years old in his school uniform, who came to court. It was their very first court [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=481.52s)]
*  date after entering the United States with an appointment, doing everything the government has [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=487.76s)]
*  asked them to do to seek asylum in the United States. To see his face, it was almost as if he [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  had aged two years from the time we left the eighth floor and got to the bottom floor. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=498.48s)]
*  He was completely traumatized. And all of this so that the government can separate his father's case, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=504.24s)]
*  put him in expedited removal, because we continue to see the Trump administration [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=511.12s)]
*  finding fundamental fairness in due process in our immigration courts, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=515.92s)]
*  inconvenient to their plans for mass deportation. They believe that it doesn't move things fast [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=520.4799999999999s)]
*  enough. But due process is a bedrock of our justice system. And so we took that case. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=525.68s)]
*  We will continue to represent that family, continue to fight for them. But he was moved [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=532.4799999999999s)]
*  this weekend 1,100 miles away to Washington state. And so we are continuing to represent him. But [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=539.04s)]
*  it is incredibly challenging what's happening in our immigration courts. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=545.6s)]
*  Lindsay, something you said really caught my ear. And that is, this is an example of a case where [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=548.88s)]
*  migrants attempted to follow the so-called right way to work within the system, did everything [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=554.72s)]
*  that they were essentially told to do, whether it's applying through that CDP, one app previously [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=561.28s)]
*  to have their asylum case now into the system. I mean, are they suddenly now easier targets [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=567.52s)]
*  because they did it the right way? That's exactly right. And that's why this is incredibly bad [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=575.6s)]
*  policy. It comes down to that fundamentally, because when you target people in immigration [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=582.24s)]
*  court, when you target the people who show up, the people who came in, were paroled into the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=588.4000000000001s)]
*  United States, go to their hearings, listen to the notices that they have, come in to avail [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=595.12s)]
*  themselves of the system, to seek asylum through that process. When you target them, what does [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=601.84s)]
*  that say to other people? It tells people that they should be afraid to come to court, that they [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=607.6s)]
*  need to go into the shadows. This is bad policy. It makes us less safe as communities if we are [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=612.96s)]
*  punishing the very people who follow the rules. And I sat in a courtroom yesterday and watched [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=618.96s)]
*  this happen to person after person who were surprised after they walked out of the courtroom [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=624.8s)]
*  to be accosted, sometimes by masked agents in the hallways and taken into custody. These were people [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2A4pI9f0fo&t=630.9599999999999s)]
