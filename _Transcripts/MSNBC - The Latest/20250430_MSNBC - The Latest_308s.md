# The trade war that stole Christmas? Trump downplays tariff turmoil as retailers fear toy shortage
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg)
*  And if you need more proof of the negative impact of tariffs, the New York Times is reporting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=0.0s)]
*  that major American manufacturers and retailers are pausing orders for the winter holidays [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=5.36s)]
*  in the face of skyrocketing costs. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=10.28s)]
*  Factories in China produce 90% of Christmas goods sold in the U.S. and nearly 80% of all [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=13.16s)]
*  toys. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=18.84s)]
*  As one op-ed put it, with no transition time, Trump's tariffs have the potential of obliterating [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=20.16s)]
*  the toy business. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=25.88s)]
*  Joining me now, Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a company that sells learning-based [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=27.84s)]
*  toys. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=32.8s)]
*  He is currently suing President Trump over the new tariffs. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=33.8s)]
*  Thanks so much for being on the show. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=37.92s)]
*  And give us a sense, what have tariffs done to your business? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=39.56s)]
*  Well, it sort of stopped us in our tracks. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=43.28s)]
*  You know, economics is a behavioral science, and so when they change the rules, our decisions [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  change. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=53.24s)]
*  Between April 2nd and April 9th, we basically stopped all production in China, and we stopped [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=54.24s)]
*  as much shipping as we could. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  19 shipments, unfortunately, got out, raising the cost for those shipments from about $15,000 [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  in duties last year to about a million this year, for missing it by one day. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=67.6s)]
*  Say that again. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=72.64s)]
*  Say that again. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=73.64s)]
*  That change? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=74.64s)]
*  Those 19 shipments would have produced a bill of about $15,000 last year to import, and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=76.8s)]
*  this year it would be more than a million dollars. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=81.52s)]
*  And we got 36 hours notice, and it wasn't enough time to stop the shipments. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=84.36s)]
*  So if we choose to import them, the bill would be a million dollars. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=88.28s)]
*  So we're hearing a lot about retailers pausing orders for Christmas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=92.6s)]
*  How important is the holiday season to your revenue stream? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's, you know, it's probably 30 to 40 percent of our annual revenue. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=100.92s)]
*  For the whole industry, it's a massive source of when we make our profits. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=106.42s)]
*  And that goes further. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=111.88s)]
*  It also is a massive source of the necessary revenue and profits for your neighborhood [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=113.2s)]
*  stores, national retail chains, and so on. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=118.58s)]
*  The whole economy revolves around the torrent of buying that goes to Christmas. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=121.18s)]
*  That's how people get their jobs. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=125.38s)]
*  So no products. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=127.98s)]
*  The revenue is going to fall, and there's going to be a price to be paid soon. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=128.98s)]
*  The president, I'm sure you were listening to him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=134.62s)]
*  He suggested that the things that are wrong with the economy, generally the stock market [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  specifically, are because of Joe Biden and his policies. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=140.58s)]
*  Things that headlines just in the last few minutes in both the Wall Street Journal and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=144.02s)]
*  CNBC say is absolutely not true, that they're related to tariffs. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=148.06s)]
*  But I particularly, because you make essentially educational toys, I want to read for you what [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=152.36s)]
*  Donald Trump said about how these concerns that Christmas is going to be impacted, and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=160.5s)]
*  the toy business in particular, by tariffs. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=167.94s)]
*  Quote Donald Trump, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=171.14s)]
*  the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  But we're not talking something where we have to go out of our way. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  They have ships that are loaded up with stuff, quote unquote. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=185.52s)]
*  As someone in the business, what's your reaction to that? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=190.66s)]
*  Complete outrage that the president of the United States is denigrating our industry [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  and taking away the validity of what we do. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  We're not rounding error. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=204.28s)]
*  We're an important part of the community that we live in. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=205.28s)]
*  Our company makes educational products we sell into schools, and we sell into homes, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  and there's a lot of people who depend on what we do. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=213.0s)]
*  So obviously frustrating that he basically says what happens to us and the 500 people [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=215.76s)]
*  that work in our company is no concern of his. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=220.32s)]
*  I can tell you that the stock market is going down in my opinion because only one thing [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=222.76s)]
*  has changed, and that's these tariffs. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=226.56s)]
*  The economy was booming when he came in, and he hit us with tariffs. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=229.58s)]
*  We are responding to the incentives that he's given us. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=234.86s)]
*  10% was a big problem for us, and we immediately began canceling events and cutting our spending. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=238.94s)]
*  It's now gone up into the stratosphere. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=245.68s)]
*  It's two and a half times what he said on the Campento would be the highest tariff he [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=247.88s)]
*  would put out. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=252.28s)]
*  There's no way to survive this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=253.48s)]
*  We're in the most competitive market in the world. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=254.88s)]
*  And I'd like to say one other thing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=258.4s)]
*  He said, you know, we have to take our medicine. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=260.72s)]
*  We're not taking medicine here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=263.72s)]
*  We're taking poison. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=265.26s)]
*  This is going to kill these businesses. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=267.34s)]
*  I'm one of 300,000 businesses in many industries that are similarly situated and similarly [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=269.53999999999996s)]
*  affected. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=275.85999999999996s)]
*  We're not a rounding error. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=276.85999999999996s)]
*  You can talk to any of our employees and ask them. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=278.38s)]
*  Rick Woldenburg, thank you. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=282.65999999999997s)]
*  I hope you'll come back and we'll talk moving forward. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzosxm5LJg&t=285.41999999999996s)]
