# 'Clear Putin thinks he has the upper hand': Trump pushes for ceasefire in call with Russian leader
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU)
*  I want to bring in NBC's Yamiche Alcindor, who's covering the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=0.0s)]
*  Peter Baker is the New York Times chief White House correspondent and an MSNBC political [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=3.6s)]
*  analyst. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Michael Crowley is also with the Times and covers the State Department and U.S. foreign [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  policy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=12.88s)]
*  So, Yamiche, what do we know about this call and what the president is wanting here? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=13.88s)]
*  Well, the big question is, how long is this call going to go? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=18.48s)]
*  From our understanding, the call is under way. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=22.64s)]
*  We haven't gotten any information from the White House that the call has ended. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=24.72s)]
*  So this could be a very long call between these two leaders. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=28.64s)]
*  Now, President Trump has really raised the stakes here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=31.48s)]
*  He said that nothing could happen when it came to these peace talks to try to end this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=34.36s)]
*  war between Russia and Ukraine unless he and Vladimir Putin spoke directly. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=38.52s)]
*  So that is now happening. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=43.44s)]
*  We also have heard from White House officials and top Trump aides that the two at some point [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=44.92s)]
*  might be getting together in person. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=48.88s)]
*  We know, of course, that the president is also planning to meet, speak separately with [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=51.32s)]
*  the president of Ukraine as well as NATO leaders later on today. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  So also watching to see what happens there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=58.68s)]
*  Our understanding is that European leaders are pushing for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  We're not sure if President Putin is going to agree to that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=66.92s)]
*  President Trump is saying that he wants a complete end to what he's calling a blood [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=70.0s)]
*  bath. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=73.16s)]
*  The other thing that's interesting here is that even after we saw that disastrous Oval [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=74.16s)]
*  Office spray between President Trump and the president of Ukraine where he, where President [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=77.24s)]
*  Trump said that he was disrespectful and said that he didn't want to end the war, we've [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=82.2s)]
*  now seen President Trump sort of take a sharper tone actually against Russia, something that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=85.76s)]
*  he hasn't done in the past, saying that he might have sanctions against them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  So it's going to be very interesting to see what the president says after this call ends [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=94.36000000000001s)]
*  and sort of what is the next step here, because there's a lot riding on this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=98.48s)]
*  I should also note that the vice president is out just today in the last few hours in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  Italy saying that if the U.S. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  doesn't see enough progress, that they could walk away altogether. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  That, of course, would be really, really hard for Ukraine. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=110.72s)]
*  So a lot to a lot riding on this call and definitely something that we're continuing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=113.08s)]
*  to report on. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=117.16s)]
*  Chris. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=118.16s)]
*  So, Michael, the president has been pushing for an end to this war for months. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=119.16s)]
*  It hasn't happened, obviously. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=122.16s)]
*  So why should we think that it will be different this time? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=123.96s)]
*  What are the, I guess, circumstances surrounding it that might make it possible to happen? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=127.08s)]
*  Oh, I don't think we should think that it will be different this time fundamentally, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=134.84s)]
*  substantively. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, something I will be looking for is whether Vladimir Putin plays this in a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  clever way, which is to give Trump something in this call where Trump can walk away and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=146.72s)]
*  say that he's gotten a concession and that they're making progress, but something that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=153.96s)]
*  doesn't actually box Putin in. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=158.2s)]
*  I mean, it's clear at this point that Putin thinks he has an upper hand and wants to continue [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  the war and does not want to do the kind of comprehensive deal that Trump is looking for. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=164.76s)]
*  But at the same time, despite these increasing threats from the White House, just given everything [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=171.28s)]
*  we know about Trump going back for a decade now, it's very difficult to imagine Trump [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=176.32s)]
*  confronting Putin or escalating pressure against him. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  You really get a sense that Trump wants to be in Putin's good graces. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  So I think Trump, based on what we know, will be very eager to take anything from Putin, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=188.16s)]
*  maybe some kind of a partial brief ceasefire like we saw the Russians agree to weeks ago, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=192.88s)]
*  something very limited and partial, and say that he's making progress and essentially [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=198.28s)]
*  kick the can down the road. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=202.32s)]
*  That would be one very likely scenario to me. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=204.28s)]
*  The one last thing I would say here is I think the biggest question is that if Putin proves [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=206.72s)]
*  more intransigent than that and he doesn't give anything, you hear administration officials [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=211.44s)]
*  talk about walking away from this process. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=216.56s)]
*  And the question is, does walking away mean just no longer trying to mediate a peace agreement [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  or does it mean walking away from everything, including support for Ukraine, which would [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=223.8s)]
*  be a de facto huge victory for Russia if America is not going to resume support for Ukraine? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  So that's the giant question looming in the background here. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=232.96s)]
*  Peter, I want to play part of what the Vice President, JD Vance, had to say about all [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=236.16s)]
*  of this just this morning. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=240.24s)]
*  Look, I think one open question is, is Vladimir Putin serious about negotiating peace, right? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=241.76s)]
*  He has made some concessions. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=249.44s)]
*  He has taken some serious steps in these conversations. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  But we feel like we're at a point where we're hitting an impasse, and that's why the president [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  is talking to him on the phone. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=258.88s)]
*  I think honestly that President Putin, he doesn't quite know how to get out of the war. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=260.44s)]
*  So he doesn't know how to get out of the war, Peter, and also suggests he doesn't have a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=266.08s)]
*  Do you think Putin is under any pressure? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=271.64s)]
*  What is the pressure the White House thinks it has to bring to bear? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=274.76s)]
*  Well, I think actually very few people think that Putin is serious about ending the war [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  at this point. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=283.64s)]
*  There isn't going to be any evidence of that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=284.64s)]
*  He seemed to think he has the upper hand. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=286.96s)]
*  He has bragged that he is making progress on the battlefield, exaggerating what's actually [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=289.0s)]
*  happening there, of course. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  And as Michael just rightly pointed out, if the alternative to a peace deal that he doesn't [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  want is the United States walks away from Ukraine, that is, as Michael said, a victory [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  because it means that they no longer have to worry about United States arms. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=305.2s)]
*  And most importantly, they don't have to worry about United States intelligence, which has [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=309.12s)]
*  been crucial to helping the Ukrainians target and fend off Russian forces. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=311.92s)]
*  So Putin looks at this as a win-win, I think, at this point. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  Now, it's interesting to hear Trump and his people express frustration with Putin. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=321.24s)]
*  That hasn't been something that he's done a lot over the last 10 years. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=327.0s)]
*  Trump is such an admirer of Putin over the years, called him a genius, called him very [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=329.84s)]
*  savvy, expressed so much admiration of him. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=333.96s)]
*  Today, Caroline Levitt, the White House press secretary, said that the president is frustrated [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=337.44s)]
*  with both sides, me and the Russians and the Ukrainians. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=340.64s)]
*  From the Ukrainian point of view, if these talks are going to collapse, the important [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=343.52s)]
*  thing for them is to make sure that Putin gets the blame, or at least as much of the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=348.12s)]
*  blame as they can muster, because they don't want Trump to back away and they don't want [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=351.32s)]
*  Trump to say, you know, to wipe his hands and say pox on both their houses. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=355.92s)]
*  You mentioned what Caroline Levitt had to say, that he's frustrated, and I think she [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  also said he is weary. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=365.24s)]
*  What does history tell us about Donald Trump's stick-to-itiveness over the course of a long [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=369.20000000000005s)]
*  period of time with a difficult, sophisticated problem? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=374.44s)]
*  If weariness is setting in, what does that mean for the long term, especially if you're [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=380.24s)]
*  President Zelensky? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=385.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, you know, I think you mentioned this, President Trump overestimated [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=386.8s)]
*  his ability to solve this war. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=392.36s)]
*  He told people time and time again last year on the campaign trail that he would end the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=394.12s)]
*  war within 24 hours, he said. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  In fact, it would be so easy, he would do it even before he was sworn in as president. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=400.24s)]
*  Of course, that didn't happen. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=404.64s)]
*  And his tolerance for long, drawn-out negotiations, which unfortunately are, in fact, you know, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=406.36s)]
*  common in international relations, is pretty thin. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=413.56s)]
*  And if he decides, ah, this isn't working, I'm going to move on to something else, he [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=416.64s)]
*  tends to sort of shift his attention to whatever the next shiny bauble might be. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=419.76s)]
*  He's feeling more confident right now about his negotiations with Iran to make a nuclear [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=424.12s)]
*  deal. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=428.64s)]
*  And he might just, in fact, put his energies there and say, that's my big diplomatic victory [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=429.64s)]
*  of the year. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=433.0s)]
*  And he's going to give me a nuclear peace prize and forget Ukraine. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=434.0s)]
*  So it wouldn't surprise me if he does lose interest. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=437.64s)]
*  That happens a lot with him. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=440.44s)]
*  Yeah, the Nobel is something we know that he would love to have. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=441.68s)]
*  Michael, I want to play part of what Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said yesterday [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=444.96s)]
*  about today's call. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=449.72s)]
*  President has a force of personality that is unmatched. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=453.12s)]
*  I think it's important. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=457.72s)]
*  His sensibilities are that he's got to get on the phone with President Putin. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=459.36s)]
*  And that is going to clear up some of the logjam and get us to the place that we need [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=463.68s)]
*  to get to. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=469.04s)]
*  So, Michael, roll call did account. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=470.04s)]
*  They say Trump claimed 53 different times on the campaign trail. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=472.2s)]
*  He could end the war in Ukraine in less than 24 hours. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=477.0s)]
*  And a lot of it does seem to be based on that confidence. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=480.12s)]
*  We just heard from Witkoff that the president has an unmatched force of personality. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=482.36s)]
*  We know personal relationships do play an important role in diplomacy. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=488.86s)]
*  But have they put too many eggs in that basket? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=492.94s)]
*  What do we know really about the relationship between those two leaders? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=495.34s)]
*  Well, you know, we know that publicly it's a relationship where Trump seems to be the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=501.3s)]
*  suitor who flatters Vladimir Putin, who courts him and craves his respect. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=510.9s)]
*  I mean, this goes all the way back to I was revisiting recently when Trump owned the Miss [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=516.78s)]
*  Universe beauty pageant and brought it to Moscow in 2015, I believe, maybe a year or [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=521.76s)]
*  two earlier than that. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=526.24s)]
*  And he was tweeting at the time, I'm going to be going to Moscow with my beauty pageant. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=527.54s)]
*  Do you think Vladimir Putin will meet with me? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=531.48s)]
*  Do you think he will be my best friend? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=533.52s)]
*  I mean, literally, he said, do you think he will be my best friend? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=535.48s)]
*  That kind of set the tone for this relationship where Trump is the supplicant. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=538.54s)]
*  Now, at the same time, it's shrouded in a certain amount of mystery. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=542.0s)]
*  You know, they have phone calls. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=545.0s)]
*  We don't know all the details. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=547.7s)]
*  There are times when the White House won't confirm or deny that there were conversations [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=549.6s)]
*  or the Trump transition after the election. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=553.32s)]
*  You know, they weren't very clear about whether they were talking or not. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=555.72s)]
*  So there's a level of mystery here. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  But ultimately, I would say two things. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=560.6800000000001s)]
*  One, Trump's force of personality has failed before. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=563.16s)]
*  Remember when he tried to get a nuclear deal with Kim Jong-un. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=567.32s)]
*  His force of personality got Kim out to do some spectacular photo ops with the president [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=569.8000000000001s)]
*  and sort of normalize and legitimize his image. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=574.6s)]
*  But they totally failed to make any progress on a real deal. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=577.44s)]
*  And number two, Vladimir Putin has been president of Russia now for something like 25 years. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=581.12s)]
*  He was a former KGB intelligence operative. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=586.24s)]
*  You know, this is not a guy who you're just going to kind of fast talk into something. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=591.6400000000001s)]
*  So I'm just very skeptical of those claims. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=596.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, I had completely forgotten about the Miss Universe comments. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=599.0s)]
*  And I think it's very telling and a reminder to all of us how consistent Donald Trump has [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=603.84s)]
*  been across many, many decades. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=608.3000000000001s)]
*  Yamiche Alcindor, thank you. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=611.2s)]
*  Peter Baker and Michael Crowley, you're staying with me. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsANlPz7LU&t=612.48s)]
