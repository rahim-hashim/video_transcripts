# Texas 'deserves transparency!' Noem, Trump facing backlash over FEMA response
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8)
*  Today, multiple Democratic lawmakers, including some from Texas, are formally demanding answers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=0.0s)]
*  from the administration about the impact of budget cuts and DHS policies on the government's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=6.44s)]
*  ability to respond to the devastating floods. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=11.4s)]
*  Texas Democratic Congressman Greg Kessler is one of them, chair of the Congressional Progressive [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=14.74s)]
*  Caucus, and he joins me now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=19.62s)]
*  Congressman, it's good to have you on the program. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=21.32s)]
*  Again, what are the specific concerns, both that you've heard raised, but also the questions [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=23.44s)]
*  you want answered? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=29.22s)]
*  Pexons deserve answers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=33.38s)]
*  If we want to both respect the dead, have government accountability, and keep people [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=35.42s)]
*  safe moving forward, we can't let any mistakes be swept under the rug. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=40.74s)]
*  And so I, as a member of the Oversight Committee, am working alongside our ranking member, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  the top Democrat, Robert Garcia, to demand an independent investigation into what went [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=52.78s)]
*  right. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=59.300000000000004s)]
*  We should be thankful to the first responders that saved lives, but also what went wrong. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=60.300000000000004s)]
*  I'm especially concerned with the reports coming out from whistleblowers at FEMA that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=65.58s)]
*  DHS Secretary Noem waited 72 hours to approve search and rescue from FEMA. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  A request like that, you shouldn't have to think about it for even 72 seconds, much less [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=77.9s)]
*  72 hours. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=82.38s)]
*  We have also not seen any public appearance or press conference from the director of FEMA, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=84.3s)]
*  David Richardson. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=89.58s)]
*  He's kind of the interim here since the flooding happened. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=90.46s)]
*  Do you know why that is? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  And is it a problem? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=96.02s)]
*  We deserve transparency at every level of government, local, state and federal. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=99.97999999999999s)]
*  And I'm very concerned that the Trump administration has clearly said that they want to get rid [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=106.5s)]
*  of FEMA as we know it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=112.14s)]
*  And the American people and people in Texas especially deserve to know if the cuts at [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=114.66s)]
*  FEMA are impacting our preparedness for the next flood or the next fire and what impact [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=120.7s)]
*  they had here in central Texas. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=127.14s)]
*  Right now where I'm sitting in Travis County, we had far too many people die. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=129.74s)]
*  And then just, of course, up the road, which you just saw in Kerrville, is devastating. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=132.94s)]
*  This is not about politics. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=137.14s)]
*  This is about accountability for what just happened and making sure we keep people safe [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=139.46s)]
*  because Texans and Americans are facing deadlier fires, deadlier freezes and deadlier floods [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  year after year after year. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=151.22s)]
*  And Americans deserve to know whether these massive cuts at the National Weather Service [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=153.82s)]
*  and these failures at FEMA are making things worse. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=158.38s)]
*  There's also a key question, which is whatever money there is, who should be spending it, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=162.3s)]
*  right? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=166.54000000000002s)]
*  Back in May, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, said FEMA is, and I'm quoting him here, slow [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=167.62s)]
*  and clunky. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=172.62s)]
*  He said states have proven that we can move more nimbly, more swiftly, more effectively. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=173.9s)]
*  What do you think is that balance? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=180.18s)]
*  I mean, is it less FEMA, more state? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=181.89999999999998s)]
*  How do you see it as someone who lives in a state that has seen more than its share of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  natural disasters? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=190.28s)]
*  Well, I've seen far too many failures from Governor Abbott during natural disasters just [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=192.9s)]
*  a few years ago. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=199.14000000000001s)]
*  Here we had winter storm Uri where people were dying in a freeze while some of Governor [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=200.66s)]
*  Abbott's own donors were making millions and millions of dollars jacking up electricity [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  prices. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=212.70000000000002s)]
*  We need to ask real questions about why the state of Texas rejected grants to our communities [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  for flood warning systems. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=219.29999999999998s)]
*  And right now, the special session that the governor has called, I wish it was really [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=221.98s)]
*  about flooding, but what he has made his real priority in there is out of cycle redistricting, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=226.14s)]
*  essentially doing Trump's bidding and trying to get even more gerrymandering in Texas to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=233.54s)]
*  stop there being accountability for the Trump administration. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=239.14s)]
*  I think we should be putting more money towards flooding, but we now have a governor that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=242.54s)]
*  instead of having a special session really about these floods, he's making it about [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=246.86s)]
*  politics. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=251.06s)]
*  This shouldn't be about politics. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=252.06s)]
*  It should be about getting answers. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=253.06s)]
*  And whether it is a Democratic or Republican administration, we should be getting answers [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=255.3s)]
*  about what went wrong at the state, local and federal levels. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=259.3s)]
*  Let me ask you a big picture because you touched on this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=264.54s)]
*  The number and severity of natural disasters continues to increase all across the country. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=267.38s)]
*  In fact, Texas got hit so far this year more than any other state. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=272.46s)]
*  You see those numbers, California, Oklahoma and Washington, two, three and four there. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=277.09999999999997s)]
*  Only a handful of states are immune so far this year. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=283.06s)]
*  Is there any sense of urgency that you detect on Capitol Hill to deal with that? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=287.29999999999995s)]
*  We know that with this administration and this majority, climate change and some of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  the programs that were put into effect by the Biden administration may be off the table. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=299.38s)]
*  But do you think things like this in a red state could change the equation at all? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=304.85999999999996s)]
*  It better because, look, I think it is extremely dangerous and disheartening that funds have [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=312.97999999999996s)]
*  been completely slashed to help prevent climate change and even worse disasters. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=320.17999999999995s)]
*  But what I just am trying and struggling to understand here is why the Trump administration [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=326.94s)]
*  has cut funding for projects to protect us from disasters happening right now. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=332.62s)]
*  Just up the street from where I'm sitting right now here in southeast Travis County, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=338.9s)]
*  the Trump administration cut a grant that the Biden administration had already given [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=343.74s)]
*  to prevent flooding in the most flood ravaged part of the Austin area, just really close [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=348.7s)]
*  here to where the floods happened in Kerrville. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=355.65999999999997s)]
*  And so what we're experiencing, seeing from the Trump administration is not just climate [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  change denialism, but straight up natural disaster denialism. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=362.21999999999997s)]
*  So that's why we're asking for this kind of accountability and transparency in these floods. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=367.41999999999996s)]
*  Because when you have severe staffing shortages at the National Weather Service, when you [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=373.2s)]
*  have somebody in charge of FEMA who says she wants to get rid of FEMA as we know it, and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=378.14s)]
*  then you have a devastating flood like this one, I think it's a disservice to the victims [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=384.78s)]
*  for us to not ask the hard questions. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=389.82s)]
*  If we wait a few more weeks, we know sometimes the news cycle could just move on and we cannot [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  forget these children and these seniors and these everyday neighbors that survived this [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=397.0s)]
*  traumatizing incident. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=402.02s)]
*  And we especially can't forget those that did not survive. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=403.5s)]
*  Congressman, we appreciate your time. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=406.29999999999995s)]
*  I know it's very busy. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=408.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsab-iOZe8&t=409.41999999999996s)]
