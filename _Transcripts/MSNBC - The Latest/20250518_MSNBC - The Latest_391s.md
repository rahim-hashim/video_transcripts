# Crypto assets ‘are the perfect vehicle for corruption’: Ethics expert on Trump meme coin
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY)
*  They're giving it to the United States Air Force slash Defense Department of the United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=0.0s)]
*  States. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=6.34s)]
*  They're not giving it to me. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=7.34s)]
*  I made a good deal. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=8.34s)]
*  The transaction strikes me as being rife with political espionage, ethical and constitutional [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=9.98s)]
*  problems. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=22.06s)]
*  There are those that say, we shouldn't be accepting gifts to the Defense Department. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=23.06s)]
*  And I would say only a stupid person would say that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=27.22s)]
*  Why wouldn't we do that? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=29.44s)]
*  You're saying President Trump should turn down this plane? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=30.44s)]
*  I think he should. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=33.52s)]
*  I think, look, others have observed there are profound issues, the potential for intelligence [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=34.64s)]
*  gathering. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=43.06s)]
*  Lingering questions as President Trump forges ahead with a plan to accept a $400 million [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=45.06s)]
*  jet from the government of Qatar solely for his use as an interim upgrade to Air Force [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=49.88s)]
*  One. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=55.44s)]
*  We now have Virginia Cantor, chief counsel for ethics and anti-corruption with State [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=56.46s)]
*  Democracy Defenders Action. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=60.62s)]
*  She is one of three co-authors of a New York Times op-ed headline, A Plane from Qatar? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=62.58s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=67.74s)]
*  Virginia, thank you for being with us. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=68.74s)]
*  You've interpreted rules related to gifts from the presidents from foreign governments [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=71.62s)]
*  when President Clinton was in office. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=75.94s)]
*  Trump says this plane is not a personal gift to him. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=78.3s)]
*  He often points to the plane at the Reagan Library as an example, an equivalent one. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=81.42s)]
*  How do you see it? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=86.34s)]
*  Oh, there's no question that this is a personal gift to him and that he intends to use it [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=87.34s)]
*  for his personal use after the presidency. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=95.12s)]
*  If it were a gift to the United States government, it would have to be accepted on behalf of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  the U.S. government, and no government official would want the responsibility of tearing apart [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  and rebuilding a $400 million plane from Qatar. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=108.44s)]
*  You'd have to make sure that, you know, it's completely secure. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=112.12s)]
*  You'd have to take apart every single, you know, nut and bolt, and you'd have to, you [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=116.08s)]
*  know, tear apart all of the cushions to make sure there was no listening devices. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=124.14s)]
*  And you know, there's no, you know, having been involved in deliberations on whether [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=129.02s)]
*  or not a president can accept a gift, you would only use that authority if it were somehow [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=133.86s)]
*  to be embarrassing to decline. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=139.68s)]
*  There's no way that anybody would ever expect the president of the United States, which [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=141.4s)]
*  has, you know, one of the most powerful and important images of Air Force One, would ever, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=146.28s)]
*  ever want to accept a plane from a foreign government. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=153.84s)]
*  Trump's crypto activities, another area of concern in your wonderfully titled op-ed. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=158.88s)]
*  And Thursday, Trump is hosting a dinner at his Virginia Golf Club for the top 220 holders [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=164.08s)]
*  of his mean coin. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=168.6s)]
*  Two analysis by CNBC and Bloomberg found that at least 19 of the top 25 holders are likely [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=170.6s)]
*  non-Americans. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  A White House spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal, quote, President Trump only acts [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  in the best interests of the American public. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=181.4s)]
*  Administration officials previously denied any conflict of interest, saying the meme [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=184.72s)]
*  coin dinner is an outside business engagement. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=188.22s)]
*  It is not an official White House event. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=190.28s)]
*  So Virginia, what concerns you most about who has bought a seat at the table with Trump? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=192.44s)]
*  Well, it's a it's a perfect crypto assets because they lack transparency. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=198.84s)]
*  It's anonymous financing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=203.8s)]
*  They're the perfect vehicle for corruption. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  And in this case, what's interesting about the meme coin is by itself, it has absolutely [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=208.28s)]
*  no value. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  It's a digital image. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=214.26000000000002s)]
*  And you know, it's it's sold, I think, at the outset for seven dollars and then it went [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=217.28s)]
*  up to seventy nine and then it crashed. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=222.22s)]
*  I mean, I think some people estimate the losses of individuals at two billion dollars, but [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=224.68s)]
*  it's a perfect way to monetize the presidency. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=230.8s)]
*  And that seems to be what President Trump has done here. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=233.84s)]
*  He's providing the top two hundred and twenty investors personal access to him through a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=237.36s)]
*  private dinner at one of his local golf clubs. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=243.72s)]
*  I think he also had offered a VIP reception and White House tour to the top 20 donors. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=246.88s)]
*  I'm not sure what the status of that is, but it's, you know, the perfect vehicle for obtaining [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=253.16s)]
*  access to the president. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=259.44s)]
*  I will say I believe that White House that White House tour, I believe, was withdrawn [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=260.84s)]
*  from the whole package deal. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=265.48s)]
*  Let me get to, though, another New York Times op-ed in which a public policy professor wrote [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  for Trump, quote, Shamelessness is a superpower. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=271.64s)]
*  His scandals are out in the open and he insists they are not scandals at all. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=275.52s)]
*  Trump's current administration is explicitly personalist. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=279.6s)]
*  It has built around loyalty to him, even as he blurs his personal interests and public [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=282.76s)]
*  offices. Virginia, do you agree with that opinion? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=287.88s)]
*  And if so, what is the impact of this sort of transparency? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=291.76s)]
*  So I think, you know, I think the op-ed made a very valid point. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=297.32s)]
*  But and I think the purpose of transparency and is to normalize it, in other words, to make it [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=303.2s)]
*  seem like something everybody does. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=310.76s)]
*  And we should just accept it as part of our, you know, public life. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=313.32s)]
*  And it's a very, very dangerous as a result. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=320.4s)]
*  That's why we have to call it out. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=322.92s)]
*  When we see it, we either have to fight corruption or a see to it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=324.68s)]
*  We have to either fight for what we believe in as part of the values of the United States of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=328.56s)]
*  America, or we're going to see to a corrupt state of America. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=333.2s)]
*  We have legislation now pending. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=337.12s)]
*  You mentioned the crypto assets. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=339.08s)]
*  We have legislation pending before Congress now that would establish regulatory frameworks [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=341.44s)]
*  under the Genius Act and Market Structuring Act that do fail to address conflicts of interest. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=347.84s)]
*  And we have to take this on if if if we're or we will just see to a corrupt state. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  Virginia Cantor, again, author one more time of the New York Times op-ed headline, A Plane [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=360.92s)]
*  from Qatar. Come on, man. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=366.32s)]
*  I just had to say it again. It's great. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=368.64s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXivF1h3eY&t=370.12s)]
