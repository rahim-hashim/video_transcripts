# 'Not a good look': Republicans 'panicking quietly' over Trump tariff uncertainty
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4)
*  China probably will eat those tariffs but at 145 they basically can't do much [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=0.0s)]
*  business with the United States and they were making from us a trillion dollars [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=5.28s)]
*  a year they were ripping us off like nobody's ever ripped us off. That was [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=10.14s)]
*  President Trump last night defending his massive tariffs on China and while the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=14.96s)]
*  president says China will eat those tariffs there are new warnings about how [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=19.52s)]
*  those tariffs are already eating into the US economy. As we've covered new [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  numbers this morning show the US economy shrunk in the first quarter of the year [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=28.98s)]
*  with GDP down 0.3%. Meantime at America's ports we're hearing big changes [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  are coming. The port of Los Angeles expects shipping volume to drop by 35% [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=39.86s)]
*  next week as companies begin to cut their import orders and specialty [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=44.38s)]
*  retailers, toy makers, they're already pausing, Christmas orders that could have [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=50.38s)]
*  significant impact. More than 80% of toys are made in Chinese factories. For [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=55.26s)]
*  more on this Amy Parnes, the Hill Senior Political Correspondent is standing by [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=61.099999999999994s)]
*  but first let's go to NBC Steve Patterson joining us live by the port of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=64.86s)]
*  Los Angeles. Steve what more are you hearing from officials there about the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=68.94s)]
*  impact of these tariffs? Yeah and I've been in touch with port officials with [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=72.66s)]
*  union leadership with the larger small business community in this area for the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=77.9s)]
*  better part of a month. Everybody knew that this reduction in cargo was coming [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=81.86s)]
*  but 35% was on the higher end of projections and now we're hearing about [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=86.22s)]
*  a 25% reduction in the amount of ships that will be coming for the month of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=91.3s)]
*  May. These numbers are significant and it will bleed all the way down the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=95.1s)]
*  supply chain until it hits consumers starting of course with the longshoremen [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=100.38s)]
*  who work the port. There's about 15,000 of them in this area 54% live in or [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=104.42s)]
*  around this direct area. They of course are worried about a reduction of hours. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=110.02000000000001s)]
*  They're worried about what that means for layoffs and their livelihoods of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=114.34s)]
*  course tied to this not to mention of course the coffee shops and the pizza [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=118.42s)]
*  shops and the barber shops in this area but also the wholesalers and the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=121.38000000000001s)]
*  truckers who depend on this amount of cargo for what they do. We spoke to the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=125.82000000000001s)]
*  port CEO about what's gonna happen next. Here's what he says they are worried [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=131.02s)]
*  about right now. Listen to this. I will say this is unique in all my years in [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=134.78s)]
*  this industry. We're not hitting the panic button yet but again I'm focused [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=140.34s)]
*  on some of the smaller businesses. A trucker who's hauling four or five [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=144.02s)]
*  containers today may only be hauling two or three next week or two. Same thing [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=147.86s)]
*  with the warehouse workers and our dock workers who have been getting overtime [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=153.54s)]
*  and full work weeks may have to scale that back as well. And we mentioned [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=156.82s)]
*  folks here knew this was coming also that includes the big retailers who knew [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=161.7s)]
*  this was coming and so they up fronted a lot of their goods. It resulted at the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=166.06s)]
*  port of Long Beach and one of the record first quarters that they've had in a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=169.94s)]
*  long time. The first three months of the year 25% up from 2024 2.5 million of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=173.82s)]
*  those cargo containers that you see behind me. But that of course was a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=180.06s)]
*  bubble. The bubble has now exploded and now we're hearing that the projection [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=184.22s)]
*  for store shelves maybe about four to five weeks or so since we start seeing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=188.1s)]
*  the real results of that and then by the end of summer if the tariff situation [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=191.9s)]
*  doesn't change things could get really bad for the American consumer. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  Anna? Steve Patterson important info there thank you very much. So Amy [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=199.82s)]
*  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick he told CNBC yesterday there's at least [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=205.18s)]
*  one trade deal but it still needs approval. This after we've heard 90 [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=209.54s)]
*  deals in 90 days president saying there are 200 deals. Can we believe them? Is [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=214.1s)]
*  there any deal at this point? No Anna I mean there has been so much [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=219.26s)]
*  inconsistency around tariffs altogether and I think that's what's giving a lot of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=224.14s)]
*  a lot of Republicans in particular they're panicking quietly but but they're [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=229.54s)]
*  coming out publicly too. I mean I've spoken to a number of Republicans who [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=235.5s)]
*  are so uncomfortable with the way things are going surrounding the tariffs [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  discussion. You know people are concerned about the midterms more [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=243.38s)]
*  politically speaking they're saying that this this is not a good look for [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=247.46s)]
*  Republicans and what Republicans were promising to Americans coming into you [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=252.34s)]
*  know after the election and so I I don't think that this this is playing out [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=257.98s)]
*  very well for them. Meantime Japan's tariff negotiator says tariff talks with [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=263.02s)]
*  the US will begin tomorrow. He told the press that even at this very moment an [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=267.26s)]
*  executive for an automobile manufacturer told him that he's losing [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=272.34s)]
*  1 million dollars per hour. Just think about that. Have these tariffs already [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=275.85999999999996s)]
*  done long-lasting damage to our political relationships with our allies? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=281.85999999999996s)]
*  I think that it has. I mean the markets are so inconsistent they're so unstable [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=285.46s)]
*  right now and when you talk to people they're expressing as much and I think [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=291.62s)]
*  that is when and you and I have talked about this before Anna but that is when [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=295.62s)]
*  the president will start paying more attention. This is a guy who's you know [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=298.82s)]
*  the ultimate brand or marketer. He reads these headlines. He's focused on what [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=302.86s)]
*  people are saying about it and when there is so much inconsistency and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=307.86s)]
*  instability that's when it starts getting his attention. We'll see how he [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=311.54s)]
*  responds. Thank you so much Amy Parnes. It's nice to see you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=315.74s)]
*  you [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDPP781Zl4&t=328.82s)]
