# Red line defeat! See Trump’s 7-2 Supreme Court loss decoded in LEGAL SPECIAL (Weissman, Melber)
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c)
*  NYU Law professor Melissa Murray, Mary McCord, a former acting assistant attorney general for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=0.0s)]
*  national security at DOJ, and Andrew Weissman, former FBI general counsel and a Mueller prosecutor. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=4.08s)]
*  Mary and Andrew also co-host the MSNBC main justice podcast. And if we wanted to pull out [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=9.84s)]
*  Wikipedia, we could add many more details and accolades about all of your careers. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=14.72s)]
*  Welcome, Andrew. Your thoughts tonight. So I was thinking when you were talking that one way that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=19.28s)]
*  I try and think about this is divide things into the illegal. Another group is the incompetent, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=25.6s)]
*  and another group is the unwise. And it's worth sort of remembering that third bucket. There are [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=34.56s)]
*  a whole bunch of things that are going on that are legal. They just are things that I think many [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=40.96s)]
*  people would find to be sort of outrageous or improvident. I mean, just take, start with day [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=47.52s)]
*  one, which is pardoning people who assaulted our democracy, but actually also assaulted [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=53.76s)]
*  law enforcement. Then there's this bucket of just the incompetent. Abrego Garcia could be an example [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=61.76s)]
*  of that. The claim that the Harvard letter was a mistake, which I think is palpably not true, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=68.72s)]
*  given subsequent actions. But remember, the defense of what happened there is the government [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=75.36s)]
*  saying, oh no, that was a mistake. So that would be gross incompetence as the defense of doing [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=81.76s)]
*  something that Harvard says is legal. And then the thing that we spend a lot of time on is things [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  where the courts have actually said over and over again, this is illegal. But I think it's useful to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=90.72s)]
*  put it in the context of a number of different things, things that could be legal, but just, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  in my view, outrageous in terms of what the administration is doing. So I think it's useful [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=103.28s)]
*  to think about that in terms of all three of those things going on. And you left out one that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=109.44s)]
*  we've talked about on the podcast. Cruel, just cruel, right? Some of these things might be lawful, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  might be unlawful, but they're there with a malevolent intent. And I think an intent to really [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=121.52s)]
*  create multiple tiers of people in this country, and particularly targeted at immigrants, whether [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=127.92s)]
*  lawful or unlawfully here, but also at the LGBTQ community and really sort of anything other than [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=136.48s)]
*  white men, honestly. But on the illegal part, I think one of the key things here that we've just [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=143.2s)]
*  never seen in anything like this magnitude is the steamrolling the other two co-equal branches of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=148.72s)]
*  government, right? Plowing right over congressional statutes, dismantling departments and agencies [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=156.64s)]
*  that not only Congress statuually created, but a president signed those statutes that created [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=162.24s)]
*  those departments and agencies, right? Ignoring appropriations that Congress, under the spending [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=168.0s)]
*  clause, had the constitutional authority to appropriate for certain purposes and just cutting [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=174.4s)]
*  off that funding. So lots of times just ignoring Congress, but also now we are up against the very [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=179.36s)]
*  edge if not having crossed over into violating court orders too, which then you're starting, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=187.44s)]
*  then we're talking about trying to steamroll the judiciary. And Melissa, when you talk about that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=192.88s)]
*  steamrolling, the political messaging over the legal clashes is almost joyous or cartoon villain [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=197.76s)]
*  style. Take a look at Carolyn Livett from earlier this week. Would you ever arrest somebody higher up [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=206.4s)]
*  on the judicial food chain, like a federal judge or even a Supreme Court justice? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=214.88s)]
*  That's a hypothetical question. Again, I'd defer you to the Department of Justice for individuals [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=219.68s)]
*  that they are looking at. So anyone who is breaking the law or obstructing federal law [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=223.84s)]
*  enforcement officials from doing their jobs is putting themselves at risk of being prosecuted. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=228.64s)]
*  You heard it there. They know exactly what they're doing. We haven't really covered this that much. I [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=236.72s)]
*  don't know that many news outlets have covered it, but last week America's first legal, which is [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=241.84s)]
*  Stephen Miller's legal outfit, not an arm of the administration per se, but certainly in league, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=247.04s)]
*  I think filed a lawsuit against John G. Roberts, the chief justice of the United States in his [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=252.08s)]
*  capacity as the chief administrator of the federal judicial conference. And the whole idea behind [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=257.2s)]
*  this lawsuit is that the federal judicial conference, which has always been the administrative [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=263.2s)]
*  branch of the federal courts, is actually a part of the executive branch. And again, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=267.35999999999996s)]
*  it seems wildly implausible that that is the case, but I think the point of this lawsuit is like, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=273.67999999999995s)]
*  we can do whatever we want to you. We can issue these threats against judges. We can say we're [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=278.4s)]
*  not going to abide by judges' orders, and we can also sue the chief justice and make him an actual [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=283.76s)]
*  defendant in his official capacity in a lawsuit. And Mary made a good point about this administration [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=288.23999999999995s)]
*  essentially giving the double middle finger to both Congress and the courts. They've been doing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=294.56s)]
*  that from day one. We don't talk about the TikTok case that much, but the court issued a unanimous [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=298.88s)]
*  opinion upholding Congress's bipartisan ban on TikTok, requiring TikTok to divest itself of [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=304.32s)]
*  Chinese ownership on the Friday before the inauguration. And the president-elect over [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=310.4s)]
*  the weekend said he had a better idea. He was going to do a deal. And to my mind, that was the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=314.88s)]
*  first constitutional crisis, and we don't even really talk about that. Great question. I mean, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=320.56s)]
*  we should be talking about it because it has been an armature of everything that has followed. It was [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=326.32s)]
*  the template for what we are seeing now, just the abject defiance of the courts and Congress on the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=331.92s)]
*  sidelines. So one of the things that you're such a Supreme Court guru is essentially you have the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  administration in the Abrego Garcia case, just as one example, doing something that to my mind is, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=349.28s)]
*  as our colleague Ryan Goodman said, it sort of thrice denied what it is that the courts have [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=356.0s)]
*  said, whether it is the initial court saying, do not send him to El Salvador, whether it's saying [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=364.08s)]
*  you have to give him due process, whether it's saying you have to facilitate his return. That's [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=368.64s)]
*  sort of the thrice. Is the Supreme Court going to stand up? I mean, the number one question we get [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  and I'm sure you get on your podcast as well is, what are the courts going to do? Because they [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=378.88s)]
*  don't have an army. They don't have an army. I think one of the reasons why you saw the court's [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=384.88s)]
*  decision, the earlier decisions around Judge Boasberg's order, they initially said it should [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=390.4s)]
*  not have been filed in Judge Boasberg's court. It should have been filed in Texas, where the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=395.76s)]
*  detainees were before they were expelled to El Salvador. And then they said that Hebeus was the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=399.6s)]
*  appropriate vehicle to go forward. Real questions about whether you can aggregate Hebeus proceedings, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=404.32s)]
*  like they're usually done singly. That means each individual detainee likely has to have their own [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=409.84s)]
*  lawyer in order to proceed. Wacomal. Terrible. But I think part of it is the court a little worried [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=414.96s)]
*  that this administration is not going to listen and they're trying to find ways to kind of play [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  out the clock a little bit. One thing though I do think is encouraging about the court's order that [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=425.12s)]
*  you mentioned, Ari, is it was a seven to two order. I think we ought to wonder why it wasn't nine to [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=430.56s)]
*  zero, why Justices Alito and Thomas weighed in on in favor of the administration. But the fact that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=436.0s)]
*  they issued that ruling at one in the morning and did not wait for Justice Alito to file his dissent, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=442.32s)]
*  that came later, suggests that this court knows that the administration cannot be trusted. The [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=447.44s)]
*  presumption of regularity in the executive no longer exists. So just unpack that a bit more, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=453.2s)]
*  because when those stories break, Melissa, people say, oh my gosh, seven to two and the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=458.64s)]
*  Trump appointees and that's sort of the headline. And my view as both a legal reporter and lawyer is [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=464.96s)]
*  that is the first headline because you say, whoa, seven to two and the Trump folks. But then underneath [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=470.08s)]
*  that is you're hard pressed to find other modern examples in the last decades where to distill what [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=474.96s)]
*  you observed. The court looks over and says not only the president's leadership, but enough people [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=481.84s)]
*  now in the executive branch who might not have been there in 2017, when you think about the range of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=489.11999999999995s)]
*  purging, can't be trusted. In other words, are either bad faith actors, so they're going to find [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=493.28s)]
*  a way around complying, or are full blown liars, which in court we call perjury. What did that mean [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=499.35999999999996s)]
*  when you saw that and how does that affect what you expect the Supreme Court to do in the next few [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=508.16s)]
*  months and then marry? So I'm done predicting what the Supreme Court is going to do full stop, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  but I do think that did raise eyebrows. The fact that they issue that at one in the morning, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  they have a pretty, I wouldn't say leisurely, but they keep business hours, right? To do something [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=524.4s)]
*  at one in the morning was highly unusual. Not waiting for a noted dissent from one of their [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=529.36s)]
*  colleagues, also highly unusual. It was because they knew time was of the essence. If they did [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=534.32s)]
*  not issue that order immediately, who knows what the administration would do. In fact, just to be [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=539.0400000000001s)]
*  clear just how dramatic that was, on the Friday night, one of the government lawyers had said to [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=545.2s)]
*  Judge Boesberg, a district judge, we will not do anything today, but I need to tell you we're [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=552.88s)]
*  reserving the right to do something tomorrow, which means 1201. So in terms of thinking about [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=558.56s)]
*  the sort of tick-tock of what was happening, the Supreme Court knew that if they did not act [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=564.88s)]
*  immediately, those plans could have been taking off and that all these people could end up in [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=569.92s)]
*  El Salvador where the government's saying, we wash your hands of it. Two more points on this. We've [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=574.88s)]
*  emphasized seven too, but there was one part of this where everyone was unanimous. Even in Justice [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=580.4s)]
*  Alito's dissent, joined by Justice Thomas, at the very end after he objects to doing an emergency, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=586.56s)]
*  middle of the night ruling without hearing from the government, without the lower courts having [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=592.16s)]
*  gotten a chance to have it percolate and rule on it, he makes clear the executive must obey our order [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  of April 7th, which was the order that says you have to provide due process, notice and an [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=603.28s)]
*  opportunity to seek relief in the court. So remember, all nine agreed to that multiple times, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=608.56s)]
*  and I just want to keep flagging that over and over. Now, at some point, the decision will be [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=615.12s)]
*  how much process is due, and that's where some of the justices might fracture. The other point is, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=619.6s)]
*  this is still on hold because the Supreme Court said, the seven there said, no further deportations [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=626.88s)]
*  of the putative class from the northern districts of Texas until further order of this court. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=635.36s)]
*  Mary, you look at that altogether and you realize, on many days of the first hundred, the lead thing [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=641.3599999999999s)]
*  in a substantive way, and I don't mean the media. I mean, the most important thing sometimes happening [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=649.68s)]
*  in the federal government was a clash between branches over fights the administration picked [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  that any working lawyer, federalist society or otherwise, would have told them in advance, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=658.56s)]
*  you probably don't have this power. That's one of the remarkable things here, because so many [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=662.4799999999999s)]
*  things he's done, he would have needed in an ordinary world to go to the Office of Legal [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=666.88s)]
*  Counsel at the Department of Justice and get a legal opinion on that. Well, he did these things [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=672.4s)]
*  so fast and furious. Number one, I don't think there was even time for that if he wanted to. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=676.32s)]
*  And secondly, it appears that he's just sort of not paying attention to that office. I mean, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=680.48s)]
*  there are political appointees in that office, and so it always just changed policy-wise, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=685.04s)]
*  administration to administration. But there is no one giving him the advice he needs to stop [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=690.16s)]
*  completely walking into losses in court, or he's ignoring the advice. You know, it could be a [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=696.32s)]
*  combination of both, and it could be he doesn't care, because he seems to be prepared to lose [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=704.88s)]
*  in court, and that's where we're pushing to what's going to happen. I think that's exactly right. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=711.36s)]
*  He is prepared to lose in court, and I think the attacks on the judges are to lay the groundwork [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=716.72s)]
*  in the court of public opinion that the judiciary doesn't actually matter. He keeps harping on this [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=722.4s)]
*  mandate, essentially telling the public, you voted for this, you voted for me, that's the only thing [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=727.84s)]
*  that matters. That's the rule of law, not what these judges have to say. And I want to bring [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=733.84s)]
*  Andrew in, but put some of the numbers on the board. I mentioned that the courts will say, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=738.4s)]
*  we only do law, but other things can matter. We've seen wartime impacts. If you look at the 100-day [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=744.3199999999999s)]
*  approval, Donald Trump doesn't have a strong hand. If you separate the bluster, and we look at the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=752.32s)]
*  actual approval numbers, it is 39% the lowest in 80 years, including his first term. If you look [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=757.7600000000001s)]
*  at this Fox poll, where you ask people about the issues, he loses on overall immigration, overall [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=766.24s)]
*  performance, guns, everything. Border security as a subset is the only place he can find a majority. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=772.96s)]
*  And so, Andrew, does it matter that in a fight where the president says, hey, everyone supports [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=778.08s)]
*  this, that's not true, and judges can see, if they're informed, that he is fading after the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=785.04s)]
*  first 100 days, not rebounding? Look, the salvation here has to be the populace. The salvation [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=792.88s)]
*  is clearly not Congress, which has not been doing anything. The courts can only do so much. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=798.96s)]
*  Remember, a lot of what we're talking about is something that may be illegal, but there's a whole [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=805.76s)]
*  lot that's going on that is legal and just improvident. And so, that's where you really need [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=811.12s)]
*  those polls. I mean, that is why that is ultimately the key issue. But what we're seeing in terms of [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=819.92s)]
*  the attack on the judiciary, I mean, nobody should be surprised. This is a man who is a convicted [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=824.64s)]
*  felon sitting now in the Oval Office. We saw him attack prosecutors and the courts for the entire [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=832.08s)]
*  time that he was under indictment. So now, you're seeing the exact same thing. It's the reason he's [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=841.84s)]
*  attacked the media, anybody who stands up. And part of it, even when he loses, is fear. So the idea of [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=847.76s)]
*  attacking the law firms is that they have the fear they will obey in advance. The attacking of [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=857.5200000000001s)]
*  universities is so you have fear in obeying in advance, even if he loses. The international [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=863.44s)]
*  students, international scholars thinking twice about coming here, scientists thinking, you know [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=870.0s)]
*  what, better to be doing this in Canada, in England, in France. I mean, the repercussions [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=877.2800000000001s)]
*  because of the nature of what he is doing, even if the courts ultimately say you can't do this, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=884.24s)]
*  are enormous. Andrew, as we try to deliver on what we aimed for tonight, the lessons going forward [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=891.52s)]
*  for the things that worked dealing with this Trump legal onslaught. Let's learn from history [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=899.84s)]
*  is the way I look at this, which is all of us at this table were too young for the McCarthy era. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=906.4s)]
*  But I think there are real lessons there for us, which is we are seeing blacklisting, we're seeing [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=912.48s)]
*  the same kind of abuse, the same kind of fear, the same kind of obeying in advance. And I think the [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=920.4s)]
*  lesson, if you think it can't happen again, it is happening now. The idea that, oh, that's something [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=927.6s)]
*  that's just in our history, and we're well beyond that. That is what is happening now, not just [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=933.84s)]
*  blacklisting, but people going along with it, not being the people who stand up. And I think that [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=939.6800000000001s)]
*  is the lesson, which is if you want to be on the right side of history, you need to not be afraid. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  You need to speak. You need to be saying to people who want to use fear as a way to silence you that [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=951.6800000000001s)]
*  you still have a First Amendment right. Well, it's the time for the people, right? I mean, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=959.44s)]
*  you're showing the polling, we're showing more and more protests because the three branches of [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=965.84s)]
*  government, the executive is trying to steamroll the others, the judiciary is trying to put up [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=969.9200000000001s)]
*  roadblocks wherever it can, Congress is asleep, and it's time for the people to demand something [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=975.84s)]
*  more. And I think as we do get closer to 2026, we're going to see more and more and more of that. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=981.0400000000001s)]
*  But in the meantime, it really is incumbent on the three branches to all do their part. And I just [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=986.5600000000001s)]
*  want to quote from Judge Royce Lamberth, a district court judge in D.C., appointed in 1987 by [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=992.56s)]
*  President Reagan in ruling against the Trump administration just a few days ago said, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=999.3599999999999s)]
*  if our nation is to thrive for another 250 years, each coequal branch of government must be willing [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1004.4799999999999s)]
*  to courageously exert the authority entrusted to it by our founders. And he said that after quoting [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  from Federalist number 51. So he's saying we're doing our part, Congress needs to do its part, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1017.84s)]
*  and I'd say another branch, not really a branch, the people. Yeah, and their fundamentals there. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1024.16s)]
*  And I know Andrew got a little concerned when you said you were going to quote, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1029.1200000000001s)]
*  because he's very strict with music quotes. We've been doing that. I trust Mary. Mary was fine. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1032.72s)]
*  We've been doing this together for years and he will patrol a quote. But once we got that it was [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1038.56s)]
*  Federalist papers and judges, we were back on track. Melissa, close us out here. So I agree [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1042.8s)]
*  entirely with Mary. Congress needs to get off the couch and get in the game. But I think the [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1049.28s)]
*  other thing we need to do is stop looking at all of these different episodes as sort of individual [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1054.0s)]
*  isolated episodes. They're all part of a concerted strategy to close down every legal avenue that [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1058.24s)]
*  could be an engine of dissent against this administration. We have DOJ no longer enforcing [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1065.12s)]
*  justice. The whole dismantling of DEI, everything the DOJ has done thus far has been in support of [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1070.72s)]
*  this administration. They have attacked the courts to undermine the court's trust with the public [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1077.04s)]
*  for when the courts actually do speak. They are attacking the whole prospect of the nationwide [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1082.24s)]
*  injunction. So it's going to make it harder for people to challenge the administration's actions. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1086.8s)]
*  They'll have to do it in every different jurisdiction. That'll be entirely unwieldy. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1090.48s)]
*  They are subjugating law firms and they are trying to attack public interest firms too. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1095.1200000000001s)]
*  All of that is about reducing the amount of legal resources available for this fight. It is not [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1099.92s)]
*  a coincidence. This is a strategy to make the law no longer work for the people. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1105.44s)]
*  you [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVRmTx58c&t=1129.92s)]
