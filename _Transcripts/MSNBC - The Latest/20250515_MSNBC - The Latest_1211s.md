# Blowback: Ari Melber on Trump’s ‘losing’ Supreme Court day as his DOJ goes ‘lawless’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM)
*  On this showdown today at the Supreme Court where the Trump administration is trying to reverse [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=0.0s)]
*  a string of losses in a long shot bid to basically rewrite the constitution. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=4.72s)]
*  You can see the outside of the court today, some people gathered, the lawyers arguing for the Trump [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=10.24s)]
*  administration were confronted with their lower court losses. Judges have blocked Trump's now feudal [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=14.8s)]
*  order that claimed he could somehow cancel the citizen protections that are in the U.S. Constitution. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=21.84s)]
*  So this lawyer was pressed on why on behalf of the Trump DOJ they would even try to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=28.720000000000002s)]
*  go and bring this case. In other words, the Supreme Court judges were asking why should we even take [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=36.24s)]
*  what has been this losing case as an appeal? Here is exactly how Justice Kagan crisply put it [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=41.84s)]
*  in her questioning. You're losing a bunch of cases. Why would you ever take this case to us? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=47.84s)]
*  You're losing, why take it to us? That's the Supreme Court justice today referring to how [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=54.48s)]
*  the Trump immigration appeal has been a losing case for Trump and it is not even close. Some [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=62.0s)]
*  stories are complicated, this one is simple. This is because the constitution already very clearly [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=68.24s)]
*  states that people born here are citizens. All persons born or naturalized in the U.S. are citizens, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=74.4s)]
*  period. This has actually been a point of pride that the United States has defined citizenship [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=82.0s)]
*  this way, uniformly. In other words, not by religion or not saying you're born here and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=86.88s)]
*  you're a citizen unless you believe in this or that. No, you're born here, you're a citizen. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=92.08s)]
*  The language is clear, so it's not even close when it comes to what lawyers call interpretation [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=97.2s)]
*  because sometimes there are valid disagreements within the branches of government about what [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=102.96s)]
*  something means. Sometimes it's Congress versus the White House or how an agency, which is part [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=107.6s)]
*  of the White House oversight system or the executive branch, how do they interpret a bill [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  versus the lawmakers who wrote the bill. But this isn't that. Everyone knows the constitution [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=117.36s)]
*  beats a president's executive order and that's not a new or partisan point. If that were not the case, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=124.96s)]
*  every president could theoretically cancel the parts of the constitution that they don't like [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=133.68s)]
*  with a pen. So it's not even close that the constitution's definition of citizenship beats [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=138.88s)]
*  a president trying to disagree with it. And by the way, that's not ideological. If you imagined a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=146.4s)]
*  very liberal president who wanted to rewrite the constitution to allow perhaps easier or more [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  citizenship, they couldn't do it by executive order. And so it is with the reverse. Donald Trump [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=159.04s)]
*  trying, whether it's a matter of messaging or law, trying to cancel out and narrow citizenship in the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=164.56s)]
*  constitution with executive order isn't allowed. Not even close. That's the baseline for Justice [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=171.12s)]
*  Kagan's questioning today, which was so grounded in objective, kind of non-debatable legal history [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=177.04s)]
*  that one of her colleagues, Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch, said admiringly, basically as a positive [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  from the bench, that Kagan asked better questions than he could have. So here is more of her exchange [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  today with the Trump DOJ lawyer. You're losing a bunch of cases, this guy over here, this woman [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=196.88s)]
*  over here, you know, they'll have to be treated as citizens, but nobody else will. Why would you ever [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  take this case to us in a case in which the government is losing constantly? There's nobody [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=209.68s)]
*  else who's going to appeal. They're winning. It's up to you to decide whether to take this case to us. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=216.32s)]
*  If I were in your shoes, there is no way I'd approach the Supreme Court with this case. This [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  is not a hypothetical. This is happening out there, right? Every court has ruled against you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=228.16s)]
*  Every court's ruled against you. You're clearly losing. Why even take it to the Supreme Court [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=234.72s)]
*  for what she is implying? We don't have a ruling yet, but will be a very clear, more prominent [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=239.12s)]
*  total loss. It's clearly a long shot bid from the Trump administration. That's why the order's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=246.24s)]
*  already been blocked everywhere. It is not running anything. It's powerless right now because four [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=251.76s)]
*  judges ruled against Trump, doing what I explained is not even close, trying to rewrite the constitution [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=256.88s)]
*  by executive order to cancel out people's rights. This is a point that the immigrants lawyer emphasized [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=262.0s)]
*  because it goes in their favor how judges have already found this Trump order blatantly unlawful. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=268.0s)]
*  So it was all pretty much dead on arrival legally, not close as a matter of how executive orders work [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=274.4s)]
*  or how citizenship law is handled. So any honest court process would land here, not break from it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=279.92s)]
*  And I can report that tonight, now that we've heard the arguments, the Trump appointees [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=288.16s)]
*  seem to join the whole court's skepticism today. That's clear in the questions. It's clear from a [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=294.08s)]
*  lot of the headlines and summaries from various experts. That includes Gorsuch, as we mentioned, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  and other justices who noted that this Trump long shot bid was already found to be unlawful, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=304.64s)]
*  unconstitutional in the lower courts. So all of that is bad news for the Trump effort, whether they [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=310.64s)]
*  have some other strategy that's been discussed to clog or overlord the courts, overload the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=316.88s)]
*  system, try to kind of make everyone feel frazzled. You know, there's a lot of different ways that you [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=322.96s)]
*  can look at a clear loser and say there must be some other reason. Sometimes there are, other times [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=328.0s)]
*  there are. Other times people just make bad or incompetent legal decisions. But another thing [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=333.28s)]
*  happened here that also cut against some of the Trump efforts. Justice Barrett, a Trump appointee, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  took the example of today's oral arguments, where the Trump folks are on shaky ground, to also ask [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=342.88s)]
*  about Trump's DOJ, suggesting the radical, lawless idea that they could sometimes ignore [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=349.36s)]
*  court precedent. Justice Kagan asked my questions better than I could have. These district judges, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  not just doing universal injunctions, they're finding these actions illegal because they're [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=364.24s)]
*  exceeding existing authority. Did I understand you correctly to tell Justice Kagan that the government [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=369.92s)]
*  wanted to reserve its right to maybe not follow a second circuit precedent, say, in New York, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  because you might disagree with the opinion? Those are tough questions. They're always phrased in the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=381.76s)]
*  sort of dry, respectful manner of the Supreme Court. And as a reminder, Trump lost big, seven to two, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=388.96s)]
*  losing the Trump appointees as well in that emergency order. But if you're not a total [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=394.96s)]
*  Supreme Court nerd, you might not keep track of how they do the hearings. That type of order, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=400.08s)]
*  because it was on an emergency basis, didn't have one of these big oral arguments that are such a [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=405.04s)]
*  big deal, and everyone goes to the court, and we cover it. And so that's relevant today, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=410.0s)]
*  because what we're seeing is some of the possibly pent-up negative questions and arguments from the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=413.92s)]
*  Supreme Court to the Trump team that didn't have a real avenue there. I mean, they did rule against [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  them seven to two and said they've got to facilitate the return of that detainee. And I mentioned a bit [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=424.56s)]
*  more about that in a second. But big picture, this is the chance for these justices to ask these [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=428.88s)]
*  questions. And they clearly have on their mind not only what is this, quote, losing executive order [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=433.92s)]
*  case, as they've been discussing, but the wider thing that's going on here. So let me turn to that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=439.44s)]
*  right now with you. Put it very simple. In a healthy, valid constitutional democracy, politicians [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=445.36s)]
*  do not try to break the law. They don't tend to publicly flout schemes to do that or ignore some [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=452.8s)]
*  court orders. And while America has a very up-and-down history on a lot of issues, most of the time in the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=459.28s)]
*  modern era, that hasn't happened. You'd have to go back to Richard Nixon to find a president who [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=466.32s)]
*  blatantly talked about it and remember he ultimately left office under a cloud for it. In Trump's first [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=471.44s)]
*  term, there were many extreme activities. I bet you remember them. But if you want to be fair about [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=477.84s)]
*  history, during the first term, until we got to the post-election coup era, they generally said they [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=484.64s)]
*  would also follow orders. So we're actually living through something that is distinctly different [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=492.56s)]
*  right now and legally worse. In this second Trump term, the plots about maybe ignoring or flouting [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=498.08s)]
*  court orders are pushed out in the open. We've had multiple officials working for Donald Trump [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=504.96s)]
*  talking that talk, saying maybe they'll ignore some court orders or implying that's the power [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=511.68s)]
*  they might have. They don't have that power. It's a sort of a bad cop, lawless cop approach [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=516.48s)]
*  where they say that stuff while President Trump, who remains quite mindful of PR, will try to exploit [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=521.68s)]
*  that lawless mode. Maybe use it to see if he can shake down or intimidate various officials in [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=529.04s)]
*  courts. But then in his words, he will claim he will still follow the law. He's repeated that even [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  amidst these clashes where his aides say the opposite. So they've been doing that two-step. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=538.48s)]
*  Today's case is about citizenship rights. The judge is blocking Trump's effort. But there is [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=543.44s)]
*  also the wider ongoing immigration powers that Trump is trying to use to seize broader powers. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=548.24s)]
*  He's leading an administration that has shown it will take any potential loophole to duck an order, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=555.6s)]
*  as they did with that broadly worded Supreme Court ruling to facilitate the return of the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=560.24s)]
*  mistakenly deported resident, Kilmar Abrego Garcia. And that case is being litigated separately. So [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=565.36s)]
*  that's its own lane. It has to do with whether they can seize war powers. The Supreme Court said [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=571.92s)]
*  they can't. And whether they will ultimately facilitate his return, which they haven't yet. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=576.64s)]
*  The wider theme, though, that I want you to keep in mind with the Supreme Court [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=582.16s)]
*  today is Trump officials testing those powers and using immigration as the arena that they want [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=585.84s)]
*  to see how far they can go. It's an incendiary approach. And it was a theme today with Trump [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=592.4s)]
*  appointee Barrett. This is kind of interesting. Pressing Trump's top lawyer at the Supreme Court [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=597.6s)]
*  about this longstanding duty to follow court orders and precedents. Now that particular lawyer [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=604.16s)]
*  actually got this job after making those sweeping claims that presidents could be possibly immune [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=611.36s)]
*  from ordering murders, assassination of American opponents. This was the SEAL Team Six scenario. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=616.24s)]
*  That's an expansive claim where Trump's team is not only trying to move the goalposts, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=624.5600000000001s)]
*  as the cliche goes, they're trying to convert the whole stadium into their lawless Trump enterprise [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=629.04s)]
*  if they can get away with it. So today, that kind of approach, however lawless, was discussed in open [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=635.12s)]
*  court. Now the lawyers using pretty kind of arcane, but I think sneaky language to say [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=642.0s)]
*  that while they know the law is follow orders, there are now the Trump lawyer says, quote, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=647.52s)]
*  circumstances where it's not categorical, meaning in Trump's DOJ, maybe they don't follow the orders. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=653.44s)]
*  Our general practice is to respect those precedents, but there are circumstances when [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=662.96s)]
*  it is not a categorical practice. This administration's practice or the longstanding [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=668.64s)]
*  practice of the federal government? As I understand it, longstanding policy of the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=673.52s)]
*  Department of Justice. Yes, that we generally, as it was phrased to me, generally respect circuit [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=676.8s)]
*  president, but not necessarily in every case. No, that is false. When you go work at a longstanding [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=682.2399999999999s)]
*  traditional DOJ, let's say one before the Trump era, you don't get some handbook that says, yeah, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  we follow the precedents a lot of time, but not always. And as you can imagine, as anyone knows [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=696.96s)]
*  from any rule and any job or workplace in history, if somebody has the power to make exceptions, then [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=701.84s)]
*  they'll make exceptions and they might do it in their self interest. They might do it ways that [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  are hurtful or dangerous, but the exceptions swallow the rule. That's another cliche. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=712.08s)]
*  Now, when the rule of law falters, it doesn't always combust. It can, like the outgoing president, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=717.52s)]
*  welcoming clear violence to overthrow his loss and then pardoning those convicted seditionists. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=723.92s)]
*  That's the red line that Trump crossed on day one of this second term. It was a combustible event. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  Other times, the decline of the rule of law can come through this type of jargon. A smart lawyer [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=735.52s)]
*  like Trump's Solicitor General trying to slowly incrementally normalize what you just heard, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=741.68s)]
*  which is not okay, that you can violate some court orders. And notice he chose to give that answer [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=747.52s)]
*  right to the Supreme Court's face today. So take it together. And these arguments were [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=755.28s)]
*  important for the big moments as well as the arcane ones. The big moment, and what you'll [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=761.36s)]
*  probably see in a lot of the coverage in the headlines is a court which does seem today to [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=765.8399999999999s)]
*  have put any Trump partisanship aside and come together on basic law, which is a sign that part [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=769.92s)]
*  of the system may be working. I also got to tell you, it's a low bar, lower than maybe even the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=775.12s)]
*  screen, because of course, presidents don't have the power to cancel the Constitution with executive [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=780.88s)]
*  orders. As Justice Kagan said, why even ask the Supreme Court to deal you a loss on that point? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=787.76s)]
*  But today, we also heard one of the most controversial Trump lawyers of this whole Trump era [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=794.5600000000001s)]
*  call him respectfully Mr. Seal Team Six, because that was the hypothetical he answered. And we [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=800.0s)]
*  heard him cross a new line by telling the justices to their face that the Trump administration does [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=806.1600000000001s)]
*  want to seize power to ignore some court orders, that that will be, he admits, their policy. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=812.08s)]
*  So even as the court pushes back, buckle up for them saying out loud in court what they want to do. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  Emily, your view of what we heard from the Supreme Court today and specifically [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=825.3599999999999s)]
*  what sounded like some justices using today's arguments to also surface [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=830.7199999999999s)]
*  broader issues like are we going to remain a democracy in the second term? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=835.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was an opportunity, as you're saying, for the justices to probe these questions about [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=841.1999999999999s)]
*  whether the government plans to obey court orders and to just behave in the regular manner in which [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=845.68s)]
*  the Justice Department and past administrations have behaved, which is to assume that judges want [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=853.68s)]
*  to hear that they're going to be listened to and that the government cares about what they say and [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=858.4799999999999s)]
*  what they order. That's how it goes in court. Judges run the show, the lawyers show up, and they [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=864.7199999999999s)]
*  try to seem extremely interested in the opinions of the justices. And normally, they say, absolutely, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=870.56s)]
*  we obey court orders. That's what we're here for. So any deviation from that rule is startling. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=877.2s)]
*  And I think that the Supreme Court, especially in light of the decision last summer that granted [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=885.5200000000001s)]
*  presidents, including, of course, President Trump, broad immunity from any kind of criminal liability, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=890.96s)]
*  this same court is trying to probe whether the government is essentially changed and whether [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=896.96s)]
*  the court can kind of trust the good faith actions and words and compliance of the government with [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=903.76s)]
*  court orders going forward. Right. And there are many cases, but on the immigration area, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  the test they've had thus far is they cannot trust them to operate in good faith. There has been no [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=916.16s)]
*  factual or objective good faith effort to return the mistakenly deported detainee, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=922.48s)]
*  which was a seven to two Supreme Court order. Now, there may be times where the word facilitate is [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=929.76s)]
*  loaded with more ambiguity. For example, if you said, let's facilitate the rehiring of 10,000 [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=934.8s)]
*  people to USAID, and you rehire some but not all lawyers and normal people could debate that. Right. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=940.88s)]
*  Here, you got one person, he stuck over there, and you got Trump officials admitting, we're not trying [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=947.92s)]
*  to get him back. And so I think that goes to this context. And Professor, I want to bring you in, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=952.4s)]
*  but also play another Trump appointee, Kavanaugh, also pressing down on compliance. This again, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=956.96s)]
*  to remind viewers, because we got more than one thing going on. This is back to the citizenship [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=964.4000000000001s)]
*  order that's been blocked. And Kavanaugh wanted to make sure what you all you are following, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=968.96s)]
*  that this is blocked. Right. Take a listen. How it's going to work. What do hospitals do [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=972.8000000000001s)]
*  with a newborn? The federal officials will have to figure that out. How? So you can imagine a [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=979.76s)]
*  number of ways that the federal officials could. Such as? We don't know, because the agencies were [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=985.44s)]
*  never given the opportunity to formulate the guidance. They would have 30 days. They're [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=991.7600000000001s)]
*  only going to have 30 days to do this. You think they can get it together in time? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=995.2800000000001s)]
*  This is discussing basically what would happen if they went and did this while they're not doing it [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1001.6s)]
*  now because it's been blocked. Professor, given again, your background in studying democracy [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1006.08s)]
*  issues in general. Plus we have all of these immigration powers that the administration's [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1011.68s)]
*  trying to seize. Your thoughts tonight? What we're seeing, what we've seen since the [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1015.8399999999999s)]
*  beginning of this administration is an administration that doesn't believe in the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1022.4799999999999s)]
*  rule of law. Not one that is simply authoritarian, but one that is systematically violating the law [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1026.8s)]
*  until it gets stopped. And that's not how the rule of law works. I mean, Americans should reflect on [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1035.76s)]
*  why we're one of the richest, most peaceful, most stable democracies in modern world history. It's [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1042.3200000000002s)]
*  not because of the air that we breathe, not because of the water, not because of something [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1051.28s)]
*  in the American character. It's our institutions. It's the strength of our institutions, the strength [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1055.28s)]
*  of our rule of law. And that means that there are a set of laws. And everybody, every citizen, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1061.28s)]
*  every business person, every politician, no matter how powerful, obeys the law. And when told to stop, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1067.84s)]
*  stops. Now there may be, we may disagree with laws, we may try to change them. There may be [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1077.36s)]
*  occasionally differences of interpretation. But the idea that you have a choice, that you could [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1082.24s)]
*  either obey the law or if you don't want to, you don't obey the law and you push it until you're [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1088.32s)]
*  stopped, that's lawlessness. And that's the kind of thing that breaks the rule of law. That breaks [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1093.2s)]
*  institutions. I'll let you finish, but that's gangster, right? That's how gangsters operate [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1099.2s)]
*  on a day-to-day basis. They know there's laws. It's also how most- [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1104.8s)]
*  But if they- Hold on, let me- [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1108.4s)]
*  More than a few countries in the world. It'll be like your class. I'll go right back to you. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1110.72s)]
*  But I just want to be clear about this in plain English. Gangsters follow some laws some of the [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1116.64s)]
*  time. They're not breaking every law all day. But the reason why they have more power in life is [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1121.44s)]
*  people know that they will resort to violence. That they don't view the legal limit on that as [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1127.92s)]
*  pertaining to them. And so societies that end up with gangsters in charge become very dangerous, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1132.96s)]
*  not just for people who are against the gangsters, but eventually, and I'm sure you can educate us on [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1140.0800000000002s)]
*  this, for a heck of a lot of other people within those borders. And so I'm curious, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1145.8400000000001s)]
*  let you finish your point, what it means if we have that lawless mentality now, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1149.76s)]
*  by not only the people in charge at the top, but lawyers and DOJ trying to normalize it. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1154.48s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even remember my point, but I think you said it better than I did, Ari. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1160.32s)]
*  The point is when governments decide that it's a choice, that they can decide whether they're [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1164.24s)]
*  going to obey the law or not, you can very quickly weaken institutions. And it is a lot harder. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1169.76s)]
*  And I study Latin America for a living. It is a lot harder to break institutions, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1176.24s)]
*  to weaken institutions, than to build strong ones. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7vf_Y6PuM&t=1181.76s)]
