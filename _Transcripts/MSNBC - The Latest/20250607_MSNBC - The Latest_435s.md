# ‘You don’t need a permission slip to call out the president’s character’: Fmr. Trump admin. staffer
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY)
*  That former staffer is Miles Taylor and he is joining me now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=0.0s)]
*  He was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security during Trump's first term and he wrote the anonymous New York Times op-ed [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=3.5s)]
*  criticizing Trump, though he has now set up a legal defense fund at end [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=10.44s)]
*  presidential revenge org and miles [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=14.98s)]
*  Welcome. There's a lot of pressure on you right now and a lot to get into here, but I do appreciate your time [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=18.56s)]
*  I want to just get your thoughts from kind of a national security point of view on the fallout of the Trump [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=23.48s)]
*  Musk public spat. I mean first what ran through your mind when you saw it playing out? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=30.32s)]
*  Look, you know, it's the biggest reality TV show in the world right now [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=35.12s)]
*  And so like anyone else, I think we were watching that at home and saying this is a very dramatic [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=39.6s)]
*  episode to witness but more fundamentally for us because [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=45.56s)]
*  We've been in on the receiving end of these orders of presidential revenge [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=49.64s)]
*  You know our second thought as a family was well [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=54.28s)]
*  It seems like the likeliest thing to happen next is [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump and his allies are going to try to get revenge against Elon Musk and that probably means him undertaking some of the same [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=60.72s)]
*  Unconstitutional tactics that he's directed against me and my former colleague Chris Krebs and law firms and universities. Why is that significant? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=67.88s)]
*  Well, because if the richest man of the world is targeted by presidential revenge and has to fight back against it [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=75.04s)]
*  That may help the others who have been in the crosshairs of the president fight back against those unlawful orders [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=81.42s)]
*  So I'll admit to you Alex [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=88.68s)]
*  My first thoughts really were selfish there that if if Elon gets targeted by this [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=89.74000000000001s)]
*  It may help out the others in some ways that are trying to evade unlawful retaliation [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=95.14s)]
*  Musk's business empire the the national security tentacles if you will reach into the military with Starlink projects for the US government as well as [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=102.1s)]
*  Ukraine and other allies spy network projects with projects rather with CIA and Defense Department [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=110.12s)]
*  Musk also got access to data from government systems during his doge tenure. He's got connections to China [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=117.64s)]
*  Miles, what are the implications if he decides to somehow wield that power? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, look, I mean Elon's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=129.6s)]
*  Record here isn't perfect and there was all kinds of conflicts of interest when he came into government [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  But you know, I think the thing if I had a moment to advise him [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=137.2s)]
*  I would say you may be the richest man in the world [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=141.0s)]
*  But there's no one richer than the United States federal government [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=143.76s)]
*  And so if the Trump administration wants to target Elon Musk in retaliation for the things he said [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=147.28s)]
*  There's no underestimating the vast authorities and powers on behalf of the US government [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=154.44s)]
*  And so I do think it's not unreasonable to assume the Trump administration will accuse Musk of being compromised by [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=160.16s)]
*  China that they will potentially cancel contracts [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=167.16s)]
*  There have been suggestions of seizing his businesses and even deporting Elon Musk [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=170.56s)]
*  Some of those things may seem outlandish until they actually happen [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=174.76s)]
*  So I would not think that this is something that's likely to be buried over the weekend [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=179.0s)]
*  There's a lot of hurt feelings here on both sides [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=184.24s)]
*  But it goes much beyond the hurt feelings of two men in a way that could affect [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=186.56s)]
*  potentially millions and millions of people and the national security of the United States [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=190.88s)]
*  Let's see, we're going to talk about Trump's order against you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=194.72s)]
*  You've asked two inspectors general this week to investigate whether DOJ and DHS are carrying out what you argue is an unconstitutional order [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=197.8s)]
*  targeting you not for a crime but for dissent [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=205.4s)]
*  So what is your response to Trump accusing you of leaking sensitive information and saying your conduct could possibly violate the espionage act? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=208.84s)]
*  Well, my first comment Alex would be it's very ironic coming from Donald Trump [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=217.72s)]
*  A man who was accused of absconding from the White House with stacks of highly classified information [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=222.6s)]
*  I can say with great confidence and I know that no one would doubt me in this [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=229.16s)]
*  that I of course did not leave government like Donald Trump with stacks of classified documents [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=233.4s)]
*  because you learn in the national security community, you do something that's stupid and you go to prison [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  My criticisms of Donald Trump were not classified [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=243.64s)]
*  It is not classified to criticize the president of the United States and you don't need a permission slip to call out the president's character [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=248.52s)]
*  and that's why I came forward seven years ago is to say I think Donald Trump is operating impetuously [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=257.96s)]
*  He's a danger to the country and if re-elected he will engage in a campaign of revenge using the powers of the presidency [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=263.48s)]
*  and now he's gone and proven my point [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=270.76s)]
*  What I find very disturbing though Alex is the language he's using to come after me and my family and Chris Krebs [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=272.76s)]
*  is so Orwellian that it's almost comical except for the fact that it's real [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=279.08s)]
*  There are very real legal implications here and not just for us [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=283.88s)]
*  This is much bigger than the Taylor family because this is a direct attack on free speech in this country [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=287.4s)]
*  Donald Trump is showing that if he wants to target anyone for criticizing him [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  He can sign with the stroke of a pen an executive order and investigate you in a federal probe [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=299.08s)]
*  Now legal scholars around the country have told me this is so nakedly unconstitutional [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=304.12s)]
*  and that's why we are taking legal steps to try to shine a light and expose some of that illegal activity [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=308.92s)]
*  and hopefully get orders like this reversed so they can never happen again [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=315.16s)]
*  How did you learn of the executive memo? I'm curious what you felt in that moment [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=319.16s)]
*  I mean did your blood run cold and what has your life been like since then? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=323.48s)]
*  Well Alex look we because we've spent years my wife and I talking about the likelihood of presidential [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=327.47999999999996s)]
*  revenge if Donald Trump won the presidency we expected at some point to be targeted for speaking out [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=333.79999999999995s)]
*  and we were prepared for that we did not expect it to go to this level this quickly [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=338.67999999999995s)]
*  We didn't expect the president to be ordering investigations into critics for First Amendment protected speech [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=343.4s)]
*  That's actually never happened in the 249 years of America's existence [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  No president has ever done that and so as we were watching the news in real time I think it hit both of us [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  that this was going to be not just a dramatic political episode but it would upend our lives [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=361.8s)]
*  and I've had to leave my job because of it my wife had to return to work you know financially [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=366.92s)]
*  it's put us in an extremely difficult position and we faced renewed death threats against our family [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=372.03999999999996s)]
*  and we've had to take that into account and we've had to stay in different places because of that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=377.88s)]
*  So we're grappling with that at the moment I will say the one silver lining of it all is we have been [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=382.91999999999996s)]
*  floored by the support from across the country people have come out of the woodwork to help us [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=389.0s)]
*  make this possible this legal step that was taken this week to notify the watchdogs and folks have [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=394.44s)]
*  gone to end presidentialrevenge.org and they have effectively crowdfunded our defense and that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  has meant the world I mean that has saved our family financially from the possibility of having [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=406.2s)]
*  to sell our home to pay for lawyers to protect our freedom [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhSI3qS0cY&t=410.76s)]
