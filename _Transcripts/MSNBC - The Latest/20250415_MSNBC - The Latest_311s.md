# Trump admin ‘redefining laws’: Breaking down Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s case
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU)
*  So, Katherine, so much to ask you about, but just on the top of the question is, what do [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=0.0s)]
*  you think are the judges' options today here? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=3.94s)]
*  Well, first, I want to say that the government did those comments yesterday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  The government put a link to the video of that press conference yesterday in the filing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=11.0s)]
*  that they filed yesterday. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=15.72s)]
*  And in that filing... [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=16.72s)]
*  So it's on the record. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=17.72s)]
*  It's on the record. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=18.72s)]
*  They even quoted the president of El Salvador saying he can't smuggle a terrorist into the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=19.72s)]
*  United States, and of course he's not going to do it, meaning return Mr. Garcia. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=24.64s)]
*  And our government is going to hang on that press conference and what came out the mouth [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=29.58s)]
*  of the El Salvadoran president. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=34.379999999999995s)]
*  The judge is actually constrained by the Supreme Court. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=36.18s)]
*  The Supreme Court's decision was really, to use a legal term, loosey-goosey. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=38.78s)]
*  Okay, can I ask you a question on that? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=42.94s)]
*  Because there is an overlap, or maybe not an overlap, but there is a cause and then [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=44.82s)]
*  an effect reaction, this judge and what the Supreme Court decided. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=49.66s)]
*  Can you kind of clear up one of those, both of those aspects? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=54.06s)]
*  The Supreme Court rules. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=57.26s)]
*  They're the highest court in the land. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=58.74s)]
*  And they made a point of saying in their decision that her use, the judge's use, of the term [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=60.18s)]
*  effectuate in the district court's order is unclear and may exceed the district court's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=66.34s)]
*  authority. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=72.38s)]
*  So the Supreme Court now instead uses the term facilitate. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=73.38s)]
*  Effectuate means make it happen. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=77.5s)]
*  Facilitate means make it easier for it to happen. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=79.9s)]
*  So that's the United States Supreme Court said that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=82.64s)]
*  And the Supreme Court also said that the judge has to have due regard for the deference [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=84.98s)]
*  owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=89.9s)]
*  So that's what the United States government is hanging on to, that the judge really didn't [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=93.78s)]
*  direct them to effectuate and bring Mr. Garcia back. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  It said facilitate. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=102.62s)]
*  A.G. Bondi, we didn't play that clip. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=103.94s)]
*  She said yesterday that if El Salvador wants to return him, we will facilitate it by providing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=106.06s)]
*  a plane. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=112.02000000000001s)]
*  So the judge is really constrained by that decision by the Supreme Court. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=113.06s)]
*  You say it's wishy washy in so many ways. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=118.06s)]
*  But does the Supreme Court ruling say, just for breaking it down to us, return him? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=120.5s)]
*  I would argue that saying facilitate his release from custody means the United States has to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=130.3s)]
*  make it easier. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=135.34s)]
*  They, the Supreme Court, did not like the term effectuate, which means make it happen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=136.34s)]
*  The facilitate means make it easier for him to return. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=140.2s)]
*  But they're going to hang, the United States government, on what El Salvador president [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=143.44s)]
*  said yesterday. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  The only one who asked him a direct question about returning him was a reporter. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=148.83999999999997s)]
*  So no one in that room, including the president of the United States, said, will you please [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  return him? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  Alexi, is this is a fight the Trump administration wants to have, you think? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, what do they see as the upside here? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=160.83999999999997s)]
*  I mean, we know that they love fighting. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  And more than that, they love being defiant and kind of redefining words and laws and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=165.86s)]
*  citizenship in this country. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=171.38000000000002s)]
*  What we saw yesterday from President Bukele was certainly a power play or a power move. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=173.86s)]
*  But it was one that we, through President Trump, handed him on a silver platter by deporting [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=178.82000000000002s)]
*  our own people and refusing to protect our own citizens from deportation to a country [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=183.8s)]
*  that they don't even belong to. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=189.56s)]
*  This is a fight that Trump wants because he has been railing against immigration. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=191.82000000000002s)]
*  He made mass deportations a centerpiece of his campaign in this last cycle. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=195.82000000000002s)]
*  And I think that people took him seriously, but maybe not literally. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=201.66s)]
*  And we are seeing what the literal interpretation of that mass deportation strategy is and how [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=205.74s)]
*  far they're willing to fight and twist words and lie to make it a reality. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=211.14000000000001s)]
*  Alexi, I think it's important that we underline that the president has talked about, as recently [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=215.78s)]
*  as yesterday in his meeting with Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, his thoughts [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=221.36s)]
*  about possibly one day sending U.S. citizen criminals, according to the president, to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=226.56s)]
*  this secote prison. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  But so far, all of the people, the hundreds of people that have been sent to the secote [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  from the United States were not U.S. citizens. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  And so the question is, this is a fight that the White House... [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  What is their upside here, Alexi? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=248.8s)]
*  Well, the upside, I think, is the raw politics of it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=251.4s)]
*  And honestly, recreating, reconstructing this country, who belongs, who's considered a [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=254.8s)]
*  quote unquote real American and who is not, it is again something that President Trump [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=260.92s)]
*  has hung his entire legacy on. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=266.64s)]
*  But now with the likes of Stephen Miller and others supporting him, aiding and abetting [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=268.92s)]
*  every wish, of course, this is something they want for raw politics, legacy, securing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=273.6s)]
*  And also, frankly, they have a very clear vision of who this country is, who Americans [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=279.24s)]
*  are, what we should and shouldn't look like. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=284.96s)]
*  And it looks a lot more like them than it does like us on this panel. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjwnhJMi9uU&t=287.88s)]
