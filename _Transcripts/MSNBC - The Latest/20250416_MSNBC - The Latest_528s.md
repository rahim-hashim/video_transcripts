# ‘We got ‘em scared!’: AOC and Bernie draw massive crowds in red states
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI)
*  On the way here, we got a very interesting piece of news, which is that some of those Republican members, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=0.0s)]
*  some of those Republican House members that we had visited, they just led a letter [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=8.08s)]
*  warning the Republican leadership saying, we don't know if we can vote for Medicaid cuts now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=13.6s)]
*  That's you, Missoula. That's you, Montana. That's you, Colorado. That's you, Arizona. That's you, California. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=19.56s)]
*  That's you, the people. We got them on their back foot. We got them scared. We got them running. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=35.4s)]
*  But our job is not done. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=48.36s)]
*  Today, Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez continued their [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=51.8s)]
*  fight oligarchy tour, drawing an overflow crowd for rally Missoula, Montana. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=55.48s)]
*  It's been the scene everywhere they've been this week in the red states of Montana, Idaho, and Utah [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=60.04s)]
*  in a Republican district in Folsom, California, tapping into this growing energy of resistance [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  to Trump's agenda around the country. Joining me now, former Democratic Senator of Missouri, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=69.72s)]
*  Claire McCaskill and Michelle Goldberg on the New York Times, where she's been writing this week [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=74.44s)]
*  about the vibe shift against the right. Let me start with you, Claire. One of the things that's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=78.12s)]
*  weird about this moment is that there's these two parallel tracks of normal politics and abnormal [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=82.12s)]
*  politics. So one level of it is these deeply abnormal politics, just the stuff, the flagrant [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=88.6s)]
*  violations of the rule of law, the autocratic executive orders leveled at the law. Things [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=94.28s)]
*  we've never seen before. Then there's like, oh, Republicans are in power and want to cut taxes [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=99.32s)]
*  for rich people and cut Medicaid. It's like, oh yeah, I've seen this movie before. I've been [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=103.0s)]
*  this movie before. Yes, you've been there before. And one of the things that I think is a little, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=106.92s)]
*  a difficult reality to get your head around for me is that there's much more purchase in Democrats [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=111.24s)]
*  waging battles on the terrain of normal politics than on the range, the terrain of abnormal politics. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=116.44s)]
*  I think so. And I'm not saying, listen, I'm not here to defend that the Democrats are doing a great [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=123.64s)]
*  job standing up to this crazy stuff that's happening, this destroying of our constitution [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=129.0s)]
*  and the norms that we hold dear, the values we hold dear. But there are two things they're [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=136.2s)]
*  thinking about. One is how do we stop them? And two, how do we get power back? And when you talk [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=141.96s)]
*  about that, I mean, listen, I noticed the difference between that crowd and the crowd at Chuck Grassley's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=149.4s)]
*  town hall. Those were a lot of young people. And you're seeing a lot of young people getting [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=155.16000000000003s)]
*  excited, which is great. But you know, the other thing you're seeing in the polls, Chris, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=160.52s)]
*  you're seeing independence absolutely turning massively against Donald Trump by wide margins. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=164.44s)]
*  And that's really what I think a lot of folks in states like Pennsylvania and North Carolina [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=172.68s)]
*  and places where it's hard to win statewide if you're a Democrat are paying really close attention. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  Totally. And I think on, you know, I think cost of living coming after Social Security, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=182.84s)]
*  Medicare, like Medicaid, this is like, you know, bread and butter, real brass tacks stuff is the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=186.44s)]
*  stuff that I think most of the evidence suggests has been had the most bite, right? In those fights, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=190.76s)]
*  not just independence, though, I thought this was interesting. And this is a you gov poll. I don't [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=195.56s)]
*  want to make too much of this, but he's Trump is down 15 points among Republicans in this you gov [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  poll. And again, I think everyone thinks it's impossible for him to lose Republican support. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=204.2s)]
*  He's going to be at 90%. But he was in the 70s and 72. Now again, that's one poll. But you wrote [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=209.0s)]
*  a really interesting column this week where it was just like picking up on some voices on the right [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=213.64s)]
*  who were right. Not a lot. Not a lot. Like people being like, yeah, I don't love this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  Right. And I mean, what's interesting is that these people were some of the sort of leading [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=223.32s)]
*  indicators, at least to me, that there had been this energy on the right a few years ago. They [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  were people who were, you know, kind of very disgusted by wokeness, very disgusted by the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=232.83999999999997s)]
*  Democrats, people who were kind of the intellectual vanguard in some ways, and who had not previously [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=236.92s)]
*  been kind of like avowed gung hoed Trumpers. Right. And who were, you know, kind of part of this, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  who were kind of leading indicators of this style of right wing politics that merges, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=250.6s)]
*  you know, the kind of insane nativism of Stephen Miller with they kind of anti science health [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=255.23999999999998s)]
*  nuttary of a R.F.K. Junior. You know, they were they they sort of were at the intersection of this [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=262.2s)]
*  movement, at least some of them were. And to see them turn against it and part in in some ways, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=268.28s)]
*  in the same way that you sort of saw these early defectors from the Democratic Party, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=275.08s)]
*  longtime liberals who were like, you know, very critical of these socially progressive politics, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=279.4s)]
*  they feel like they're being lied to. And there's something intellectually insulting at being forced [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=285.88s)]
*  to pretend that any of this makes sense. And I do think the tariffs are a kind of key watershed [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=291.24s)]
*  moment here because they're just so they are genuinely indefensible. Even if you adopt like [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  they're internally inconsistent, like they make no sense in and of themselves. Like you can't [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=303.24s)]
*  crawl into some intellectual space where you could defend them because they're at war with themselves. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=307.56s)]
*  And then when you get back to that bread and butter thing of like prices are not going down. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=312.52s)]
*  He said they would go down. Yeah. And the interesting thing in that same poll, because I [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=317.0s)]
*  took a close look at the cross-taps in that poll, the interesting thing that same poll was the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  question, do you think the country is out of control? The chaos around this in some ways, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=325.23999999999995s)]
*  because we haven't really felt the price increases yet. They'll come. But the chaos surrounding it, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=331.08s)]
*  the volatile swings in the stock market and a whole bunch of folks have 401k. And it is not [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=336.52s)]
*  just the wealthy that are being impacted by this and social security offices. Nobody's answering [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=343.0s)]
*  the phone. The lack of competence is really hurting him, especially for a guy who's dealt [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=347.72s)]
*  from a position of strength. Well, chaos doesn't show strength. Chaos shows weakness. And I think [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=354.68s)]
*  that's why you see 60% of the independence in this poll saying the country's out of control. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=361.32s)]
*  Yeah. And it's particularly on this China thing, right? Where he's like entered into this very [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=365.8s)]
*  high stakes game of chicken. You know, without lining up any of the sort of pieces that you [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=369.24s)]
*  would need. No, right. I mean, made him mad, right? First. And also like alienate all your allies is [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=375.48s)]
*  what you were talking before, kind of turn yourself into this burgeoning global pariah and then say, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=382.44s)]
*  oh, wait, we need you to join an anti-China coalition in order to write, you know, or just [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=388.36s)]
*  the fact that they, you know, they say all of a sudden, oh, we're going to exempt smartphones. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=394.44s)]
*  We're going to exempt computers, laptops. Like, like, like nobody thought of this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=400.2s)]
*  And there's also this way in which, you know, again, to the people that are inside and I don't, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=407.24s)]
*  you know, I don't know what that is that floor 40%, 40, 42, 38, right? When it actually matters [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=411.32s)]
*  where it is, you know, everything can be sort of spun as like the master plan that like he's got [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=416.92s)]
*  some plan. And I've seen interviews with folks who say I trust him. And again, a lot of what we do [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=422.2s)]
*  in politics is trust. I don't even really blame people for that so much. But if you're not in the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=426.68s)]
*  40, 41, 42%, it like if he climbs down against China, it's going to be hard to spin as a win, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=431.8s)]
*  I guess is my point. Well, it's going to be hard to spin as a win if everybody's prices go up, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=439.24s)]
*  right? Which is why he's caught between a rock and a hard place. It's like the win is the prices go [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=444.2s)]
*  up or you retreat. Has somebody told him that you can't ramp up manufacturing in two years? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=448.2s)]
*  Has somebody told him you can't build the factories or hire the people, especially [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=453.4s)]
*  if he's kicking huge numbers of people that are willing to take those jobs out of the country? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=457.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that's what's so crazy about this is that he actually has alienated the if you were [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=460.76s)]
*  a country out there right now, would you trust to deal with Donald Trump? No, no. And of course, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=467.64s)]
*  they're not. And that's what the damage he's done that he can't claw back. That's why I think [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=472.12s)]
*  yes, we've got to keep doing town halls. Yes, we've got to keep speaking out. Yes, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=477.88000000000005s)]
*  we've got to resist. We also have to keep an eye on the fact that people in the middle are going [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=481.48s)]
*  to go, okay, I've had enough of this chaos and incompetence. And you know what? The rent's too [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=486.76000000000005s)]
*  damn high. Yeah. I mean, I think that and I think it's interesting to see AOC at that event, which [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=491.8s)]
*  is a base event, but is on focusing on Medicaid, right? Because like that is a place that like [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=496.68s)]
*  frontline members are vulnerable. And they know that very well. They're going to press that [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=502.04s)]
*  advantage. Claire McCaskill, Michelle Goldberg, great to see you. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtP8GbabgI&t=504.52s)]
