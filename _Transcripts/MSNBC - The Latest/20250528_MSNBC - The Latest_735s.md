# ‘Brazen corruption’: Trump pardons reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk)
*  I want to bring in NBC's Ryan Reilly, Ken Vogel as a New York Times reporter who wrote [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=0.0s)]
*  that article on Paul Walsack, and Anthony Coley as former director of the DOJ's Office [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=4.84s)]
*  of Public Affairs under President Biden and an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  I want to start with the Chrisleys Ryan. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=14.76s)]
*  We heard the president say he didn't know them, so how did they end up on his radar? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=17.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, that RNC appearance was a big part of this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=21.64s)]
*  And then also more recently, there was a Fox News interview that the president's daughter [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  and Lara Lara Trump did with the daughter as well. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=28.939999999999998s)]
*  And again, comparing them to the Trumps using this line that she alleged that prosecutors [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=32.18s)]
*  used that she claims they called them the Trumps of of the South and basically making [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=36.46s)]
*  that direct comparison. And because of Donald Trump's experience in this in this realm with [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=41.66s)]
*  political political cases, cases being brought against him by the federal government, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=46.5s)]
*  that certainly seems to be an argument. He's very eager to sort of take up. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=51.22s)]
*  We saw it with another case involving a sheriff again this week. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=55.14s)]
*  It was another person who supported him, who we also was able. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=58.5s)]
*  He also pardoned what the government had said during this case is that the Chrisleys spend [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=62.3s)]
*  the money on luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel and use fraudulent [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=66.82s)]
*  loans to pay back old ones. After spending all the money, Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=71.58s)]
*  and walked away with more than 20 million of those fraudulently fraudulently obtained [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=75.94s)]
*  loans. The White House said in a statement that the president is always pleased to give [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=80.3s)]
*  well-deserving Americans a second chance, especially those who have been unfairly targeted [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=84.22s)]
*  or overly prosecuted by an unjust justice system. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=89.06s)]
*  So now that we have a pardon attorney in place who is also sort of very sympathetic to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=93.26s)]
*  Donald Trump and has been supportive of the January 6th defendants, for instance, as well as [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=98.86s)]
*  a pardon czar in the White House, that sort of streamlined process involving politically [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=103.98s)]
*  connected individuals at least seems to be up and running in terms of turning these cases [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=109.18s)]
*  over very quickly, Chris. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=114.26s)]
*  Ryan Reilly, thank you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=115.9s)]
*  So, Anthony, when the president said that they had been given a pretty harsh treatment based [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=117.22s)]
*  on what I'm hearing, is that how pardons are typically decided based on what I'm hearing? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=122.7s)]
*  No, not at all. I think what we have here, Chris, is we have brazen corruption at the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=129.66s)]
*  highest level of the other Justice Department of the Trump administration. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=135.02s)]
*  What's so interesting also as well is that presidential pardons are typically like the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=140.54s)]
*  get out of jail free cards, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=146.78s)]
*  And what Trump is doing here, he understands the value of these things and he's not giving [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=149.26s)]
*  them away for free. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=155.26s)]
*  He wants to he wants to benefit in some way politically and legally. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=157.22s)]
*  And that's what we have in both of these cases. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=161.54s)]
*  I find it very interesting to me that he announced the pardon of the Chrisley's just [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=163.85999999999999s)]
*  hours after Ken Vogel in the New York Times posted this blockbuster story. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=170.14s)]
*  And I think personally, you know, nobody can get into the mind of Donald Trump. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=175.78s)]
*  But I think they I think they understood the political liability that Ken's article [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  poses. And I think they were honestly just trying to get ahead of it to divert attention away [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=187.14s)]
*  from these very hard facts and Ken's blockbuster piece. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=191.46s)]
*  Anthony, I want to play a little of what the Chrisley's daughter, Savannah, said on Fox News [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=194.94s)]
*  just 10 days ago. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  Originally, they were not going to prosecute because they said it was very weak. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=202.58s)]
*  They didn't have the evidence that they needed to prosecute, that it just it wasn't a case. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=206.98000000000002s)]
*  It took nine years to issue a federal indictment. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=211.9s)]
*  Both prosecutors were Democrats. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=214.54000000000002s)]
*  They have donated to Democratic candidates. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=216.62s)]
*  And from at trial, we knew it was game over. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=220.73999999999998s)]
*  We should note that the Chrisley's were convicted by a jury in Georgia after a trial that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=224.94s)]
*  lasted nearly three weeks. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=230.82s)]
*  That said, they were convicted in twenty twenty two. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=232.14s)]
*  So she's talking about the DOJ that you worked for. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=234.5s)]
*  So how would you respond to those allegations? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  I got to tell you, I worked at Maine Justice and this is not even a case that rose to the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=241.89999999999998s)]
*  ranks of the Maine Justice Department, certainly not in any type of meeting that I was in, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=246.22s)]
*  where typically if a case generates headlines, you know, it's it's it's flagged for the senior [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=251.54s)]
*  staff of the Justice Department early on in the in the morning meetings with the attorney [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=258.54s)]
*  general. Honestly, I'd never heard of this case. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=263.22s)]
*  And I think what we have here is just people who understand that if they want to get an [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=265.02s)]
*  audience in front of this president, then they just need to they need to echo his language [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=270.14s)]
*  about persecutions despite what the facts are, despite what the law says. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=276.38s)]
*  And that's what this is really all about. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=280.58s)]
*  And Donald Trump understands that, you know, there's some political benefit for him [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=282.86s)]
*  pardoning these social media stars. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  Right. And just hours after he did this, this was the top trending item on social media. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=293.02s)]
*  And he just wants to benefit politically from it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=298.82s)]
*  And I think this is really what this is all about. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=301.14s)]
*  So let's go to the reporter with the blockbuster stories, Ken, in the case of Paul Walsack, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=303.38s)]
*  you've done a lot of digging on this guy and he pleaded guilty, we should say. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=308.94s)]
*  What can you tell us about him and how his mother factored into this pardon? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=313.94s)]
*  Yeah, it was really interesting. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=319.98s)]
*  The pardon application, which came in around the time that Trump was inaugurated, dealt as [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=321.06s)]
*  much with his mother and his mother's political activity as it did with his own crimes and trying [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=327.18s)]
*  to explain them away. As you noted, he did plead guilty. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=332.14s)]
*  So it's always tricky when you have these folks who are making the claim as a number of the people [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=335.22s)]
*  who have received pardons and commutations from President Trump in his second term have made that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=339.86s)]
*  they were politically prosecuted because of their support for President Trump. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=344.66s)]
*  Well, you pleaded guilty. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=350.58s)]
*  So and that wasn't really a part of the guilty plea. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=352.1s)]
*  So it's interesting to see them raise it now when they know, as you as you alluded to, that it will get [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=355.66s)]
*  traction with Trump in the case of Elizabeth Fago, who is Paul Walsack's mother. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=360.54s)]
*  It was pointed out in his pardon application that she had been a major fundraiser for Republicans, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=368.22s)]
*  including President Trump, raising millions of dollars for the campaigns of these Republicans, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=373.58s)]
*  hosting at least three fundraisers for President Trump. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=378.38s)]
*  Even more than that, they noted in this pardon application, her involvement in a plot to expose [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=381.98s)]
*  the addiction diary of actually Biden in the run up to the 2020 election. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=390.62s)]
*  That's interesting because that plot actually drew FBI scrutiny and ultimately two people who were [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=396.1s)]
*  involved with it, who actually brought the diary to a fundraiser at Elizabeth Fago's house, pleaded [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=401.58s)]
*  guilty in that case. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=407.86s)]
*  So nonetheless, they seem to think that flagging this as something that she was involved in would [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=409.26s)]
*  attract attention from President Trump and potentially make the case that they're trying to make here, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=416.3s)]
*  that they successfully made here, that Paul Walsack was prosecuted because of the political activity [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=422.18s)]
*  and support for Trump from his mother. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=430.1s)]
*  Let me ask you a little bit more about what you said about the pardon application, because part of what [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=433.42s)]
*  you wrote is this. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=437.46s)]
*  It's suggested that Donald Trump Jr. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=438.82s)]
*  as well as Kimberly Guilfoyle and other Trump allies supported his clemency. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=440.85999999999996s)]
*  They all agreed, according to the application, that the only reason Mr. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=444.85999999999996s)]
*  Walsack was prosecuted criminally was that he was the son of a prominent Trump supporter. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=449.34s)]
*  Do they have any evidence at all of that? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=455.34s)]
*  I mean, there's none that that I was aware of that was cited in that pardon application. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=460.58s)]
*  There is sort of generally this idea that the IRS in particular looks for high profile people to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=465.14s)]
*  criminally prosecute to make an example of. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=471.3s)]
*  And so the argument here would seem to be that he was high profile, Paul Walsack, because of his mother, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=474.02s)]
*  not necessarily because of him. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=481.21999999999997s)]
*  It's a bit of an attenuated, maybe even you could say tortured case. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=482.97999999999996s)]
*  But nonetheless, it does really resonate with this argument that Anthony and you have have laid out or this [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=487.62s)]
*  theme that Trump is looking for people to pardon or grant clemency to who are supporters of his, who have [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=496.34s)]
*  made this case that he has made about his own prosecutions, that they were politically motivated. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=502.74s)]
*  In fact, I'll even throw in one more detail on the Chrisley's pardon application. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=507.9s)]
*  It actually links their their prosecution to prosecutors who have connections to Fonny Willis, the Fulton County [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=512.5799999999999s)]
*  District Attorney, who prosecuted Trump and and some of his supporters on the election on the election, the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=520.5s)]
*  twenty twenty election interference case. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=527.9399999999999s)]
*  So you see what the buttons are that folks who are seeking pardons think that they need to press to get Trump's [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=530.5s)]
*  attention. And in a lot of these cases, they're right. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=537.38s)]
*  You know, Anthony, let me jump in here. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=540.82s)]
*  Go ahead. Let me jump in here if I can. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=542.94s)]
*  So an important thing in Kenneth's piece is that number one, Walzac pleaded guilty. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=545.66s)]
*  He was not found guilty by a jury of his peers. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=550.46s)]
*  He was not found guilty because of some actions of some type of radical judge. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=553.66s)]
*  He pleaded guilty voluntarily. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=558.5s)]
*  The second thing to to remember here is this is not a victimless crime. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=560.58s)]
*  This guy was accused of stealing money, not just from rich lawyers, but from nurses and nursing home age. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=565.34s)]
*  These are hourly employees who thought that they were paying money into Social Security so that they could [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=572.98s)]
*  retire with dignity. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=579.66s)]
*  I mean, this is supposed to be Donald Trump's base. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=581.34s)]
*  But what we have here is a president. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=584.1s)]
*  We have a White House who says he's had the government by the people and for the people. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=586.98s)]
*  But really, he has a government for the rich and the powerful. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=592.42s)]
*  And that's what both of these pardons prove. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=596.18s)]
*  There's something else that strikes me, whether it's a pardon or parole, even one of the key elements has [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=598.42s)]
*  typically been for a very long time, remorse. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=604.62s)]
*  Right. You have to say I did something wrong and I'm sorry I did it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=607.9399999999999s)]
*  We don't see that here. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=611.62s)]
*  In fact, we see the exact opposite. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=613.26s)]
*  We see people who say that they are the victims, that the system is being weaponized to use against them. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=615.4599999999999s)]
*  Speak to that change and if you will, Anthony, what the consequences are for our justice system. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=621.66s)]
*  You're exactly right. Typically, when we see pardons, it is because there has been some type of miscarriage of [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=629.1s)]
*  justice. Right. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=634.46s)]
*  Typically, people admit guilt. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=635.5400000000001s)]
*  We don't have that here. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=637.98s)]
*  We literally have with Walsack somebody who pleaded guilty voluntarily to a crime. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=639.22s)]
*  And so the takeaway from his is that you have a two tiered system of justice where you have government for the rich and the powerful for people who have access to money, but not for everyone else. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=644.46s)]
*  And I mean, it's really a sad state of affairs. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=657.74s)]
*  But honestly, Chris, I think it is it is a prelude of what is to come with Donald Trump. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=661.94s)]
*  I mean, Ryan Reilly has reported, among others, in the DOJ press press corps about the decimation of the public integrity section within the criminal division of the Justice Department. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=668.38s)]
*  Two of those attorneys prosecuted Walsack. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=678.62s)]
*  When I was there, there were more than 30 lawyers within the career staff of the public integrity section. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=681.3s)]
*  Now, according to The Washington Post, there are less than five. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=688.5s)]
*  And then there are reports that a key policy that requires U.S. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=693.26s)]
*  attorneys across the country to check and many times get approval from the career staff before approving public corruption cases that they won't even be able to do that if this policy change comes through. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=698.42s)]
*  So it's a sad state of affairs in our nation's justice system. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5P2Zf4oEmk&t=711.3s)]
