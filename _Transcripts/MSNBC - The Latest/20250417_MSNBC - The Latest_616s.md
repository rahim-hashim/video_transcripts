# Powell's mistake was 'stating the obvious': Trump blasts Fed chair's comments on tariffs
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA)
*  What does the president mean exactly when he writes his termination can't come soon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=0.0s)]
*  enough talking about the Fed chair? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=5.92s)]
*  It's a tough question to answer, honestly. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=8.16s)]
*  Ana, I think what we see here is someone who has been a foil for President Trump almost [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=10.72s)]
*  since the president appointed him during his first term. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=15.16s)]
*  The president Trump has regularly speculated about firing Jerome Powell. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=18.0s)]
*  He's complained about his unwillingness in the president's view to lower interest rates [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=22.12s)]
*  fast enough. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=26.44s)]
*  And there you see in that Truth Social post kind of a passive voice speculation about [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=27.48s)]
*  firing Powell. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=31.8s)]
*  Now, it's been sort of understood that it's not possible to fire the Fed chair before [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=32.8s)]
*  the end of this term, which this in this particular case comes up in 2026. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=38.14s)]
*  Up until now, if there's anyone who could within the executive branch, it would be the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=43.3s)]
*  president, which makes his formulation of that post all the more curious. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Normally, you would say that this is a position that cannot be fired within the federal government. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=51.68s)]
*  That certainly Powell's view of his position. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=56.36s)]
*  But the president has already fired several other nominally independent regulators across [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=63.48s)]
*  And the Supreme Court is looking into that question even as we speak. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=64.64s)]
*  So again, sort of a veiled threat of some kind from the president, but not a lot of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=68.56s)]
*  specificity there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=73.56s)]
*  Brian, tell us more, though, about the comments we heard from the Fed chair that has apparently [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=75.12s)]
*  really set the president off. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=80.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=81.88s)]
*  He's saying that the tariff policies are going to throw the United States economy into definitely [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=82.88s)]
*  more uncertainty that at least they had planned for. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=87.6s)]
*  So the Federal Reserve chairman telling the Economic Club of Chicago yesterday that the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=89.96s)]
*  tariffs were larger than they had expected. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=93.84s)]
*  And for that reason, they expect the U.S. economy to grow slower and for price pressures [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=96.0s)]
*  and for inflation to go higher as a result of these policies. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=99.74s)]
*  Take a listen to the Fed chair yesterday. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=102.8s)]
*  Our obligation is to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=105.94s)]
*  that a one time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=111.48s)]
*  We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual mandate goals are in tension. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal and the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=122.48s)]
*  potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=127.4s)]
*  to close. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=132.4s)]
*  I want to point out that that challenging scenario is one that the Federal Reserve [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=133.4s)]
*  has been in before during Trump's first term during the trade war with China as well, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=137.8s)]
*  where it was actually the ratcheting up of the tariff conversation that led the Federal [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  Reserve to lower interest rates with the economic uncertainty. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  Financial markets also rolling at the time. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=149.16000000000003s)]
*  So maybe the similar playbook here, although I want to point out the Fed has been very [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=151.12s)]
*  adamant they do not make interest rate moves based off of politics. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=154.84s)]
*  But if the economy and the financial markets do react negatively, maybe that puts the Fed [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=158.84s)]
*  in an uncomfortable position to act. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  He quoted Ferris Bueller, actually the Fed chair yesterday, saying life moves pretty [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=164.88s)]
*  fast, clearly tariff policy as well. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=168.96s)]
*  Well, and this is a Fed chair, Jeff, who has shown independence, even though he was appointed [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=171.0s)]
*  by President Trump, actually in his first term. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  Now he's repeatedly taken on some heat from the president who's called for his resignation [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=178.72s)]
*  multiple times. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=184.28s)]
*  The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said it's not permitted under law for him to be fired. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=185.28s)]
*  So what do you make of this growing tension between these two? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=190.7s)]
*  Couple things. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  Number one, President Trump, as you rightly say, appointed Fed chair Powell during his [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  first term, passing over at the time Janet Yellen, who was the Fed chair and then ended [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  up becoming President Biden's Treasury secretary. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=203.52s)]
*  President Biden reappointed him, and that may give President Trump another opportunity [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=206.44s)]
*  to blame Biden, which is something that he likes to do. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=211.3s)]
*  In general, I would say my analysis is President Trump likes to have a foil, whether that is [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=213.68s)]
*  the Fed chair, whether that is the media, whether that is his predecessor. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=218.12s)]
*  That's something that he likes very much. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=222.0s)]
*  He needs to have something or someone to blame. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=223.72s)]
*  And right now he's got a lot of problems. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=226.42s)]
*  And so he's looking for people to point the finger at. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=228.04s)]
*  As we've mentioned, Jason, we have seen this president get rid of IGs, FBI directors, people [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=229.96s)]
*  who traditionally would seem off limits. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=236.64s)]
*  And so normally we would say he couldn't fire someone from an independent agency full stop. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=240.78s)]
*  But that question is currently before the Supreme Court right now with a ruling expected [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=246.36s)]
*  at any time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=250.32s)]
*  What is your reaction, Jason, to the president's threat to now terminate Powell? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=251.64s)]
*  Should we take it seriously? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=256.24s)]
*  I think we absolutely should take it seriously. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=259.24s)]
*  First of all, let's understand what Powell did wrong. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=261.36s)]
*  He stated the obvious. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=263.8s)]
*  He said something that every economist is saying, which is these tariffs are going to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=265.38s)]
*  cause higher inflation and higher unemployment. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=269.52s)]
*  In his first term, there were two big constraints on firing Powell. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=273.76s)]
*  The first was the fear of what the market reaction would be. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=278.16s)]
*  The second was the constraint from the Supreme Court. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=282.12s)]
*  Well, the president has shown that he cares much less about markets than he did in his [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  first term. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't know how much of a restraint that will be on him. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  And the court is anyone's guess what they will decide in these other cases and the implications [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=294.92s)]
*  that would have for the president wielding unlimited power over the executive branch, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  including the Federal Reserve. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=307.84s)]
*  You do have to wonder how long the president can just sort of brush off what we're seeing [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=309.2s)]
*  on Wall Street right now. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  Obviously, Wall Street was rattled by those comments from Jerome Powell yesterday. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=315.23999999999995s)]
*  We saw the Dow close down 700 points, and right now it's on target to have another negative [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=319.46s)]
*  day. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=324.84s)]
*  Right now, again, Jason, this appears to be reaction to the potential downturn of the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=326.08s)]
*  economy. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=334.0s)]
*  Do you agree with Powell's assessment of the tariff impact in the state of the economy? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=335.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=338.96s)]
*  I don't know an economist that doesn't think that we're going to get higher inflation and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=339.96s)]
*  lower growth because of these tariffs. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=345.04s)]
*  The debate is whether the growth is going to be like 0.03, so you don't have a recession, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=347.44s)]
*  or minus something, which would be a recession. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=352.32s)]
*  But you're just debating shades of badness. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=357.24s)]
*  And for the Fed, this is particularly difficult. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=360.2s)]
*  When the inflation rate rises, they like to raise interest rates to cool the economy [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=362.52s)]
*  down. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=366.2s)]
*  When the unemployment rate rises, they like to cut interest rates to help fix the economy. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=367.2s)]
*  They can't do both of those, and so they don't have a good answer. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=373.24s)]
*  The only good answer to the economic quandary we're in isn't the Fed solving a problem it [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=377.4s)]
*  can't solve. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=381.96s)]
*  It would be the president dropping his insistence on these huge destabilizing, harmful tariffs. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=383.12s)]
*  So let's talk to Garrett about that piece, because the president continues to meet with [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=389.4s)]
*  foreign leaders for tariff negotiations. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  Yesterday it was Japan. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=395.79999999999995s)]
*  Today it's Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Maloney. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=397.12s)]
*  Garrett, what should we expect from this meeting today? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=400.0s)]
*  Well, the Italian prime minister represents a far-right party in Italy. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=402.96s)]
*  She's sort of culturally aligned with President Trump, seemed to be one of the most conservative [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=407.52s)]
*  leaders in Western Europe. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=411.79999999999995s)]
*  So there should be some positive vibes from this meeting, but Italy also has a significant [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=413.68s)]
*  trade surplus with the United States, the U.S. in trade debt to Italy, which is not [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=419.52s)]
*  something the president would like, nor really like the fact that Italy is a laggard when [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=425.64s)]
*  it comes to defense spending. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=429.40000000000003s)]
*  They're short of the NATO goal of 2 percent of their GDP. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=431.32s)]
*  So some thorny issues to hash out with a leader who might otherwise be seen as something of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  a bridge between this president and the European Union. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=440.36s)]
*  We will watch this all play out as we've gotten used to seeing in an Oval Office meeting [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=443.48s)]
*  that you are expected to have around one o'clock today, Anna. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=448.0s)]
*  Jeff? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=450.88s)]
*  In a previous life, I covered the European Union in Brussels, and I think it's important [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=451.88s)]
*  to note that the EU negotiates as a bloc on trade. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  So Maloney coming today is not just representing her country, Italy. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=460.24s)]
*  She's representing 27 nations. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=464.32s)]
*  And she's been called Europe's Trump whisperer. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=466.32s)]
*  Ding, ding, ding. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=469.12s)]
*  There's a reason why she's coming and not the European Commission president, Ursula [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=470.32s)]
*  von der Leyen, who is not necessarily seen in Trump world as an interlocutor that they [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=474.24s)]
*  want to deal with. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=480.52s)]
*  So it was pretty strategic of the EU to send the Italian prime minister. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=481.68s)]
*  I also wonder how much of the optics is sort of giving the president what he wants to begin [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=485.48s)]
*  with, that he can then claim some kind of victory just by having the show of all these [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=491.24s)]
*  leaders coming to him and wanting to meet with him directly. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=497.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, he even tweeted about that this morning or put out a social media post. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=499.53999999999996s)]
*  Do you think that that is the goal in some ways? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=503.21999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I think it's a big part of the goal. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=506.06s)]
*  The optics matter a lot to this White House and to this president. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=507.85999999999996s)]
*  He wants to see and he wants to show that leaders are coming, that leaders are calling, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=510.7s)]
*  that leaders want to make a deal. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=515.42s)]
*  He likes very much to be the dealmaker in chief. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=517.26s)]
*  And if he shows the world, if he shows his constituents that others are coming and I [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=519.42s)]
*  don't want to say bending the knee, but at least coming and doing what he wants, that's [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=524.06s)]
*  a win for President Trump. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=528.3s)]
*  The president, Brian, has said that these tariffs would be bringing in two billion dollars [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=529.66s)]
*  a day of revenue to the U.S. government. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=533.78s)]
*  But then there was some new data that just came out that really suggests that's not happening. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=536.18s)]
*  What are the facts? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=540.54s)]
*  Yeah, and that's coming from his own CBP and a statement to CNBC saying that the real figure [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=541.54s)]
*  is actually somewhere closer to five hundred million dollars. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=546.5799999999999s)]
*  That's well short of what the president has said of two billion dollars per day. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=549.06s)]
*  But I think what's even more important than the actual number itself is the kind of [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=552.54s)]
*  rhetoric around who's actually paying it, because I want to point out that when it comes to [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=557.74s)]
*  these import fees, really, it's an American importing company that in many cases is the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=561.3399999999999s)]
*  one that has to fill out the forms to say, hey, here's the tariff that we need to pay. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=565.78s)]
*  And then they pay CBP that fee. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=570.0999999999999s)]
*  So it's not the CCP or the European Union that's paying those fees. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=571.9399999999999s)]
*  It's American companies that are bringing those goods into the United States that are [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=576.3399999999999s)]
*  now facing that higher levy. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=579.86s)]
*  And this all kind of puts into this conversation what we need to remember, which is that ultimately [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=581.6999999999999s)]
*  these costs could get passed down to consumers. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=586.2199999999999s)]
*  It's not the governments that really pay them. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=588.54s)]
*  It is the American buyer that is going to face those price increases when those companies [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=590.74s)]
*  pass it on to them. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0io6z2HdoA&t=595.42s)]
