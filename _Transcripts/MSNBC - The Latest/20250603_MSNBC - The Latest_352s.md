# 'No question' Medicaid cuts will 'negatively affect healthcare': Rural health care leader
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM)
*  A recent report concludes that 742 rural hospitals are at risk of closing, with more [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=0.0s)]
*  than 300 of them classified as being at immediate risk, and proposed Medicaid cuts could push [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=6.88s)]
*  them over the edge. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Local papers report that for rural areas in the South and Midwest, on the East and West [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=14.94s)]
*  Coast, Medicaid cuts pose an existential threat, bringing bipartisan warnings. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=19.38s)]
*  Millions of millions of Americans will have their health insurance rise dramatically because [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=26.2s)]
*  of the cuts. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=30.56s)]
*  If we lose $3 billion for hospitals, I can't say we're going to be able to keep all of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=31.56s)]
*  my hospitals open. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=36.32s)]
*  I'm worried about that, and we've seen a lot of them close in my state. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=37.32s)]
*  I'll be honest with you, we are already as it is, we are struggling with rural health [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=39.72s)]
*  care coverage. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  And Colorado Public Radio reports that an entire cluster of rural counties there, with [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=45.46s)]
*  about 50,000 people, could face a total shutdown of health care if Medicaid is slashed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=50.12s)]
*  That's where we find our next guest, Connie Martin, CEO of San Luis Valley Health. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=57.12s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us, Connie, and I know you provide health care to six [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=61.959999999999994s)]
*  rural Colorado counties. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=66.52s)]
*  What would the proposed cuts mean for you and for your patients? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  There's just no question that it would negatively affect health care in our region. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=73.52s)]
*  We serve about 50,000 patients in rural Colorado, and almost 40% of those have Medicaid. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=77.4s)]
*  And with the loss of that, there would be no revenue to help take care of those patients. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  And when they lose coverage, they don't lose the need for health care. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=92.36000000000001s)]
*  And so those patients would wait until later in their disease process, wait until later [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  in their illness. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=103.12s)]
*  They would show up at our emergency room. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  It would be a crisis on our health care system. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  And we just, as a rural hospital, would not have the resources to take care of them. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=110.56s)]
*  So it would be devastating to our rural health care system and likely to many, many of our [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=115.68s)]
*  peers as well. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=121.28s)]
*  Medicare and Medicaid Service Administrator Dr. Mehmet Az says that any deserving, that's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=123.64s)]
*  his word, deserving Medicaid recipients will be shielded under this plan. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=128.36s)]
*  As someone who would be impacted, your 50,000 people would be impacted. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=133.7s)]
*  Have you gotten any indication of what the criteria is to be, as he put it, deserving [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=140.32s)]
*  of coverage? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=146.74s)]
*  Can you even define that? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=147.74s)]
*  No, I can't. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=149.3s)]
*  You know, the details in the bill so far have been hard to understand, and I think it's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=151.3s)]
*  really early in that process. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=156.9s)]
*  I will tell you that in Colorado, just in the past year or so after the pandemic, there [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=159.06s)]
*  have been 575,000 people that have lost their Medicaid coverage. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=164.18s)]
*  And that's in what we've defined, what we call in Colorado the unwind. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=169.82000000000002s)]
*  And with that, we've seen over a 40% rise in emergency department coverage. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=174.82000000000002s)]
*  And I know in our valley, in our region in southern Colorado, many deserving and qualified [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=181.36s)]
*  recipients lost their Medicaid coverage through administrative issues and through problems [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=188.62s)]
*  with the Medicaid eligibility system. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=194.74s)]
*  And so there are a lot of challenges with Medicaid that have nothing to do with the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=197.06s)]
*  eligibility of the patient. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  The process to qualify for Medicaid is extremely complicated. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  And so I don't know what that word deserving means, but I think that the system is very, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=209.06s)]
*  very critical and important for patients and for rural hospitals. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  It's essential for their survival. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=221.54s)]
*  Let me ask you, we only have a minute left though about the broader picture. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=223.74s)]
*  The health care system is the biggest employer in San Luis. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=226.74s)]
*  That is not unique. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=230.1s)]
*  In 2023, U.S. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=231.5s)]
*  hospitals directly employed 6.6 million people and supported nearly one in six jobs across [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  the country. They purchased more than one point three trillion dollars directly in goods [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=239.7s)]
*  and services. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=244.86s)]
*  So beyond health care, what would the loss of hospitals mean to your area? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=246.26000000000002s)]
*  There's no question it would have a devastating impact on our entire region's economy. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=251.34s)]
*  We're the only hospital in our region that delivers babies that provide surgery. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=257.02s)]
*  It's 120 miles to the next facility that provides comparable care. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=262.06s)]
*  It would it would devastate our entire region's economy, not only because of the 700 jobs [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=267.06s)]
*  that we have, but because families couldn't live there. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=272.5s)]
*  You couldn't count on having services. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=275.38s)]
*  We have a national park in our region. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=278.3s)]
*  We get nearly 700,000 visitors a year. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=281.02s)]
*  Think of the number of tourists and visitors who count on our health care system being [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=284.62s)]
*  there when they just visit. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=289.14s)]
*  You know, not only do Medicaid patients lose when a rural hospital closes, but the entire [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=290.42s)]
*  community loses, the entire region loses. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=296.9s)]
*  So, you know, when we count on Medicaid for a third of our revenue, but when a third of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=299.74s)]
*  our revenue goes away, health care could go away for all 50,000 residents. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=306.26s)]
*  And that's true of every rural community in the country. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=310.9s)]
*  And there are many, many rural hospitals that are even much more vulnerable than mine. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=314.53999999999996s)]
*  And they could be impacted much quicker. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=319.02s)]
*  And the trajectory to close rural hospitals could be very quick in a major Medicaid revenue [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=322.02s)]
*  decline. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=327.3s)]
*  That is a sobering and incredibly important message. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=328.34000000000003s)]
*  Connie Martin, thank you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMUakgUjrM&t=330.94s)]
