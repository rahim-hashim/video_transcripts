# ‘Dramatic ambush’: Trump attempts to humiliate South African president with ‘white genocide’ claims
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A)
*  Another day for the history books today from Donald J. Trump, an astonishing display from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=0.0s)]
*  him in the White House. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=6.26s)]
*  Today, Donald Trump meeting with the president of South Africa and attempting to ambush and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=7.88s)]
*  humiliate that leader inside the Oval Office. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=13.68s)]
*  But what he did instead was embarrass and humiliate the people of the United States [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=17.52s)]
*  of America. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=21.78s)]
*  Again, in his meeting with President Ramaphosa, Trump peddled unsubstantiated claims of genocide [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=22.78s)]
*  in South Africa of white South Africans, a group that ruled during apartheid in South [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=29.52s)]
*  Africa. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=35.32s)]
*  It is a fringe conspiracy theory pushed by the likes of Elon Musk, Tucker Carlson and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=36.32s)]
*  David Duke, the former grand wizard of the KKK. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=42.2s)]
*  We take from many, many locations if we feel there's persecution or genocide going on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=47.2s)]
*  And we had a lot of people. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  I must tell you, Mr. President, we have had a tremendous number of people, especially [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=57.2s)]
*  since they've seen this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  Generally, they're white farmers and they're fleeing South Africa. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  And it's a very sad thing to see. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=68.56s)]
*  But I hope we can have an explanation of that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=71.28s)]
*  It'll be the end of the country if it's not. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=74.60000000000001s)]
*  So next, Trump asked his staff to dim the lights and roll in a television. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=79.56s)]
*  Since the lights were dimmed and the television was there, they played a video that Trump [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=85.64s)]
*  claimed showed evidence of genocide against white farmers. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=90.08s)]
*  Here's the reality as reported by The New York Times, quote, There have been killings [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=94.24s)]
*  of white South Africans, but police statistics show they are not killed at a higher rate [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=98.72s)]
*  than other South Africans. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=103.28s)]
*  And while the South African government did pass a law permitting the government to take [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=105.2s)]
*  land without compensation, the process is subject to judicial review. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=109.02s)]
*  President Ramaphosa did his part to fact check Donald Trump in real time. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=114.84s)]
*  He added that he didn't even recognize some of the locations in the video. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=119.36s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=123.0s)]
*  Our government policy is completely, completely against what he was saying, even in the parliament. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=126.12s)]
*  And they're a small minority party, which is allowed to exist in terms of our constitution. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=136.28s)]
*  But when you do allow them to take land. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=142.76s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=145.76s)]
*  You do allow them to take land. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=146.76s)]
*  Nobody can take land. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=147.76s)]
*  And then when they take the land, they kill the white farmer. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=148.76s)]
*  And when they kill the white farmer, nothing happens to them. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=152.28s)]
*  No, there is quite... [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=155.48s)]
*  Nothing happens to them. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=157.32s)]
*  There is criminality in our country. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=158.32s)]
*  People who do get killed, unfortunately, through criminal activity, are not only white people. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=161.44s)]
*  After all that, the leader of South Africa, South Africa's president, tried to lighten [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=172.76s)]
*  the mood a little bit. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=178.2s)]
*  Trump suggested that all of this tension between them could have been avoided as South Africa [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=180.24s)]
*  had just bought him an airplane. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=185.44s)]
*  I'm sorry, I don't have a plane to give you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=188.68s)]
*  I wish you didn't. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=191.12s)]
*  I take it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=192.12s)]
*  I would take it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=193.12s)]
*  But if your country offered the United States Air Force a plane, I would take it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=194.12s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=198.4s)]
*  Well, there you have it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=200.36s)]
*  Conspiracy theory peddling leader of the United States of America sitting inside a gilded [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=205.8s)]
*  Oval Office, again tarnishing America's image around the world. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=212.84s)]
*  This is where we start today with some of our favorite reporters and friends. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=218.52s)]
*  New York Times diplomatic correspondent Michael Crowley joins us. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  Also joining us, Princeton University professor, MSNBC contributor Eddie Glodzier. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=225.16000000000003s)]
*  With me at the table, former Under Secretary of State during the Obama administration and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=230.72s)]
*  author of Mandela's Way, Lessons on Life, Love and Courage, Rick Stengels here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  We need some life, love and courage to get through this today. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=240.28s)]
*  You watched the whole thing. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  Give me your analysis. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=245.52s)]
*  I mean, it was an astonishing display. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=246.52s)]
*  It's kind of a circus that he has now with these sprays. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=249.26000000000002s)]
*  And instead of actually going in and talking to the world leader, he kind of puts them [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=253.32s)]
*  on display. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=257.08s)]
*  For him? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=258.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=259.4s)]
*  I guess for his own audience. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=260.4s)]
*  I think part of what I find amazing too is that he has no impulse control. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  So he just keeps taking questions instead of saying, OK, we'll take some questions after [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=266.32s)]
*  we talk. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=270.68s)]
*  But I think his attempt to humiliate Cyril Ramaphosa wasn't successful. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=271.68s)]
*  I thought President Ramaphosa conducted himself with great poise. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=276.48s)]
*  He was good-humored about it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  He didn't insist on rebutting those charges, even though, for the most part, Trump's lies [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=282.72s)]
*  and exaggerations were extreme. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=288.72s)]
*  There are about 100,000 Afrikaner farmers in South Africa. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=290.8s)]
*  By the way, they are in no way responsible for apartheid, which their predecessors created. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=294.88000000000005s)]
*  But they do own a majority of the farmland. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=302.48s)]
*  And I would argue that so much of this crime is not black on white crime, but poverty on [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=304.92s)]
*  wealth crime. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=310.36s)]
*  I mean, I know you didn't see this in the stories. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=312.52s)]
*  We were chatting about it before. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=314.12s)]
*  Cyril brought a couple of folks along with him, Johann Rupert, the industrialist who [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=316.04s)]
*  knows Trump's back since the 70s, Ernie Ailes, the golfer, and John Steenhausen, who is the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=321.6s)]
*  Afrikaans agriculture minister in his government, all of whom said, this is crime. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=327.52s)]
*  South Africa has a terrible crime problem. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=333.36s)]
*  Mr. President, we'd like help with our crime problem. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=335.76s)]
*  It isn't just focused on this small group of Afrikaner farmers. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=338.9s)]
*  And I thought they made that point. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=342.53999999999996s)]
*  Not everybody's going to see that. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=345.26s)]
*  They're going to see the fireworks. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=346.26s)]
*  But I thought it lowered the temperature in the room in a way that hopefully would make [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=347.82s)]
*  some kind of dialogue useful. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=353.53999999999996s)]
*  For what? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=358.06s)]
*  Well, I mean, to take down the temperature. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=359.06s)]
*  So, for example, one of the things that's tragic about this is that the U.S. cut off [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=360.98s)]
*  about $400 million in AIDS funding to South Africa. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=365.34s)]
*  That's huge. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=369.9s)]
*  That's PEPFAR money that has saved the lives of millions of people in southern Africa. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=370.9s)]
*  They don't have that in their budget where that money comes from. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=376.09999999999997s)]
*  They have to raise taxes. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=378.78s)]
*  Those are children dying, families dying, mothers dying. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=380.34s)]
*  So part of the reason that I think Cyril Ramaphosa came here is to say, look, we do need your [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=384.9s)]
*  help. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=389.65999999999997s)]
*  By the way, it's true, as Secretary Rubio said, South Africa has been on the opposite [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=391.06s)]
*  side of so many issues in the U.N. between the U.S. and other nations. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=396.26000000000005s)]
*  They're always aligned with the non-aligned groups. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=401.54s)]
*  Even Nelson Mandela was on the other side of the U.S. on a lot of these issues. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  But that's not a reason to stop talking. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  And I think South Africa wants to kind of repair the breach. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=412.06s)]
*  Michael Crowley, if you're a foreign leader or working in the Foreign Service for a foreign [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=416.34s)]
*  leader and you watch the information that Trump peddled inside the Oval Office and the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=424.97999999999996s)]
*  quality of the content on the TV screen, what do you believe about the American foreign [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=431.41999999999996s)]
*  policy apparatus? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=438.05999999999995s)]
*  Well, it's off the rails, Nicole. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=440.06s)]
*  And the one thing you can say, I suppose, is that by this point maybe the world is getting [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=445.06s)]
*  used to, I would say, discounting things that the President of the United States says. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=454.06s)]
*  So at some point I think you reach a kind of there he goes again situation. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=460.06s)]
*  Not to diminish how astonishing this spectacle was, but now it's sort of becoming part of the Trump [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=467.06s)]
*  show. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=475.06s)]
*  It was like when that tirade against Ukrainian President Zelensky happened in February, we all [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=477.06s)]
*  thought, how can this be possible? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=483.06s)]
*  We've never seen anything like this. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=485.06s)]
*  And now we're seeing it again. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=487.06s)]
*  It's becoming the new norm, which is not to normalize it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=489.06s)]
*  But I also think, Nicole, at some point you have to wonder when foreign leaders are going to try [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=493.06s)]
*  to avoid being put in that position. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=501.06s)]
*  I spoke to a foreign policy professional who is in constant touch with foreign diplomats who said [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=504.06s)]
*  he was aware of some foreign leaders who actually are hoping to avoid invitations to the White [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=511.06s)]
*  House because they don't want to sit there in the Oval Office with President Trump and just have [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=517.06s)]
*  these, you know, to get berated or to have some kind of a circus breakout. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=521.06s)]
*  And it just makes diplomacy extremely dysfunctional when the President is so volatile, so unpredictable. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=525.06s)]
*  And as you point out, relying on, you know, debunked misleading or false information in the way he [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=533.06s)]
*  forms his opinions, it's going to make foreign leaders want to keep him at an arms distance. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=541.06s)]
*  Michael Crowley, what happens if the flow of good information to the United States of America [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=548.06s)]
*  breaks down and stops? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=556.06s)]
*  Well, it's a hard thing to wrap your head around, isn't it, Nicole? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=561.06s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's a big problem. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=564.06s)]
*  And there are sort of two different categories of this happening right now. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=567.06s)]
*  I think one is that the President is fed false information and conspiracy theories by people, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=572.06s)]
*  many of whom my senses are sort of in his more casual or social orbit. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=579.06s)]
*  Maybe he, you know, somebody hands him a printout at Mar-a-Lago, some golf buddy or someone who's a [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=584.06s)]
*  member at the club, that kind of a thing. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=590.06s)]
*  And, you know, that can be anything. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=592.06s)]
*  And that can be some pretty wild stuff. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=595.06s)]
*  The other category, which is also very serious, is what's happening in the intelligence community [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=599.06s)]
*  right now in the more formal process of information that's given to the President that has the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=603.06s)]
*  imprimatur of the IC, as we call it, the intelligence community, the U.S. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=608.06s)]
*  government. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=613.06s)]
*  And, you know, there are signs that the product that he's getting, including in a story that the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=614.06s)]
*  Times reported yesterday, suggesting that Tulsi Gabbard's chief of staff was trying to influence [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=618.06s)]
*  an intelligence report having to do with the Venezuelan gangs in the United States, possibly [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=625.06s)]
*  for political reasons. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=630.06s)]
*  You know, that flow of information now may be getting influenced and corrupted. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=632.06s)]
*  And, you know, what are the implications? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=637.06s)]
*  I mean, Nicole, where do I start? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=639.06s)]
*  It's just, it's very disturbing. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=641.06s)]
*  And obviously it's going to make for bad decision making and bad things for the United States if [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=645.06s)]
*  the President is acting on false or warped information. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=650.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7QcKIyE9A&t=655.06s)]
