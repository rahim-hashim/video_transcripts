# ‘Mother of all tax increases’: Fmr. GOP Congressman on Trump’s so-called trade deal with U.K.
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms)
*  have with us, former Republican Congressman Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania. He's the executive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=0.0s)]
*  director of the Aspen Institute Congressional Program and MSNBC political analyst Kimberly [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=4.96s)]
*  Atkins-Stor. She is a Boston Globe columnist and co-host of the hashtag Sisters in Law podcast. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=9.92s)]
*  So here we are, a whole new frontier with trade, you know, being at the center of the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Trump administration thinking that they've actually fixed the problem by opening the gates [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=23.52s)]
*  with the UK. Charlie, what's your sense of what this arrangement is with the UK [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=29.68s)]
*  and the impact it has on American consumers and workers? Because I gave you the American [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  Automotive Policy Council statement saying under this deal it will now be cheaper to import a UK [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=43.92s)]
*  vehicle with very little U.S. content than a USMCA compliant vehicle from Mexico or Canada [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  that is half American parts. This hurts American automakers, suppliers, and auto workers. So [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=57.12s)]
*  not a good deal? Well, the United States and the UK should enter into a trade agreement, but not any [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  trade agreement. I've been saying this for years. Ever since the British breg-sited, they need [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=69.84s)]
*  trade agreements desperately, and frankly so does President Trump given this really absurd trade war. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=74.96s)]
*  But they're rushing this, and so the devil will be in the details as they say, but we don't know if [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=82.0s)]
*  this is a good deal or a bad deal today. But you know the preliminary details. We don't know if it is a deal today. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=87.84s)]
*  We don't even know. Look, to write a trade deal, it takes a lot of time. You know, President Biden [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=92.08s)]
*  didn't do any trade deals. Trump did one. He did an update of NAFTA, USMCA, and they're out of practice. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=98.64s)]
*  But my experience is, and we've done South Korea, Panama, CAFTA, Oman, you know, all of them that I [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=104.48s)]
*  was involved with, it took time. I mean, these just cannot be forced and rushed. So this is a concept, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=110.24s)]
*  but there's going to be a lot of commentary on it. It's a long way before it gets ratified, I think. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  You know, I think people talk about this all the time, but that the president does things to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=120.32s)]
*  distract. I don't think this was a distraction today. I think that he truly, he needed to win. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=126.88s)]
*  He has over-promised on these tariffs and under-delivered for weeks at this point, you know, his [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=133.04s)]
*  the treasury secretary and Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, have been saying, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=140.0s)]
*  oh, there, we're talking to a lot of people. A lot of folks want to negotiate with us. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  We're coming to agreements. And what we saw today, the big pop and circumstance of this announcement, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=148.72s)]
*  if you will, of a deal, we're going to use quotes every time we talk about a deal, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=155.11999999999998s)]
*  I believe was to try to throw a little, throw a little something out there on the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=159.04s)]
*  ether, put something on the table, as Michael Steele would say, to quiet some of the critics. But [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  we're, we're, we're still going to be critical because this is not what they say it is. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=167.52s)]
*  It isn't. It's a shiny object is really, it's for some, someone, something out there for people to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=171.68s)]
*  look at and give them the opportunity to say, hey, we're doing something, but it's still like [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=176.72s)]
*  an arsonist saying, okay, well, I have a framework of a deal that's coming in a few weeks to get a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=181.68s)]
*  fire hose out to this house as it burns. It's a problem that he created with this trade war that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=187.12s)]
*  nobody asked for. And he's seeing the implications of it and he's trying to do something. But here's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=194.4s)]
*  the thing, everything even that he said, we're going to get a manufacturing again, just as you [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=200.72s)]
*  said, talk to automakers who he clearly doesn't have an understand about how cars and other [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=205.68s)]
*  cross country goods are produced. How do we build a car in America for heaven's sake? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=211.36s)]
*  And he's the one who negotiated USMCA. So the fact that he doesn't know that is, is really [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=216.64s)]
*  outrageous. The fact that he's saying, oh, well, they're going to take, we're going to make a [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  great deal for the UK to export American agriculture. How are you going to do that? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=226.24s)]
*  When first of all, the UK safety standards are so high that with the gutting of the FDA and the USDA, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=230.96s)]
*  they may not take a lot of this agricultural products. How are you going to produce this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=236.8s)]
*  agriculture without immigrants who work in this field? And there are already trade groups saying [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=241.36s)]
*  that they're going to be hit terribly by the immigration policy. It's a lot of smoke and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=246.56s)]
*  mirrors, but there does not seem to be much there. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=250.96s)]
*  But it's also to your point, a lot of connected parts. And that is what he is not understanding. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=253.44s)]
*  He's also understanding, I think there are the poll numbers that show that Americans are unhappy [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  with how they perceive these tariffs to be impacting the economy. There's also the fact [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=262.24s)]
*  that our allies are beginning to consider what the global trade order is going to look like without [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=266.32s)]
*  us. So there was reporting in the New York Times about how the EU is developing a backup plan. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=272.16s)]
*  The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union announced two new steps [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=277.52s)]
*  that it would take to hit back at America if trade negotiations fail. Officials laid out $107 billion [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=281.68s)]
*  worth of goods that they could target with higher tariffs in retaliation to the duties that the US [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=288.0s)]
*  has announced or imposed. Here's the other part. They also said that the block would start a [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=293.12s)]
*  world trade organization dispute against the United States on Trump's across the board tariffs, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=297.6s)]
*  as well as duties levied on cars and car parts. There is restructuring global trade. There is then [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=303.12s)]
*  restructuring the global order. And what about the champagne? The EU, the champagne? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=310.32s)]
*  Those are geographic identifiers. That is of particular interest to my co-host. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=315.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's champagne, it's Bologna, it's Gouda. I get it. But the problem we've got right [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=320.0s)]
*  now is Trump's level of tariffs are just so ridiculously high. And even with this UK [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=326.48s)]
*  agreement, whatever it is, he still maintains a 10% across the board. And the American people [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=332.24s)]
*  are reacting against these tariffs because this is a massive tax increase by any measure. Any [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=338.08s)]
*  Republican who is against taxes, this is the mother of all tax increases. And that's why people are [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=343.2s)]
*  upset with it. This trade proposal is part of his disengagement policy, shutting down USAID, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=348.56s)]
*  getting rid of soft power, retreating from our allies, trade war. This is all an inward looking [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=357.04s)]
*  country. And frankly, it'll make us less prosperous, it'll make us poorer. And so this deal, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  I hope they get something together, but it doesn't sound like it's very comprehensive. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=369.04s)]
*  America first becomes America alone becomes America last. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=373.04s)]
*  Yeah. And that's okay with MAGA Republicans who have a backward view of the American economy. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=376.88s)]
*  They perceive any integration or relationship to be unequal. And so if you go into a relationship [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=386.88s)]
*  with that perspective, it's going to be very hard to reset it and get it to move, even if it is [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=397.6s)]
*  slightly out of balance, to fix it. There is, as you know, Congressman, there is an upside to having [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=403.52s)]
*  a trade imbalance with certain partners because of the way we consume their goods and our people [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  like it. And that's good. It's not out of line for that to happen. The problem that Donald Trump [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=416.72s)]
*  has goes to exactly what Commerce Secretary Lutnick said today. Let's listen to him about [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=422.64000000000004s)]
*  Trump's hopes for de-escalation with, shall I say the C word, China. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=428.48s)]
*  The president did say that he expects a quote, good weekend with China. What would be defined [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=435.68s)]
*  as good? Well, de-escalation. That's what the president hopes is a good outcome, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=440.56s)]
*  is a de-escalating world where we go back to trading with each other and then we work on a [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=446.4s)]
*  big deal together. Everybody's already started de-escalating with the United States. De-escalation [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=451.52s)]
*  is we're not going to be bothered with you. The Chinese are sitting there going, what are we going [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  to do? What are you bringing to the table for us? Because as you noted, the tariffs are still high [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=464.4s)]
*  across the board, 147%. So how does he de-escalate with China? Well, look, the Chinese have a higher [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=468.96s)]
*  threshold for pain than we do. They're an autocratic regime. I don't think President Xi sits up at [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=478.23999999999995s)]
*  night worrying about public opinion. This is hurting China, but you know what? They can take the pain [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=483.12s)]
*  easier than we can. And frankly, Trump 2.0 is not terribly different than Trump 1.0 when it came to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  the trade war. Remember what he did last time? He went after the Europeans. He went after Canada [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=495.12s)]
*  and Mexico on steel and aluminum. And they said, let's go after the Chinese. After sticking an eye, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=500.88s)]
*  a stick in the eye of our allies, he wants to go after China. He did the same thing this time. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=507.36s)]
*  He went after all of our friends in North America and in Europe and then says, oh, now let's go [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  after the Chinese together. This isn't working. It's incomprehensible to me. And by the way, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=516.0s)]
*  China has an ability to substitute out a lot of the things that we send them easier than we do. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=522.88s)]
*  Soybeans, agricultural product. And so it's going to be harder for us. And I think Trump [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=527.2s)]
*  has miscalculated here, and Xi is in no position right now to negotiate. He doesn't feel he has to. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=533.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6XwYvZ6Ms&t=552.88s)]
