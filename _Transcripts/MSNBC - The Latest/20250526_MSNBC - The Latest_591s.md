# ‘I don’t know what the hell happened to Putin’: Trump blasts Russia’s massive attack
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk)
*  NBC's Raf Sanchez is covering this story from London, also with us Peter Baker, chief White [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=0.0s)]
*  House correspondent for the New York Times and an MSNBC political analyst, and Joel Rubin [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=5.28s)]
*  was deputy assistant secretary of state under President Obama and is currently author of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=10.08s)]
*  the briefing book on Substack. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  Okay, Peter, how do you read the president's remarks today? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=16.8s)]
*  Well, look, obviously we know he hasn't changed. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=20.2s)]
*  This is exactly who Vladimir Putin is and has always been. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=24.28s)]
*  He's been sending rockets into civilian areas of Ukraine now for years. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=27.68s)]
*  What's happened is, of course, that Trump has discovered that Putin doesn't want peace. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=33.08s)]
*  Trump told voters time and time again last year he could make peace in Ukraine so easily. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=37.68s)]
*  It happened in 24 hours. In fact, he would do it even before he took office, before his [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  inauguration. Obviously, that hasn't happened. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=47.96s)]
*  So since Trump doesn't want to have to acknowledge that that was wrong, that he didn't have the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=50.08s)]
*  magical ability to stall this war with the snap of a finger, he has to explain it by [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=54.88s)]
*  saying, well, obviously Putin has changed. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=59.32000000000001s)]
*  He's gone crazy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=61.0s)]
*  You know, look, the fact that he's feeling frustrated at Putin is, in fact, a turning [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=62.88s)]
*  point. This has been something we're seeing in the last few weeks where he is expressing [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=67.0s)]
*  more exasperation with Putin, more of a recognition, it seems, that Russia is not sitting [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=70.38000000000001s)]
*  there waiting to make peace, that Russia, in fact, was the aggressor in this war to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=75.0s)]
*  begin with, something that the president hadn't acknowledged at first. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=79.06s)]
*  All of this does come, Rafa, a week after the president said Ukraine and Russia would, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=82.88s)]
*  quote, immediately start negotiations toward a ceasefire. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=87.36s)]
*  What's happened on the ground that might change that calculation or has it? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, what a difference a week makes, right? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=96.28s)]
*  Last Monday, President Trump spent two hours on the phone with Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  He said it was an excellent discussion and he came out of it saying that Ukraine and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=103.28s)]
*  Russia were going to move immediately towards direct negotiations on a ceasefire. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=108.28s)]
*  And a week on, none of that has happened. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=113.4s)]
*  Instead, we have seen Russia unleashing some of the largest aerial bombardments on [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=116.0s)]
*  Ukraine since the beginning of the war. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=121.28s)]
*  Over the weekend, according to Ukrainian officials, Russia firing some 700 missiles [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=123.84s)]
*  and drones at cities all across the country, including Kiev. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=129.8s)]
*  You look at some of the footage of Kiev and it really it looks like wartime London or [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=132.64s)]
*  something. You have searchlights scanning the skies for these incoming drones. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=136.52s)]
*  You can see those are civilian houses that are on fire there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=141.0s)]
*  The Ukrainian government says at least 18 people were killed in that bombardment, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=144.36s)]
*  including a number of children. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=148.84s)]
*  And we should say, Chris, that some of these ballistic missiles are coming from North [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=151.4s)]
*  Korea. Some of these drones are based on Iranian design and the Russians are firing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  them in much, much larger numbers now than they were before. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  And it is really not clear whether the Ukrainians are going to be able to keep up with this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=165.16s)]
*  level of intense aerial attacks going forward. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=171.6s)]
*  Now, the big, big question is whether President Trump's angry words yesterday are going to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=176.28s)]
*  be backed up with action actions. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=182.12s)]
*  We have heard President Zelensky pleading the United States to impose new sanctions on [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=184.28s)]
*  Russia. NATO allies in Europe are saying the same. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  So far, President Trump not committing to that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  Chris, thank you for that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=195.44s)]
*  So, Joel, assuming the president now believes that maybe Putin isn't the man he thought [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  he was, what does this mean for negotiations and what should it mean for U.S. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  strategy going forward? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=207.28s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, it's great to be with you and forgive me for for chuckling a bit. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=209.76s)]
*  It's as if Donald Trump finally got the memo. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=214.04s)]
*  My God, he just realized that Vladimir Putin is unjustifiably attacking Ukraine. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=216.72s)]
*  It's kind of preposterous. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=222.48s)]
*  I think the Vladimir Putin is playing Donald Trump for a fool and has him running in circles [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  when it comes to the negotiation track. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  And there's only one direct way to stop this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  And that is to get tough on Putin. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=233.92s)]
*  That is for the United States to realign ourselves with our allies in NATO to share [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=236.52s)]
*  intelligence in a way that is not threatened every other week. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=241.84s)]
*  If the president doesn't like what Vladimir Zelensky of Ukraine says to coordinate with [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=245.04s)]
*  the Ukrainian military and to offer up supply. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=250.56s)]
*  That's a key thing that Roth mentioned. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=253.68s)]
*  There needs to be clarity that we are going to continue to supply Ukraine's military [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=255.48s)]
*  indefinitely in order to put pressure back on Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=260.4s)]
*  I fear that that is a bit of the squeeze that Putin is hoping for with these heavy bombardments [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=264.92s)]
*  and drone attacks that maybe we'll just stop supplying Ukraine. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=269.76s)]
*  Then he'll get the advantage. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=273.32s)]
*  That all needs to make itself clear. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=274.68s)]
*  And that's how we get this realign and back onto a potential diplomatic path. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=277.08s)]
*  So Peter, let me play some more from exactly what the president had to say about what he [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=281.8s)]
*  thinks happens now. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=285.48s)]
*  You mentioned you're unhappy with President Putin. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=286.48s)]
*  You've talked before about putting more sanctions on Russia. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=287.48s)]
*  Is that something you're considering more true? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=288.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=289.48s)]
*  He's killing a lot of people. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=290.48s)]
*  I don't know what's wrong with him. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=291.48s)]
*  What the hell happened to him, right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=292.48s)]
*  He's killing a lot of people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=293.48s)]
*  I'm not happy about that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=294.48s)]
*  So you know Russia well. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=295.48s)]
*  You worked in Moscow for years. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  First, Putin killing people isn't new. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=300.56s)]
*  Do you think any of what the president is saying, even the threat of sanctions, will [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  in any way change Putin's strategy going forward? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=309.36s)]
*  What might be some of the things that he's going to do to stop Putin from doing that? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=312.44s)]
*  Well, in any way, change Putin's strategy going forward. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=319.36s)]
*  What might be something that would get this headed in a different direction? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=322.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you're right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  I've covered Putin now for 25 years. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  He hasn't changed. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=331.56s)]
*  This is exactly who he is. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=332.56s)]
*  He's always killed people. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=333.8s)]
*  You know, it used to be in small numbers, and now in the last three years, it's been [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=336.16s)]
*  increasingly in larger numbers. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=339.68s)]
*  And he sees that to the advantage of Russia. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  He will only make a deal if he sees it to the advantage of Russia. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  I think to Joel's point, Putin's calculation here is that the United States won't, in fact, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=348.88s)]
*  continue to ship arms to Ukraine. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  In fact, may even cut off intelligence help, which has been very critical to the Ukrainian [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=356.32s)]
*  defense force's ability to fend off their invaders. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=361.52s)]
*  He is gambling that Trump gets tired of this. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  He gets impatient with this. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=367.76s)]
*  And as he himself, Trump himself has said, walks away. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=368.88s)]
*  If he walks away, does that mean he walks away from peace talks or does he walk away [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=371.64s)]
*  from Ukraine altogether? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=374.84s)]
*  He always gambles. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=376.52s)]
*  He walks away from Ukraine altogether and that Russia then has the ability to make much [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=377.52s)]
*  more significant gains on the battlefield while Trump has decided he's not going to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=382.56s)]
*  be involved anymore. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=388.12s)]
*  I mean, these attacks, Joel, as you know, on Ukraine are devastating. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=389.12s)]
*  We saw the impact. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=393.52s)]
*  We heard about children being killed, but you don't gain territory with missile strikes. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  In fact, The Washington Post put it this way today. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=399.84s)]
*  Over the past year, Russia has taken only six tenths of one percent of additional Ukrainian [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=402.76s)]
*  territory at the cost of fifteen hundred killed or wounded per day. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=408.82s)]
*  That's according to current and former Western officials. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=414.46s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal says Trump told European leaders he thinks Putin is that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=417.59999999999997s)]
*  Putin thinks he's winning. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=422.28s)]
*  Is he? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=425.24s)]
*  It sure doesn't look like it on the ground, but what he is doing is terrorizing the Ukrainian [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=426.24s)]
*  people to your point in this data. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=432.28s)]
*  Look, you know, Vladimir Putin can't take Ukraine militarily at this moment. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=435.0s)]
*  But as we're discussing over time, if he gets the signals like he's been getting from President [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=441.08s)]
*  Trump and his team that we're not really backing Ukraine militarily, he may very well get there. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=445.79999999999995s)]
*  And so now he's puncturing, he's pushing, he's terrorizing Ukraine's civilians, trying [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=451.4s)]
*  to soften them up, trying to defeat their will. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=456.88s)]
*  Clearly they have strong will in Ukraine, and that's really what's made the difference [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=460.08s)]
*  in this war. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=464.8s)]
*  But you know, this is a period where maybe he can't get the ground, but he can certainly [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=465.97999999999996s)]
*  harm the Ukrainian people's feelings and sentiment. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=469.88s)]
*  And I think that's what we're witnessing right now. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  And Peter, we barely mentioned the third person in all this. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=476.36s)]
*  At the same time that Trump was admonishing Putin, the president also went after Volodymyr [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=479.36s)]
*  Zelensky, writing that everything out of his mouth causes trouble. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=483.28s)]
*  That of course came after Zelensky put out a message insisting that America's silence [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=488.24s)]
*  only encourages Putin. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=492.8s)]
*  Do you have a sense of, or what is the White House sense of the relationship between Trump [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=495.48s)]
*  and Zelensky right now? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=499.56s)]
*  Well, look, Trump doesn't like Zelensky. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=501.12s)]
*  Let's be honest about that. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=503.40000000000003s)]
*  That's always been the case. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=504.64s)]
*  He has a long time fixation on Ukraine that was fed by people around him that follows [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=506.12s)]
*  the train of thought that Russian propaganda has put out, which is that Ukraine was the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=511.82s)]
*  one that was interfering in the 2016 election against Trump, not Russia for Trump. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=515.04s)]
*  And basically this goes back now eight years. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  So in his mind, Ukraine is a corrupt country. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=523.92s)]
*  Ukraine in fact isn't really even a viable independent state. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=526.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump has long bought into the Russian line that Ukraine doesn't in fact have a history [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=530.1999999999999s)]
*  of independent identity, that in fact it is a vassalate, if you will, of Russia. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=534.66s)]
*  And so, yeah, he doesn't think very highly of Zelensky. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=540.86s)]
*  He has played Trump a little bit more cautiously in the last few weeks since that meltdown [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=544.36s)]
*  in the Oval Office along the lines that European allies have advised him, trying not to poke [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=549.7s)]
*  the bear too much, not to anger Trump too much. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=554.84s)]
*  But there's no love lost there by President Trump for President Zelensky. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=558.0s)]
*  So I think even as he's criticizing President Putin, which is a new thing really, he feels [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=561.48s)]
*  a need to sort of both sides it and make sure it also say President Zelensky is at fault. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLRdZ63zvVk&t=567.08s)]
