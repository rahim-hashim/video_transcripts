# 'It's theater': Michael Cohen says Trump's LA crackdown is a distraction from Musk feud
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18)
*  Happening right now, you're looking at live pictures out of Los Angeles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guard troops against the wishes of the governor [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=4.44s)]
*  and mayor, who are both urging for calm. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=9.56s)]
*  When Trump spoke earlier about the protests, he left open the possibility of invoking the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=13.02s)]
*  Insurrection Act if things turned violent. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=17.56s)]
*  Joining us now is Michael Cohen, former personal attorney to Donald Trump. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=20.8s)]
*  He's also the host of the Mea Culpa podcast and substack top-rated host at The Real Michael [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=24.68s)]
*  Cohen. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=29.38s)]
*  Laura is still here with us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=30.38s)]
*  Michael, thank you for joining the table tonight. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=32.22s)]
*  You just wrote a piece, and I want to quote a bit from it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=35.42s)]
*  It's about what's happening and unfolding right now in Los Angeles. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=38.94s)]
*  You say, this isn't tough on crime. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=41.379999999999995s)]
*  This is political theater starring soldiers in camo and directed by a man who knows deep [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=43.32s)]
*  down that his grasp on power relies on suppressing yours. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=48.56s)]
*  Why did you write this? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=52.54s)]
*  I wrote it at 4.30 this morning, by the way, which is prior to, of course, all of this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=54.9s)]
*  crazy. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=59.44s)]
*  But here's my take on it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=60.7s)]
*  Why is it that this is happening right now? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=63.1s)]
*  What's the reason that Donald Trump put out these 2,000 National Guardsmen? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=66.5s)]
*  It's not because he's concerned about signs. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=72.0s)]
*  It's not concerning, you know, remember what they had during Trump's rallies, mass deportation [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=74.82s)]
*  now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=81.22s)]
*  It's not because of the sort of signs that we have here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=82.22s)]
*  It's to distract you and the rest of the media from what's going on with the fights with [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=84.9s)]
*  Elon Musk, where he was losing that fight, where 180 million people were following Elon [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=90.14s)]
*  Musk. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=97.14s)]
*  This is just a sideshow. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=98.14s)]
*  This is reality TV. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=100.38s)]
*  Reality TV. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=102.06s)]
*  He's the best at it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=103.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=104.06s)]
*  It seems like he's been, if it's just reality TV, it's hurting a lot of lives and it's been [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=105.06s)]
*  doing so for several months. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=109.25999999999999s)]
*  Which he doesn't care about, by the way. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=110.25999999999999s)]
*  No, obviously. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=112.9s)]
*  This doesn't mean anything to him. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=113.9s)]
*  He actually wants to see people clashing with police so in that way he can justify this [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=115.42s)]
*  action. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=122.3s)]
*  But this is all distraction. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=123.3s)]
*  And we know with Trump, there's two things that he's great at. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=124.54s)]
*  Distraction and deflection. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=128.1s)]
*  You also argue in this piece that he views protest criticism as treason. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=129.78s)]
*  That serious? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=136.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=137.26s)]
*  It's treason to him. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=138.26s)]
*  And he doesn't care about anything other than you following his directives. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=139.54000000000002s)]
*  And his directive is he needs to show the American people that when he said that he [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=144.58s)]
*  wants mass deportations, he needs his numbers. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=149.98000000000002s)]
*  He wasn't getting the numbers. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=152.9s)]
*  So what does he do? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=154.56s)]
*  He creates a scenario like this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  There was no reason to deploy the National Guard. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=157.62s)]
*  Police could have handled it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=161.46s)]
*  They didn't need to show up in riot gear to Home Depot. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=162.46s)]
*  All of this again, it's theater. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=165.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=167.46s)]
*  My view on this is that he's been looking for an excuse to have a confrontation not [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=168.62s)]
*  independent of the fight with Elon Musk. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=174.34s)]
*  But it actually brings me to a question that I have for Laura, which is how should the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=176.5s)]
*  public be responding when they see, for example, masked armed men show up without badges, without [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=181.3s)]
*  warrants, without identifying themselves and take someone off the streets. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=190.3s)]
*  When they see something that looks like it might be extra legal or it's unclear what's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=194.76s)]
*  actually going on there, what should people be doing, particularly U.S. citizens, to not [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=200.16s)]
*  take Donald Trump's bait and not give him an excuse essentially to escalate further? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  It is extremely important for those who have legal status, particularly U.S. citizens, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  to be upstanders in that moment. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  Although it might be terrifying to watch, I ask that U.S. citizens who are witnessing [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=220.28s)]
*  these moments remain calm. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=224.34s)]
*  Video and tape, everything that is happening, try to get identifying details for the officers, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=227.26000000000002s)]
*  for the vehicles of the location where a raid is taking place. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=234.18s)]
*  Then U.S. citizens or other bystanders can report that information to ICE hotlines, ICE [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=238.18s)]
*  reporting hotlines that let community members know where an ICE raid has happened. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  The most important information is details, not something that will unnecessarily stoke [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=250.38s)]
*  fear and not something that might be a rumor, but grounded information. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=256.3s)]
*  And the video footage is really important. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=260.98s)]
*  We saw that in Rumseya Ozturk's arrest. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=263.16s)]
*  The footage of her arrest, the footage of her expressing her fear at being targeted [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=266.52s)]
*  by unknown masked agents spread worldwide and raised concerns about what is happening [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=272.08s)]
*  in the U.S. and what is the state of our democracy. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=280.86s)]
*  Is that going to be the only way to push back then? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=282.94s)]
*  If he is programming this like it's a reality television show, does that then mean that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=285.98s)]
*  there has to be counter programming images, ways of humanizing people, telling their stories, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=291.24s)]
*  showing an alternative perspective or literal angle, camera angle on a moment? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=296.82000000000005s)]
*  Is that the responsibility that falls on us now? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=304.38s)]
*  It is so important for the American public to understand how these immigration enforcement [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=306.02s)]
*  actions are affecting babies, toddlers, children, families, ordinary people who contribute to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=311.14s)]
*  every aspect of American life. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=317.82s)]
*  And understanding this, building empathy for the people whose lives are being completely [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=320.78000000000003s)]
*  destroyed might give those of us who care about what's happening a chance at the midterm [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=326.16s)]
*  elections. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=332.92s)]
*  Alright, just stay with us for one second. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  I do want to cross back over to Jacob Soboroff just because we're seeing these pictures, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=335.6s)]
*  live pictures of the 101. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=338.88s)]
*  Jacob, you're familiar with the terrain there and obviously the importance of that highway. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=341.0s)]
*  Talk to us a little bit about these images. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  I believe the highway now has been shut. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  And just within the last couple of minutes, we've also gotten a post from Gavin Newsom [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=351.68s)]
*  who just wrote that he has formally requested the Trump administration to rescind their [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=355.86s)]
*  unlawful deployment of troops in Los Angeles County and return them to my command. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=359.18s)]
*  We didn't have a problem until Trump got involved. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  This is a serious breach of state sovereignty, inflaming tensions while pulling resources [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  from where they're actually needed. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=370.94000000000005s)]
*  Rescind the order, return control to California. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=372.6s)]
*  You're correct, Eamon. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  Those pictures that we are looking at as Governor Newsom issues this statement is the 101 freeway. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=378.38000000000005s)]
*  As the chopper here from KNBC pans out, that is the highway that runs straight through [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=385.34000000000003s)]
*  the middle of downtown Los Angeles. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=392.36s)]
*  It is a main, an artery might be an understatement, it is one of the main freeways here in Los Angeles. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=394.8s)]
*  And what you're watching is not an unfamiliar tactic to people who watch the local news [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=401.8s)]
*  here to both protests and celebrations in Los Angeles when the Dodgers won the World [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=405.68s)]
*  Series, when the Lakers have won the championship. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=410.8s)]
*  During other protests against law enforcement or other types of civil actions in Los Angeles, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=413.88s)]
*  people have made their way down those on ramps from the overhang where you're seeing at [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=420.48s)]
*  the top of your screen down to the freeway to stop traffic on the 101. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=424.74s)]
*  And that is what we're watching play out right now. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=429.7s)]
*  Part of the reason I think that you're seeing people down on the freeway, of course, is [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=433.86s)]
*  to draw attention. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=436.26s)]
*  But also there was that pretty significant line of Los Angeles Police Department officers [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=437.44s)]
*  that are dressed in that tactical or riot gear up in the top left portion of your screen. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=443.68s)]
*  They're blocking Alameda Street. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=448.58s)]
*  There's many black and white Los Angeles Police Department vehicles you can see there. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=451.02s)]
*  And where those black and whites are at the top left of your screen is about where the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=456.7s)]
*  entrance to the Metropolitan Detention Center is. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=461.14s)]
*  It's where I was, if you were watching all in with Chris Hayes on Friday night as that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=464.36s)]
*  protest rounded that corner and headed into downtown Los Angeles. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=467.82s)]
*  It's also where exactly where those black and whites are. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=473.41999999999996s)]
*  There is a roll up gate, metal gate that ICE uses to bring people in and out of the detention [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=476.52s)]
*  center there. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=482.08s)]
*  Again, that building is known as the Metropolitan Detention Center. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=483.08s)]
*  It's a federal facility run by the Bureau of Prisons. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=486.06s)]
*  But ICE will and has been known to detain people that are picked up in its operations [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=489.15999999999997s)]
*  there. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=494.0s)]
*  So what you're seeing is both the Metropolitan Detention Center, a very heavy local police [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=495.0s)]
*  presence by the Los Angeles Police Department because the MDC is in the city of Los Angeles, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=500.36s)]
*  so it's their jurisdiction. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=505.44s)]
*  And then the protesters, some of whom I assume had been up by the MDC, now forced out because [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=506.84000000000003s)]
*  of that line that's set by the LAPD. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=513.08s)]
*  And they have moved down onto the freeway, which if you've ever been to LA, you know [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=516.38s)]
*  that's going to be one heck of a traffic jam. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=520.32s)]
*  But it's also a dangerous situation in all seriousness because those people are down [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=522.0400000000001s)]
*  there and there are a lot of people in cars trying to get to wherever they're going on [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=526.64s)]
*  this Sunday afternoon in Los Angeles. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=530.28s)]
*  Jacob, let me ask you a tactical question based on the operations that have happened [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=532.12s)]
*  in other cities and what we're seeing here. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=536.28s)]
*  Tom Homan told you last night, I believe it was, that enforcement operations in Los Angeles [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=538.12s)]
*  are going to continue. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=543.0s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong, what we've seen in other cities is when situations begin to heat [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=545.76s)]
*  up the ICE raids actually slow down and they move onto another city. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=549.48s)]
*  I mean, this started a couple of months ago where it was pretty intense in Chicago. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=553.48s)]
*  You mentioned the raid in Nashville. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=557.12s)]
*  We're seeing it now in Los Angeles. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=558.8800000000001s)]
*  But realistically, from a tactical point of view, how can an ICE operation in a city like [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=561.0400000000001s)]
*  Los Angeles continue when sentiments and tensions are running this high and you have one of [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=565.72s)]
*  the major freeways disrupted? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=569.2800000000001s)]
*  In secret is the answer, Eamon. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=574.0400000000001s)]
*  And that's what Mayor Bass told me when I spoke to her on the phone earlier. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, I asked her if she had any understanding or acknowledgement or heads up about the operations [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=579.52s)]
*  that ICE had conducted over the course of the last couple of days. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=585.96s)]
*  She didn't, nor did Governor Newsom's office when I was speaking to them yesterday around [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=588.84s)]
*  the time that I interviewed Tom Homan. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=593.52s)]
*  They go out and they do these raids, you know, when they can and without. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  I think it's again important to underscore the local law enforcement in these cities, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=602.04s)]
*  at least in Los Angeles, the LAPD, who you're looking at on your screen, and the Los Angeles [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=606.44s)]
*  County Sheriff's Department, the police is the much larger Los Angeles County. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=610.96s)]
*  LA City's got four million people. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  The county's got 10. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=616.2800000000001s)]
*  The city sits within the county and the Sheriff's Department polices a lot of the unincorporated [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=617.6400000000001s)]
*  cities. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=623.4000000000001s)]
*  There's many cities, I think 88 in LA County, but there's a lot of unincorporated parts [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=624.4000000000001s)]
*  of Los Angeles County as well. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=628.08s)]
*  Neither the Sheriff's Department nor LAPD participates in those immigration enforcement raids. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=629.72s)]
*  So if they were to continue, this is just an educated guess, my guess is that they would [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=634.52s)]
*  happen without the knowledge of the local law enforcement and move forward in areas [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=639.96s)]
*  that as you said, probably are not filled with protesters. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=645.4s)]
*  What is in the area of these protesters though is the National Guard that has been deployed [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=650.0799999999999s)]
*  to protect that Metropolitan Detention Center because ICE is inside that building. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=654.36s)]
*  One other thing I just want to point out, I think that I saw Aiman, the California Highway [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=658.88s)]
*  Patrol, they have their own set of black and whites. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=663.1999999999999s)]
*  They're in charge, their jurisdiction and they are under the direction of the governor [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=665.8399999999999s)]
*  is the highways that go through California. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=669.4399999999999s)]
*  And so if you do see a police presence down there on the 101, most likely that would be [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=671.6s)]
*  the Highway Patrol while the LAPD maintains their positions up above. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=677.48s)]
*  And from my vantage point right now, again, we have no reason to call this a riot. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=682.36s)]
*  We have no reason to call this violent. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=686.88s)]
*  Many of these protesters started peacefully earlier today in Mariachi Plaza in Boyle Heights, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=689.18s)]
*  the historic center of immigrant life in Los Angeles, where at one point it was a Japanese [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=694.26s)]
*  American community, a Jewish American community. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=700.58s)]
*  And today is known for being largely the center of Mexican American culture in Los Angeles [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=703.34s)]
*  as Sunset Boulevard turns into Cesar Chavez Boulevard and stretches towards East Los Angeles. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=708.74s)]
*  This is a moment in Los Angeles history. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=715.22s)]
*  And in 2005, 2006, we had half a million people on the streets in what was called the Gran [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=720.3000000000001s)]
*  Marcha in support of comprehensive immigration reform during the first Bush administration. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=724.74s)]
*  By no means are these protests as large, and we've seen large protests in support of immigrants' [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=730.6800000000001s)]
*  rights in Los Angeles before. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=734.38s)]
*  But there's something about this moment that feels like it's the next chapter in the history [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=737.0600000000001s)]
*  of that story that is sort of unfolding before our eyes. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=740.9s)]
*  Jacob, thank you. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=744.54s)]
*  Our panel's going to stick around. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=745.74s)]
*  We're going to continue to track the breaking news out of Los Angeles and bring you the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=747.38s)]
*  latest after this quick break. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TprmE2YED18&t=751.4399999999999s)]
