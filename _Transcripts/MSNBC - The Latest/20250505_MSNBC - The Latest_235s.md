# Hospitals across U.S. laying off staff, pausing payments amid Medicaid funding delays: WSJ
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc)
*  I'm the Wall Street Journalist reporting that unexpected delays in Medicaid funds have forced [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=0.0s)]
*  hospitals in at least 10 states to lay off staff and pause critical payments to medical suppliers. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=5.12s)]
*  Joining me now is Hilton Grateful, who is the president and CEO of the Health Care [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=12.08s)]
*  Association of Hawaii. Thank you so much for being on the program. I know you represent [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=17.12s)]
*  all 28 hospitals in Hawaii. So talk about what their experience is as a result of these delays. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  These delays, we're waiting on approximately 240 million for these hospitals in the state of Hawaii. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=30.32s)]
*  And these payments were supposed to start in January of this year. So now being May, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=38.16s)]
*  we're almost five months late in any of these payments flowing. And all of the hospitals [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  in Hawaii are not for profit. They already operate on very narrow margins. Some of them [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=48.56s)]
*  are already operating at a loss. And this delay in payments is significant. It impacts their [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=55.36s)]
*  ability to hire staff. It impacts their ability to pay their bills. And it impacts their ability [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=61.6s)]
*  to provide services to the community. We, for example, heard a story about a medical center [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=67.68s)]
*  in Washington that had to lay off 100 employees because of delays. So I guess if misery loves [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=73.6s)]
*  company, it seems like you're getting plenty of it. Are you in touch with other hospitals [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=79.6s)]
*  and other places and having conversations about what's going on? Well, we are working together. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=84.56s)]
*  We are working with the American Hospital Association. We're working with other state [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=90.88s)]
*  associations. As you said, there are multiple states involved. For us, it's an impact this [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=95.04s)]
*  year for the whole year of about 240 million that we're still waiting on and getting any of those [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=101.2s)]
*  payments. Normally they would come out on a monthly basis. We are working with our state Medicaid [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=106.72s)]
*  agency and they are doing all they can. But it appears that there is a backlog at the federal [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=113.76s)]
*  government in approving these types of payments across the country. Wall Street Journal notes [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=119.44s)]
*  that there are conservative critics of the entire federal funding program. And I'm going to quote [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=125.92s)]
*  from a health care advisor from Trump's first term who says it's just a money laundering scheme [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  that lines the pockets of hospitals. What would you say to him? Well, that is certainly not true [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=138.48s)]
*  in Hawaii, the state I represent. Our hospitals, again, every single hospital in the state of Hawaii [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=145.6s)]
*  is not for profit. Our average margin last year, 2024, was almost negative 1 percent. That means on [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=152.72s)]
*  average, every single hospital in the state lost money. That is not a good place to be in. Our [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  hospitals are vital providers. We have urban hospitals, rural hospitals. The care they provide [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=168.16s)]
*  is critical for our community and we are certainly not making money of this program. This program was [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=174.56s)]
*  designed to help fill the gap between Medicaid and Medicare. Medicare, as most people know, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=181.28s)]
*  has under, does not cover costs and has not done so for decades. This program is designed to help [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=188.4s)]
*  close that gap between Medicaid payments and costs. It's not a moneymaker. It's designed to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=197.52s)]
*  support hospitals who are providing vital care across the United States. It's an important story [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  and we thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule. Hilton Raphael, appreciate it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cTPd49Fjc&t=211.36s)]
