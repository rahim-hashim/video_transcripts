Video Description: The Supreme Court heard arguments today in the Trump administration’s birthright citizenship case. The judges will not rule on birthright citizenship itself, but instead on whether district judges have the power to block presidential policies nationwide. Hofstra University Professor of Law James Sample, former U.S. attorney Chuck Rosenberg, and staff writer at The Atlantic Ashley Parker join Chris Jansing with their analysis.

# ‘Government’s hand was weaker’: Chuck Rosenberg analyzes birthright citizenship case
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY)
*  So I'm trying to figure out, Chuck, what the implications are of that argument. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=0.0s)]
*  Is he arguing the Supreme Court is the only authority that they will respect, potentially? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=3.68s)]
*  Well, he's at least saying that they will respect the Supreme Court. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=8.48s)]
*  I mean, this is a really interesting argument. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=12.08s)]
*  Maybe only a nerd like me, perhaps James— [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=15.4s)]
*  All of us here, okay? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  A law nerd, you know, would enjoy this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=20.96s)]
*  But let's take Donald Trump and the birthright citizenship executive order out of this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=23.52s)]
*  This is really a contest between presidents and courts. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  If some president issues some order that's arguably unconstitutional, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  how can the Supreme Court resolve it efficiently, accurately, fairly, and uniformly? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=40.04s)]
*  That was the debate today. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=47.959999999999994s)]
*  What are the role of the courts? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=49.32s)]
*  What are the appropriate roles of individual judges? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=50.32s)]
*  Can an individual judge, to your point, Chris, bind the entire nation? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=53.28s)]
*  And to Justice Kagan's question, what happens in the interim? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=58.36s)]
*  What about people who are hurt by the executive order, issued by any president of any party? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=61.68s)]
*  Again, take Donald Trump out of this for a minute. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=67.16s)]
*  It's a really interesting debate that we heard today about the appropriate role of judges in our federal system [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  and how broad the authority of the lower federal court judges ought to be. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=78.44s)]
*  Well, that is critically important because the argument that it's very easy to understand [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  is that if you're someone else who's affected by the same thing that brought the person who brought the suit in the first place [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  or that was affected by the EO in the first place, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  you understand why waiting two or three or four years, particularly in the case of birthright citizenship, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=99.44s)]
*  could have real implications. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  What are the real implications for the courts and the way they've operated for a very long time? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=106.04s)]
*  They're extraordinary. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=111.2s)]
*  And to Chuck's point, and I'll be less measured than he was, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=112.48s)]
*  this was the government of the United States through the Solicitor General, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=116.92s)]
*  standing in the well of the Supreme Court of the United States, declaring war on the judiciary, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=120.88s)]
*  declaring war on the authority of the courts to step in even on constitutional matters. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=127.0s)]
*  And that might be the Second Amendment or it might be birthright citizenship. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=133.28s)]
*  You don't need to look at this through an ideological lens. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=136.52s)]
*  You don't need to look at this just through a result in a particular case or on a particular issue that you may be on one side or the other of. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=139.44s)]
*  This is a question of whether the courts have the opportunity to press the pause button [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=147.12s)]
*  when the government is doing something that is under precedent of the Supreme Court or under precedent of a particular circuit or a district, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=152.84s)]
*  deemed to be unconstitutional, pressing the pause and saying, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=161.36s)]
*  You can't do that illegal thing anymore until you get a reversal, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=165.6s)]
*  if you can get a reversal on appeal or until you can change the statute at issue or the constitutional provision at issue. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=170.48s)]
*  This is the government saying to the courts, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  you don't have the power to issue remedies to plaintiffs who are not parties to the specific litigation, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=181.32s)]
*  even if those individuals are in the exact same circumstances as individuals who had the time, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=189.64s)]
*  the resources, the wherewithal, the counsel to press a case, in many instances, all the way up to the Supreme Court of the United States. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=196.48s)]
*  That's not the rule of law. That's the rule of law for those with the resources. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=203.72s)]
*  Isn't it also the rule of practice? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=207.72s)]
*  So you bring a case that you think is a strong case that often and almost always represents essentially what a lot of people would refer to as class. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=209.68s)]
*  Action, right? There are lots of different people, but we're bringing this one or two examples. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=219.6s)]
*  Right. And the logical extension of James's point would be that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=224.6s)]
*  The number of people who might be harmed by an unconstitutional executive order are larger than the number of people who have sued to stop that practice. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=230.84s)]
*  And so how do you protect effectively those other people? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=241.36s)]
*  I mean, the government argued today that they could protect themselves. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=246.6s)]
*  Each one could go into court in each of the districts in which they live and seek relief. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=250.28s)]
*  But that seems to me, again, taking politics out of it, highly ineffective and highly inefficient. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=257.47999999999996s)]
*  And so do we want our judges and judges arguing the opposite? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=264.56s)]
*  He's saying that not to do it the way I'm arguing is the one that's inefficient. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=268.96s)]
*  Right. Well, right. I mean, look, I think both sides presented. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=273.6s)]
*  Arguments as best they could. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  My sense is that the government's hand here was weaker. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=281.32s)]
*  And did you hear that from the justices? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=284.84s)]
*  I think so. I mean, if I were better at predicting things, I would probably be down, you know, making money in some other way. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=287.4s)]
*  But I think I heard that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=295.28s)]
*  I mean, I think that the government's position is that it's hard for the government to be everywhere all the time. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=297.32s)]
*  But let's be clear, it's a lot easier for the government and the government's lawyers to be everywhere all the time than it is for individuals, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  individual citizens or, in this case, individuals who are trying to be citizens and trying to have the protections of citizenship. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=310.2s)]
*  All right. I want to bring Ashley in because, Ashley, the president has never been shy, certainly in this term, about attacking judges. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=317.12s)]
*  So I want to remind folks of just a little bit of what we've heard from him. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=323.6s)]
*  Unbelievable. You hear a judge in San Francisco or a judge in San Diego, there's nationwide adjunctions having to do with the whole country. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=327.24s)]
*  We are being hit hard by judges that I think they're trying to take away the power of the presidency. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=338.68s)]
*  They have to let us do the job that the voters want us to do. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  Judges are interfering, supposedly based on due process. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=347.88s)]
*  And then in March, the president specifically called for the Supreme Court to end what he called this toxic and unprecedented situation. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=353.16s)]
*  I wonder, Ashley, though, is it at least a political victory for the president just to get this argument before the Supreme Court? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. I mean, Chuck made the point that if you took away birthright citizenship and the politics, it's a fascinating legal debate, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=369.88s)]
*  which I have no doubt. But the fact remains politically, that is the backdrop that we are talking about, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=379.16s)]
*  that the backdrop of the case being argued before the Supreme Court, being watched by millions of people, is about immigration, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  is about being tougher in Trump's view on immigration, is about birthright citizenship, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=394.68s)]
*  and is ultimately about what was until very recently a fringe legal theory that the 14th Amendment did not guarantee birthright citizenship, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=400.12s)]
*  espoused by a very small group of people, including one person who was also a key player in Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=410.0s)]
*  is now getting talked about across the nation and in the highest court of the land. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=421.04s)]
*  That is the victory to him. That is a shifting of the Overton window, which is something he has been so good at his time on the political scene. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=425.44s)]
*  All right. So where does this go from here? I mean, obviously, the justices have heard the arguments. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=435.76s)]
*  What are the options here? Is it just yay or nay? Is there some combination thereof? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=441.4s)]
*  Normally, the Supreme Court decides the case before it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=447.12s)]
*  Could they, in theory, reach down and decide the underlying birthright citizenship case too? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=452.68s)]
*  I guess in theory, but I think that would be unlikely. More likely, they would want additional briefing on it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=460.72s)]
*  There is a mechanism to get that case before the Supreme Court quickly. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=467.64s)]
*  But again, Chris, the crucial question is, if something is unconstitutional or unlawful, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=471.96s)]
*  what is the best, most efficient, fairest, most accurate, most uniform way to get that question resolved? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=480.0s)]
*  Remember, presidents of both parties have contended with nationwide injunctions from district court judges, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=488.03999999999996s)]
*  federal district court judges who see the world differently than they do. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  So right now, it's a birthright citizenship question because Mr. Trump made it one. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=498.6s)]
*  But tomorrow, it could be a very different question. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=504.36s)]
*  It could be a different president in four years who will, you know, be have to contend with district court judges who see the world differently. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=507.0s)]
*  How do we resolve these questions? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=515.5600000000001s)]
*  I do want to touch on birthright citizenship, though, because it has been so talked about and it's so critically important to millions of Americans. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=517.48s)]
*  The 14th Amendment reads like this. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=524.7199999999999s)]
*  All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=527.6s)]
*  But today, just today, here's what the president posted. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  Birthright citizenship was not meant for people taking vacations to become permanent citizens of the United States of America and bringing their families with them all the time, laughing at the suckers that we are. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=540.44s)]
*  But James, is the president, is the administration misreading the previous ruling by the Supreme Court, which says in their minds it's essentially a blank check for the president to interpret the Constitution however he sees fit? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=553.64s)]
*  There's an answer to that question, which is that President Trump's theory is an interesting theory, but it's inconsistent with one hundred and twenty seven years of precedent. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=568.6s)]
*  It's inconsistent with a law, the 14th Amendment, which you read, that has been on the books since 1868 and the 1898 decision of the Supreme Court, as well as statutes that Congress has passed consistent with those understandings of law. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=578.96s)]
*  The president's interpretation is inconsistent with those statutes as well. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=595.64s)]
*  So if the president wants that to be the policy of the United States of America, we have mechanisms, just as Chuck was talking about the various legal mechanisms in litigation, there are mechanisms if the president wants to advocate for changing the meaning of the 14th Amendment from what it's been for a hundred and twenty seven years of Supreme Court precedent and even longer since the adoption of the 14th Amendment itself. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=599.04s)]
*  He can push for a constitutional amendment. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=623.12s)]
*  He won't get it, but that's why he's trying to do this by executive order. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_GhrJK5oeY&t=625.28s)]
