# 'Unrealistic and basically impossible': Lawmaker on why Trump's Gaza proposal is 'unhelpful'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k)
*  Joining us now is Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida, member [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=0.0s)]
*  of the House Committee on Appropriations. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=4.0s)]
*  Congressman, it's great seeing you always. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  This morning, Speaker Johnson was asked whether he supports the president's comments. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=8.52s)]
*  Here's what he had to say just a little while ago. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=13.96s)]
*  Yeah, we're trying to get the details of it, but I think this is a good development. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=16.6s)]
*  We have to back Israel 100 percent, and so whatever form that takes, we're interested [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=21.84s)]
*  in having that discussion. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=26.22s)]
*  It was a surprising development, but I think it's one that we'll applaud. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=27.92s)]
*  What was your reaction to all of this, Congresswoman? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=34.52s)]
*  Well, Jose, first of all, I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your beloved Uncle [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=37.2s)]
*  Waldo. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=41.52s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=42.52s)]
*  It's got to be tough. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=43.52s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=44.52s)]
*  And, I mean, let's just be clear. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=45.52s)]
*  Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization that fanatically attacked Israel, killed 1200 [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=49.6s)]
*  of her citizens, took 250 captive, and we have 79 hostages that remain in Gaza still [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=58.96s)]
*  being held captive. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=67.18s)]
*  And after this first phase of ceasefire and hostage release, we have to make sure that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=69.18s)]
*  all the hostages are able to be returned home to their families. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=73.7s)]
*  And so my reaction was, what are we doing to make sure that it is more likely, not less [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=79.86s)]
*  likely, that all the hostages come home and that we can start down the pathway of returning [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=86.9s)]
*  to the Abraham Accords process that was in the midst of normalizing relationships between [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=93.30000000000001s)]
*  Israel and her Arab neighbors, including and especially Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=101.30000000000001s)]
*  I was in the region on October 7th, you may remember, Jose. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=104.98s)]
*  I have returned to the region and visited many of those Arab countries and including [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=108.30000000000001s)]
*  Israel multiple times since then, and I'm going back in April on a bipartisan CODO. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=112.18s)]
*  And I co-chair this Congress, the Abraham Accords caucus. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=118.78s)]
*  So we have to make sure that we're not doing anything that is going to make normalization [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  between Israel and her Arab neighbors less likely rather than more likely. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=126.34s)]
*  And we don't need to do something that emboldens Hamas and allows them to recruit even more [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=130.34s)]
*  generations of terrorists to our hell-bent on Israel's destruction and the destruction [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=136.94s)]
*  of the Jewish people. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=142.38000000000002s)]
*  And that's what this proposal would incite in terms of the reaction and the destabilizing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=143.58s)]
*  force that pursuing this idea would have. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=150.5s)]
*  This morning, White House National Security Advisor Mike Walz was asked if the president [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=154.9s)]
*  comments meant the end of the United States support for a two-state solution. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=159.02s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=162.66s)]
*  I don't think I did certainly didn't hear the president say it was the end of the two-state [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=165.26s)]
*  solution. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=170.14s)]
*  You have the Palestinian Authority, you have the West Bank. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=171.14s)]
*  And when he was asked directly who is going to live there in the future, he said the Palestinians [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=175.94s)]
*  and perhaps many others. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=181.66s)]
*  Congressman, I just want you if you would to expand on what you were just saying because [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=184.46s)]
*  there are we're just entering right now the world is this second phase of the negotiations [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=190.26s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas to continue hopefully bringing those hostages back out of Gaza. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=196.3s)]
*  What kind of effect do you think all of this talk here could play on those negotiations? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=208.78s)]
*  I think that they would place those negotiations in serious jeopardy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=217.3s)]
*  If you listen to the statements of the Crown Prince, the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=220.9s)]
*  who I've had the opportunity to meet with and who is absolutely committed to normalization [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=227.38s)]
*  with Israel, they've made very clear that, I mean, it doesn't need to be an overnight [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=233.5s)]
*  transformation that a Palestinian state is achieved, but that a pathway to statehood for [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=238.62s)]
*  the Palestinians needs to be a part of the process. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=245.54s)]
*  I mean, the president's proposal is unrealistic, is basically impossible. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=248.46s)]
*  You do not have countries in the region who are willing to take the Palestinians, and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=257.06s)]
*  we have to make sure that we work together to establish an orderly process of rebuilding [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=263.3s)]
*  Gaza so that we can ensure that Israel and Israelis are more safe, not less safe. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=269.21999999999997s)]
*  We don't need to inflame another generation of terrorists hell-bent on Israel's and Jews' [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=275.26s)]
*  destruction. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=281.26s)]
*  And, you know, that's why Lindsey Graham and Josh Hawley and even Trump's facial expression [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=282.26s)]
*  on Suzy Wilde's, Trump's chiefs of staff's face yesterday were appalled and said that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=288.94s)]
*  these are, this is a proposal that is entirely unhelpful. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=295.94s)]
*  Cosmo, meanwhile, the Trump administration, as you know, revoked temporary protected status [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=299.73999999999995s)]
*  for almost 350,000 Venezuelans who arrived in the U.S. recently, leaving them open essentially [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=305.58s)]
*  in the future to deportations. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  I know you represent thousands of Venezuelan Americans in your district. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=312.82s)]
*  What do you say to them? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=316.94s)]
*  Jose, the fact that the Homeland Security Secretary, Cristi Noem, Donald Trump's Homeland [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=318.98s)]
*  Security Secretary, called Venezuelans here in this country who are here because they [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=325.02000000000004s)]
*  fled Maduro's oppressive and brutal regime dirtbags, I mean, the insult is breathtaking. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=330.56s)]
*  Beyond that, they have not prioritized, as they said they would, people who are criminals [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=339.56s)]
*  and dangerous to leave in the United States. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=346.98s)]
*  What they're doing is they're going after people who were lawfully here, who followed [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=349.86s)]
*  a lawful process like TPS, like the humanitarian parole system, and he's revoked that, reneged [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=353.26s)]
*  on the promise that we made to these Venezuelans who are, have fled a regime where, I mean, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=360.70000000000005s)]
*  if the memo that Cristi Noem released saying that there's been improvements in the economy [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=368.06s)]
*  and health and the criminal justice system there are true, then why are over half of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=373.28s)]
*  Venezuelans living in poverty and famine? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=379.28s)]
*  Maduro himself is a narco terrorist who is under indictment, and I mean, the health care [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=384.4s)]
*  system, I've been to the border of Venezuela and Colombia, I can tell you the health care [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=389.11999999999995s)]
*  system and people's health is decimated there. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=397.0s)]
*  The conditions are not ripe or even improved to return and deport 600,000 Venezuelans back [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=400.72s)]
*  to Venezuela to certain oppression and likely violence. Unacceptable. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=407.44000000000005s)]
*  Well, the only point that I guess, Congresswoman, that the Venezuelan government would say is [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=414.44000000000005s)]
*  that well, there have been improvements in health and the economy for members of the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=421.48s)]
*  regime. That is, I think, undisputable. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  And that smiley handshake from Trump's envoy with Maduro himself and the allowing of oil [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=430.68s)]
*  licenses to be extended very quietly, that puts billions more into Maduro's hands and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=438.76s)]
*  enriches the regime and makes it more likely that a dictator who took power for a third [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=444.90000000000003s)]
*  term is going to stay in power. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=449.84000000000003s)]
