# 'Uncertainty and fear' as Trump moves to put new tariffs on semiconductors and drugs
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs)
*  So, Brian, help us understand what the big picture is on this probe into these two aspects [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=0.0s)]
*  of our economy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=5.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=6.44s)]
*  And the probe is kind of the right way to describe this because what we're talking about [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=7.44s)]
*  here are not the same authorities that the president used to declare that 10 percent [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=9.8s)]
*  blanket tariff basically on every country around the world. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=14.16s)]
*  These are what they call Section 232 tariffs, where the president gives the commerce secretary, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=17.52s)]
*  who in this case is Howard Lutnick, the authority to investigate on the grounds of national [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=22.36s)]
*  security, whether or not certain products and exports from other countries into the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=26.36s)]
*  United States need to be tariffed at a certain rate to protect the United States. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=30.08s)]
*  So it's actually under the Section 232 tariffs that the United States was able to put in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=34.08s)]
*  place that 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=37.72s)]
*  And it sounds like he's interested in using the same process to go after the pharmaceutical [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=40.96s)]
*  industry as well as semiconductors and electronics, which as over the weekend we were a little [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=44.72s)]
*  bit confused about, did get exempted from the so-called reciprocal tariffs on China [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  at that 125 percent additional rate. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  So the problem here is that this process can take a little bit of time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=58.08s)]
*  So it might be some weeks before we hear about whether or not the commerce secretary does [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=61.72s)]
*  want to follow through on those tariffs. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=65.47999999999999s)]
*  But you can hear the president's intention and it's likely that his own appointee, Howard [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=67.2s)]
*  Lutnick, will follow through. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=70.32s)]
*  And so, Caleb, there's been so many mixed messages on the issue of tariffs and even [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  within the administration, different opinions or even basic ethos of what it is they're [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=76.12s)]
*  trying to do. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  How do you read this? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  How do investors and how do CEOs looking for the future planning see this? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they see a big cloud of uncertainty because they can't make policy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=90.4s)]
*  They can't make decisions on inventory. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  They can't make decisions on hiring, on investing because they don't know what price they're [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  going to be paying for their imports or what they're going to be taxed on for those exports. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=99.68s)]
*  So there's a lot of confusion, which is why you see a louder and louder drumbeat around [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  a potential recession, because if they can't see the future, they're just not going to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=106.84s)]
*  spend and consumers know inflation is coming. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  Consumer inflation expectations are as high as they've been since 1981, so we may not [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=113.56s)]
*  be spending either. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  That's why you hear everybody talking about a recession, not necessarily the tariffs, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  but the cloud of confusion over the tariffs, which is causing this big pullback in spending. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=122.08s)]
*  So when they're talking about concern of inflation by consumers, but the reality is that at least [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  the last recent slew of numbers show that it's not on the up and up. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=132.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's rear view mirror though, because that was before the 10%. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=137.8s)]
*  That was before reciprocal tariffs. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=140.96s)]
*  That was before retaliatory tariffs. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=142.52s)]
*  So the next inflation numbers will probably be higher unless we get more rollbacks. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=144.28s)]
*  We've seen a lot of bark here, less bite as the administration has rolled back a lot of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=148.16s)]
*  these tariffs. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=152.08s)]
*  Now on automobiles, he's willing to negotiate. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=153.08s)]
*  We saw the rollback on smartphones and tablets over the weekend. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=154.96s)]
*  This is kind of where they started now pulling back a little bit, giving a little bit more [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=157.8s)]
*  clarity. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=161.0s)]
*  So Steve, you're in the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, one of the busiest areas in [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=162.0s)]
*  the world. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  What are you hearing about the tariffs and what's the movement been like? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Jose, I've spoken to union leaders. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=173.12s)]
*  I've spoken to port CEOs. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=176.48s)]
*  I've spoken to longshoremen. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  I've spoken to small business owners. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=179.4s)]
*  I have to say the overwhelming sense and feeling here is one of uncertainty and fear. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=181.04s)]
*  About 40% of all the goods in the U.S. comes through these two ports that are right next [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=187.0s)]
*  to each other here in Southern California. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=191.2s)]
*  About half of the total business imports and exports is business done with China. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=193.28s)]
*  If these tariffs stay in place, you're talking about anywhere from a 10 to 20%. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=198.34s)]
*  These are projections from both the ports, reduction of cargo loss. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=202.62s)]
*  That means reduction of hours for workers. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=206.46s)]
*  It means reduction of business. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  It means likely a reduction of jobs. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=210.28s)]
*  I spoke to the port liaison of one of the biggest unions, the longshoremen union here [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=212.3s)]
*  in Southern California, about 15,000 members strong. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  Here's what he said about the sense of fear that everybody's feeling in this area. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=220.18s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=223.22s)]
*  40% of the nation's cargo comes through the ports of L.A. and Long Beach. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=225.22s)]
*  And so we are the economic engine for not just this region, but for the whole country. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=229.7s)]
*  And we're concerned because the cargo levels that we've seen coming through recently in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=233.66s)]
*  anticipation of the tariffs has been extraordinarily high. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=239.44s)]
*  And we're concerned that if the tariffs take hold in some form or fashion, that it could [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=243.78s)]
*  lead to the opposite and have very low cargo flow, which would impact jobs. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=249.34s)]
*  It is another busy day here at the port of Los Angeles. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=254.14s)]
*  A lot of these businesses got wind, of course, that the tariffs were going to be in place. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=257.34s)]
*  So they're trying to up front their goods, push them through before the tariffs take [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=260.86s)]
*  effect. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=264.94s)]
*  So we're already seeing about a 26% bump from this time last year, about 2.5 million of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=265.94s)]
*  those huge containers coming through these ports so far this year. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=271.58s)]
*  But that's all in anticipation of the tap running entirely dry. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=276.02s)]
*  Jose? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=279.86s)]
*  Steve Patterson, thank you so very much, my friend. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=280.86s)]
*  So, Kell, take a listen to what the president said yesterday about a possible reprieve on [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=282.90000000000003s)]
*  these Apple products that you were talking about, cell phones and other things. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=286.18s)]
*  What about any Apple products, other cell phones? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=290.98s)]
*  Look, I'm a very flexible person. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=293.86s)]
*  I don't change my mind, but I'm flexible. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=296.90000000000003s)]
*  And you have to be. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=299.54s)]
*  You just can't have a wall and you'll only go. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=300.54s)]
*  Sometimes you have to go around it, under it or above it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=303.18s)]
*  There'll be maybe things coming up. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=307.90000000000003s)]
*  I speak to Tim Cook. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=309.7s)]
*  I helped Tim Cook recently in that whole business. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=310.86s)]
*  I don't want to hurt anybody. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=315.54s)]
*  How do you process that? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=318.06s)]
*  Yeah, proximity to power. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=320.06s)]
*  Look at the inauguration seating chart and you saw some of the biggest CEOs of tech companies [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=321.42s)]
*  sitting behind the president's family there. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=325.34000000000003s)]
*  And he knows the president and his administration, how important Apple is, not just as a consumer [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=327.7s)]
*  products company, but as a stock. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=332.18s)]
*  This is one of the most widely held stocks by investors, retail investors in the world. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=334.42s)]
*  And that stock has been punished dearly over the last few months. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=338.86s)]
*  So maybe this is a way to put some wind back in the sails. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=341.86s)]
*  That stock has been punished dearly over the last couple of months, but most stocks have [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=344.82s)]
*  been punished dearly over the past two weeks. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=348.14s)]
*  Yeah, there's been a little bit of a comeback. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=350.38s)]
*  I've seen this leaking of news of maybe we'll hold back on the smartphones and the laptops. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=352.82s)]
*  And I think this is a little bit of a carrot for those tech leaders and for those tech [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  companies. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=360.54s)]
*  It's not just because we need to keep spending on their products to keep up in economic growth. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=361.54s)]
*  Again, these are the most widely held stocks in the world and especially by retail investors [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=365.38s)]
*  like us. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=369.54s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm just thinking, I mean, the R&D that they have to go forward on and the investments [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=370.54s)]
*  that they have to make are very much related to what they're going to be able to bring [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=373.98s)]
*  in if the majority of their products are made overseas. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=377.62s)]
*  Hey, Brian, is there any communication that we know of between the Trump administration [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=380.78000000000003s)]
*  and the Chinese regime on this? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=385.02s)]
*  At the highest level, not that we're aware of. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=387.42s)]
*  But I do think that this trade war with China is kind of entering a stage that's going to [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=389.38s)]
*  look very similar to the negotiations under the Trump administration's first term. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=394.06s)]
*  You'll recall at that time in 2018, 2019, it was really a trade conversation that was [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=398.26s)]
*  singularly zoned in bilaterally with the United States and China. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=403.02s)]
*  And all the attention was on the meetings down in Washington. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=406.46s)]
*  I remember all the cameras being set up down on 17th Street to see whether or not Robert [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=409.58s)]
*  Lighthizer was going to step out and shake hands with the Chinese ministers that were [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=413.34s)]
*  here to negotiate. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=417.85999999999996s)]
*  And there were, by the way, a number of dignitaries that went over to China as well. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=418.85999999999996s)]
*  So as this trade war kind of zones in on China, despite the fact that we have to remember [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=422.74s)]

*  the coming weeks and months over what types of meetings, how high level are those meetings [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=433.26s)]
*  between the United States and China? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=437.82s)]
*  Just taking advantage of the fact that both of you guys are so knowledgeable about so [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=440.06s)]

*  Yes, sir. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=451.46s)]
*  There's some agreement there. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IshwKRo_pgs&t=452.46s)]
