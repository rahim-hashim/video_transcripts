# 'Everyone needs to be on high alert': Orleans Parish DA speaks out on five inmates still on loose
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA)
*  Louisiana State Police are sharing new photos of the moment they captured a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=0.0s)]
*  fifth inmate who escaped in a New Orleans jailbreak nearly a week ago. Five [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=4.18s)]
*  more escapees remain on the loose though after officials say a maintenance [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=9.24s)]
*  worker helped them bust out by shutting off the water so they could leave [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=13.32s)]
*  through a hole behind a toilet. NBC correspondent Ryan Chandler is [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=17.48s)]
*  reporting from New Orleans. I think Ryan more than 200 officials were told are [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  working around the clock on this manhunt. What's the latest and also [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=26.52s)]
*  about that maintenance worker who's being held? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=30.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's a massive manhunt, Chris. And interestingly, it's mostly centered [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=34.72s)]
*  here in New Orleans. All five of the fugitives fugitives who have been [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=38.6s)]
*  captured were found here in New Orleans. And the police chief here says she has [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=41.76s)]
*  good reason to believe the rest are here as well. With that maintenance [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=46.0s)]
*  worker, there are some really striking details in the arrest affidavit. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=50.32s)]
*  According to authorities, that worker told them he admitted to shutting off [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=53.919999999999995s)]
*  the water in the cell, then allowing the inmates to cut through the plumbing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  and the cell wall that they eventually walked out or crawled out of at threat [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=63.16s)]
*  of violence from the inmates. He says that the inmates asked him to turn off [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=69.72s)]
*  the water and threatened to shank him if he didn't. Authorities say he should [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=73.28s)]
*  have gone directly to authorities to report that behavior instead of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=76.92s)]
*  complying. Interestingly, Chris, we just heard from the district attorney of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=80.64s)]
*  New Orleans who just wrapped up a tour of the jail and meetings with officials [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=84.28s)]
*  to try and see the security issues here for himself. He walked out and spoke to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=89.04s)]
*  the press for a little bit and he said he expects more employees at the jail [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=92.9s)]
*  to be arrested within the week. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=96.56s)]
*  Right, Chandler, thank you for that. Let me bring in Jason Williams, district [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=99.84s)]
*  attorney for Orleans Parish. Is that your expectation that there will be [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=103.04s)]
*  more jail employees, especially given the fact that by some accounts it was [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=107.92s)]
*  eight or 10 hours before anybody even reported the fact that these 10 inmates [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=113.32s)]
*  were missing? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=118.64s)]
*  Chris, that's absolutely right. I can't imagine only one individual assisted [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  from a civilian capacity to make good this jailbreak. This did not happen in [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=126.96s)]
*  a matter of moments or minutes. There was some time, there was some planning [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=134.0s)]
*  and we're going to pull in every threat until we find out who all was involved. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=139.0s)]
*  Is part of a separate investigation. I know this is probably not your your [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=143.0s)]
*  area, but we saw that someone had written it looked like in pencil above [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=148.12s)]
*  the hole where they escaped too easy. Should be T. O. O. But because I have to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=152.72s)]
*  say that are my English teacher friends will not be happy with me. But was it [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=158.62s)]
*  too easy? I mean, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=163.28s)]
*  it and especially given that at least one of these inmates had escaped [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=165.88s)]
*  previously from a different facility. So apparently had some practice at it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=171.64s)]
*  Actually, multiple of these individuals have escaped custody in the past. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=176.4s)]
*  Kindle miles escape custody as well as Massey escaping custody from an adult [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=181.6s)]
*  facility in another parish. Individuals who have made good escapes in the past [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=188.4s)]
*  certainly should not have been housed or had access to the first floor. And [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=196.0s)]
*  that is the area in which they were able to escape from. Today I was able to see [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  that pod and that cell that we're looking at right now up close and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  personal is able to see the type of bolts that were used and able to see the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=210.6s)]
*  way in which those bars were defeated. And this this should not have happened. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=215.6s)]
*  Um, this is this is a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=224.72s)]
*  when you when you look at that picture, you can see some of the measures that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=228.12s)]
*  have been taken on. It's just simply incomprehensible that inmates could have [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=232.56s)]
*  done this on their own or with the help of a single person. So what is it? What [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=237.38s)]
*  did seeing it in person? Mr District attorney tell you that will be useful to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=242.04s)]
*  your prosecution or I should say maybe ultimately prosecutions plural. I'm not [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=247.34s)]
*  gonna say anything that I think would jeopardize the investigation with the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=252.8s)]
*  prosecution. But if you're talking about how bars were cut, it's important to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=256.48s)]
*  know whether or not there was soot marks to suggest that some sort of heat or [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=262.22s)]
*  torch was used or if their strike marks are cut or cuts on the side of that to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=268.16s)]
*  suggest that some sort of cutting instrument was used. So I wanted to know [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  what evidence there was that we would be able to use in court to connect this [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  with whatever tool or instrumentality was used so we could figure out where [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  that tool came from and who used it. A bond was set for the maintenance worker [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  at $1.1 million. That's more, at least in my limited experience, covering these [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=292.4s)]
*  kinds of stories than many for felony murder. Why was it set that high? You [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=298.67999999999995s)]
*  know, we didn't set the bond, but we thought a high bond was necessary. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=303.96s)]
*  Obviously, he is not charged with a homicide himself talking about Sterling [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  Williams. But based upon what we know right now, he aided in releasing a [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=314.2s)]
*  convicted murderer onto the streets. And that's a very, very serious offense. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=319.92s)]
*  One of these individuals was gang affiliated. There are a number in the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=325.48s)]
*  homicides, the double homicide that he committed happened when he shot [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=331.16s)]
*  indiscriminately into a crowd of women and children and men at a Mardi Gras [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  barbeque. So what he has done is put the public in real danger and therefore he [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=343.04s)]
*  is dangerous. What's the level of fear in the community right now? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=350.88000000000005s)]
*  The level of fear is high, as it should be. Everyone needs to be on high alert [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=355.64000000000004s)]
*  and remain on high alert until these remaining fugitives are in custody. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  These are desperate men, and I believe that they're only going to get more and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=365.32000000000005s)]
*  desperate over time as their friends and families who may have thought or helped [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=369.8s)]
*  them early on realize that the circle is tightening and they become desperate as [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=376.2s)]
*  well and they will find fewer and fewer places to hide. So the fact, as I've [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=381.88s)]
*  said before, that someone has not gotten hurt by one of these individuals trying [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=386.64s)]
*  to take a car and get out of the parish, that is just the grace of God. So we all [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=390.08s)]
*  need to be on high alert in the system and out of the system. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=396.52s)]
*  Jason Williams, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ7e0l9VDYA&t=399.56s)]
