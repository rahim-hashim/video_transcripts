Video Description: You’ve probably seen footage or photos of people protesting the Trump regime. Some data suggests that the volume of protestors is higher than in Trump’s first term. But at the same time, you might be wondering if we’re seeing enough civil resistance to preserve American democracy. Our guest this week is one of the authors of a study that found that just 3.5% of the population taking to the streets is enough to block authoritarian takeover. Erica Chenoweth is a political scientist at Harvard. They join to discuss historical and contemporary strategies for protesting, democratic backsliding, global comparisons and more. 

“Why Is This Happening?” is produced by Doni Holloway and Brendan O’Melia, engineered by Bob Mallory and features music by Eddie Cooper. Aisha Turner is the Executive Producer of MSNBC Audio.

# 'We have everything we need': Harvard political scientist on resisting Trump 2.0
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU)
*  Hello and welcome to Why is this Happening with me, your host Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=0.0s)]
*  You probably have seen footage of protests in the first hundred days of the Trump administration. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=14.4s)]
*  I've played them on my program. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=18.64s)]
*  Rachel Maddow has been doing an amazing job collating different protest footage. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=20.04s)]
*  At one level, it's incredibly heartening to see lots of people out on the streets. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=25.48s)]
*  I've gone to sort of in a reportorial capacity to go see some of these protests as well. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=30.36s)]
*  There's a few of the Tesla takedown protests I've gone and checked out. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=35.56s)]
*  And there's some data suggests that in terms of the volume of protests and the places they're [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=40.6s)]
*  happening, it's actually more widespread now than it was in Trump's first term. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=46.04s)]
*  And that at the same time, it also feels like there's nowhere near as many people in the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=51.6s)]
*  streets as I kind of feel like there would be or should be. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=55.92s)]
*  It's particularly true when you look at some of the protests that have happened recently, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=61.44s)]
*  for instance, in Hungary, where there's hundreds of thousands of millions of people on the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=64.92s)]
*  streets. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=68.72s)]
*  So there's a kind of weird disconnect. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=69.72s)]
*  At one level, there clearly is a vigorous protest movement in the United States that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=72.0s)]
*  is growing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=77.64s)]
*  You see it growing, I think, just in sort of anecdotally. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=79.19999999999999s)]
*  And we can talk a little bit about the data. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=83.0s)]
*  And at the same time, a weird disconnect between what to me feels like the scale of the aggression [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  towards the democratic order and the amount of people that are responding by joining protests, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=90.36s)]
*  particularly when you compare it to, say, 2020, where we had millions of people quite [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=97.8s)]
*  literally in the streets. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=103.44s)]
*  In fact, by some measures, the biggest civil rights protests nationally that had ever happened. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=104.52s)]
*  And obviously, there was the combination of the sort of intensity of that COVID period, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  the acuteness of the horrific footage of what had happened in Minneapolis to George Floyd. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=118.4s)]
*  But just in a term of the numbers sense, like, we don't have that same specific acute visual [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=125.96s)]
*  provocation and human provocation of this awful cold blooded murder that we're witnessing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=132.23999999999998s)]
*  So that's part of it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=139.28s)]
*  But I've been wrestling with this question of, like, why aren't there more people in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  the streets? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  And what would what would it mean if there were a million? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  Like, is that the way to protect American democracy? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=147.64s)]
*  Does it matter that those numbers are low? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't matter they grow? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=152.16s)]
*  I've been sort of thinking through this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  And one thing that maybe you've seen floating around the Internet is this idea. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=154.88s)]
*  It's kind of been memeified that like if 3.5 percent of a population are in the streets, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=161.04s)]
*  that's sufficient to block an authoritarian takeover. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=168.0s)]
*  And I was like, I saw this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=172.56s)]
*  I've seen it a bunch of people, places. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=174.56s)]
*  It's become almost one of these like, if you get your 10,000 steps in sort of things on [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=176.44s)]
*  the Internet. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=180.36s)]
*  And I was like, what is that real? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=181.36s)]
*  What's the deal with that number? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=182.36s)]
*  Where does it come from? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=185.36s)]
*  Well, it is real. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=186.36s)]
*  It comes from real research by a scholar who, along with a few collaborators, has been probably [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=187.4s)]
*  one of the most in-depth and sustained scholars studying exactly this question of civil resistance, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  nonviolent civil resistance in societies undergoing authoritarian backsliding or even societies [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=200.0s)]
*  and democratic, open democratic societies, and how basically people using nonviolent [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  civic protest work, when it succeeds, when it fails, under what conditions. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=211.12s)]
*  And Erica Chenoweth is one of the authors of the piece that found that 3.5 percent number. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=217.08s)]
*  They're a political scientist at Harvard University, and their work has been studying exactly these [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=222.88s)]
*  questions, both in the U.S. domestic context and some international comparative questions [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=229.84s)]
*  about basically protest and the power of protest, particularly to stop authoritarian [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=234.64s)]
*  backsliding. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=241.76s)]
*  So I thought Erica Chenoweth would be a great guest for WithPod. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=242.76s)]
*  So Erica, welcome to the program. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=245.83999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=247.6s)]
*  So glad to be here. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=248.6s)]
*  Did I get your academic work broadly right? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=251.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=256.76s)]
*  So I would say that a lot of my work has focused, as you say, with collaborators and solo work [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=257.91999999999996s)]
*  has focused on the question of how do people effectively struggle against authoritarianism [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=264.36s)]
*  or prevent democratic backsliding into authoritarianism using people power? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=269.88s)]
*  And where has that worked? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=275.24s)]
*  When it hasn't worked, why not? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=276.94s)]
*  And that's been a kind of primary focus of my work. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=279.36s)]
*  And you know, on the question of thresholds, how many people does it take? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=283.6s)]
*  I would say we don't know exactly. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=288.64s)]
*  What we know is what has happened in the past in other places in similar contexts, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=291.24s)]
*  one might argue. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=297.62s)]
*  And at least from 1900 to 2006, we didn't know of any or I don't know of any nonviolent [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=299.1s)]
*  mass movements for democracy that failed after achieving three and a half percent active [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=307.76s)]
*  participation in a peak moment of that movements cycle. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=315.12s)]
*  But there are some important caveats, as you would expect. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=320.68s)]
*  The first is that we can't be sure that we're always observing the full range of both participants [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=323.82s)]
*  and especially sympathizers. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=329.0s)]
*  So three and a half percent sounds like a low number. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=331.2s)]
*  It's a massive number in absolute terms. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=333.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=335.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=336.8s)]
*  And it usually suggests that there is a much broader range of support for the movement [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=337.8s)]
*  than just people actively participating in that movement. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=343.68s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  It means that this is at a peak of a movement that has been building over the years, building, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=347.78000000000003s)]
*  organizing, you know, engaged in lots of other low level tactics, protests, non-cooperation, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=353.54s)]
*  everyday forms of resistance, staying relatively under the radar to build that level of capacity [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=361.42s)]
*  to where there is some big breakthrough moment that you see those really spectacular numbers [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=367.26s)]
*  of people participating. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=373.74s)]
*  So it's a descriptive number, I would say, but not necessarily a prescriptive number [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=376.6s)]
*  for what we might expect. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=381.32000000000005s)]
*  Based on the data that you've compiled, and this is something you and collaborators have [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=383.44s)]
*  done sort of the first time, right, is one of the things you've done is actually just [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=388.0s)]
*  assemble a kind of, my understanding, a kind of database of different forms of nonviolent [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=392.3s)]
*  protests, civil resistance in different societies and when they were happening and how they [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=399.0s)]
*  were happening and how many people were participating, basically? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=404.68s)]
*  Exactly. So Maria, Stefan and I first established what's called the Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=407.6s)]
*  and Outcomes Database or the NAVCO database, and what it is is it's just looking at every [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=413.32s)]
*  case of a mass movement that was demanding the ouster of a dictator, usually, an incumbent [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=418.06s)]
*  national leader, or the creation of a new country through secession, anti-colonial action, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=423.4s)]
*  you know, military occupation campaigns. So they're maximalist or revolutionary campaigns, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=429.67999999999995s)]
*  if you will. These are like everything from the Algerian Revolution on the sort of armed [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=434.28s)]
*  conflict side to the Polish Solidarity Movement, right, that was breaking through an authoritarian [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=438.96s)]
*  regime there in the 80s. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=446.11999999999995s)]
*  So basically, what we're looking at there is we're comparing, our initial study was [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=447.64s)]
*  to compare the effectiveness of the ones that were using people power techniques as their [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=453.03999999999996s)]
*  primary mode of resistance, so unarmed, ordinary people engaging in civic action, compared [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=456.92s)]
*  with armed insurgency. And our study, which was published in 2011, Why Civil Resistance [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=464.12s)]
*  Works, just reports the fact that the unarmed resistance movements of the 20th century were [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=470.04s)]
*  much more likely to succeed than their armed counterparts and that they were much more [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=475.48s)]
*  likely to result in democratic transitions, like way more likely to result in democratic [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=479.84s)]
*  transitions than armed insurgencies. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=484.48s)]
*  So what happened then is that after that book came out and there was opportunity to engage [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=487.44s)]
*  with activists on key questions about why this is happening and what their experience [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=493.2s)]
*  was, one activist at a workshop asked me, is there a critical mass of people that's [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=498.44s)]
*  required to have nonviolent movements succeed? And I said, I don't know, but there's a guy [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=503.96s)]
*  named Mark Lickbach, another political scientist at Maryland. In his book, about what he calls [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=509.47999999999996s)]
*  the rebel's dilemma, there is a mention of what he calls a 5% rule that probably you [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=515.36s)]
*  don't get more than 5% of the population ever participating in an uprising, and also that's [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=521.72s)]
*  probably all it takes. And he sort of casually mentions this and speculates that in his book, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=526.6s)]
*  and so that's probably a fair guess, but let me open our database and see if we can, if [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=531.88s)]
*  that's true. And I saw that actually above the 3.5% figure, we hadn't seen any failures [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=538.88s)]
*  at that point. And so that's what then motivated a talk that I gave and then some writing that [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=544.64s)]
*  I've done later on the 3.5% rule. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=550.48s)]
*  I want to stay with this comparative stuff because I think it's really interesting just [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=554.4399999999999s)]
*  on the, talking about the Algerian independence movement, which was an armed movement for [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=558.92s)]
*  sure, versus solidarity, which was nonviolent. Why was it in your understanding in this comparative [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=564.52s)]
*  sense that nonviolent movements, A, had more success and B, led to democratic transitions? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=573.4s)]
*  Yeah, so in our book, Why Civil Resistance Works, Maria and I say that there are really [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=580.4s)]
*  four things that nonviolent movements do better than armed campaigns. The first is that they [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  get way more people involved. So you're just much more, right, it's just a much more inclusive [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=591.8000000000001s)]
*  set of methods of resistance that are accessible, familiar, visually obvious of where you even [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=597.9200000000001s)]
*  go to participate, how you would get involved. It's not a secret. It's actually usually quite [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  open at a certain point, how people would participate. People can come in casually. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=609.44s)]
*  They don't have to commit to be fugitives for the rest of their lives. And there are [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=615.0s)]
*  all kinds of reasons why that then allows it to build the sort of base participation [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=619.96s)]
*  that is often quite confounding for armed movements. The second piece is that because [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=626.4000000000001s)]
*  of that very large participation, which is usually inclusive of lots of people from all [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=632.5600000000001s)]
*  walks of life, that activates political, social, and economic networks that leverage into power, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=637.1600000000001s)]
*  right? So the more people you have, the more networks you can tap into to start breaking [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=644.1600000000001s)]
*  apart the opponent's pillars of support, whether that's the economic and business community, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=648.68s)]
*  whether that's security forces, whether it's state media, cultural and religious authorities, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=653.64s)]
*  civil servants, et cetera, everybody's related to somebody at some point in society. And [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=659.5999999999999s)]
*  so that starts to activate those networks. And you'll see in dramatic cases like the [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=664.0s)]
*  Serbian oat poor movement that helped to bring down Milosevic. It's often described how it [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=669.64s)]
*  had a key point in Belgrade when hundreds of thousands of Serbs went to demand that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=676.92s)]
*  Milosevic leave office after a stolen election. The police did receive an order to fire on [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=682.04s)]
*  the demonstrators and ignored it. And a bunch of journalists and academics went in to interview [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=690.12s)]
*  them and find out what happened. And they would say things like, I thought I saw my [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=696.0s)]
*  kids in the crowd, right? So that's what happens when you get very large and diverse numbers [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=700.48s)]
*  of people participating is that you can't disconnect those relationships with the state, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=706.12s)]
*  right? And that starts to break down those pillars of support. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=712.08s)]
*  So these contexts we're giving, Milosevic is interesting because it was ostensibly a [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=718.72s)]
*  democracy at that point and he tried to steal an election. In the case of Poland, obviously [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=724.08s)]
*  you're dealing with a state that was under both sort of domestic, communist party, one [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=730.36s)]
*  party rule and also Soviet influence. In the case of South Africa, you have a first armed [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=735.8s)]
*  and then nonviolent movement to displace the apartheid system. None of those feel like [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=744.38s)]
*  perfect analogies to what we're going through, obviously. How do you think about what we're [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=751.28s)]
*  experiencing now in the context of that kind of broad spectrum of different civil resistance [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=758.88s)]
*  you've studied? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=765.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So you're right to say that every case is different and the United States has had [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=767.2s)]
*  its own experience with authoritarianism. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=774.6800000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=777.4000000000001s)]
*  Right? And so usually the best reference point for what a country is going through is its [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=778.1600000000001s)]
*  own past. So Jim Crow is the obvious example of where we had like sub-state is what you [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=781.9200000000001s)]
*  would call it, like sub-national levels of authoritarianism. And before that in different [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=789.5999999999999s)]
*  periods we had authoritarianism for, that was much more nationwide and we also had authoritarianism [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=795.3199999999999s)]
*  for different groups and things like that. So this is not like unfamiliar territory for [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=801.12s)]
*  the United States. What I would say is that the way I describe the moment we're in is [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=805.16s)]
*  in a backsliding episode and I think that there are a lot of other political scientists [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=812.88s)]
*  out there who study democracy and authoritarianism who agree with that. There is a lot of debate [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=817.12s)]
*  about how acute the episode is and how far down it might go. I think the conventional [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=822.68s)]
*  understanding is that the likeliest scenario is that the U.S. winds up in some kind of [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=830.36s)]
*  competitive authoritarianism system, which is what Steve Levitsky and Luke and Wei would [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=837.4s)]
*  call it. And that just basically means that all the trappings of democracy are there. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=842.08s)]
*  There's still constitution, there's still elections, there are nominal freedoms on the [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=847.6800000000001s)]
*  books and things like that, but they're sort of arbitrarily enforced and protected and [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=854.0400000000001s)]
*  the opposition is so effectively bullied off the playing field is their analogy that basically [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=859.5600000000001s)]
*  it's very difficult for them to compete in elections. It's very difficult for people [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=866.9200000000001s)]
*  to speak out and oppose what's going on and it just becomes more costly to be part of [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=871.36s)]
*  the opposition and the costs start to degrade the willingness of people to actually compete. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=877.76s)]
*  That's what people say is sort of the likeliest endpoint to where we might end up. I don't [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=886.32s)]
*  know what the likelihood is of getting there and actually that state consolidating, but [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=892.6s)]
*  I do know that in such situations the problem is that the institutions themselves are often [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=901.88s)]
*  so compromised or sidelined that they can't themselves provide the protection for democracy. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=910.38s)]
*  In their book that they wrote about eight years ago, Steph Haggard and Bob Kaufman argue [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=918.4s)]
*  that in cases of near misses, that is countries that were sliding and then reversed course, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=923.34s)]
*  the reason they did so is because of strong civil society mobilization. The fact that [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=929.68s)]
*  people basically were able to form some kind of united umbrella of civic institutions, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=935.64s)]
*  grassroots groups, and they were able to push back in every domain of society against intrusions [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=942.64s)]
*  by authoritarian aspirants. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=950.8399999999999s)]
*  The idea that I've read some of your work on this, which seems pretty crucial to me, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=954.16s)]
*  even a mass movement is not a majority of people in the streets. It's some kind of vanguard, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=963.0799999999999s)]
*  but a very large one. Not like the much smaller cadres of say, arm cells, which are for a [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=969.04s)]
*  whole bunch of reasons very small. Even a mass movement, hundreds of thousands of millions [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=976.1999999999999s)]
*  of people participating, it's still a small percentage of the population, but it can be [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=981.08s)]
*  effective in a, representing larger mass opinion, and b, crucially, there are pillars of power [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=985.96s)]
*  that are not the regime that can be brought over. Talk a little bit about what those are, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=992.62s)]
*  because again, I think everyone's in a new... People have an old framework for America, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1000.76s)]
*  and an incomplete one. All civil society was corrupted in the Jim Crow South. All the stuff [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1007.8s)]
*  we're talking about was present there in its own ways. Universities weren't like, sure, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1014.4s)]
*  come have a black professor come lecture in an integrated classroom at Ole Miss. That [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1022.3199999999999s)]
*  wasn't happening. Civil society was co-opted as part of the authoritarian regime down there [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1027.4s)]
*  that's not totally alien to our history. Yet at the same time, I think we do take an open [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1031.6s)]
*  society for granted. We take civil society for granted, so much so that we don't think [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1036.3799999999999s)]
*  about what it is. I do think it's worth talking about what it is, because I think once you [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1040.26s)]
*  talk about what it is, it is so clear how much that is the target of what the first [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1045.3s)]
*  100 days of the Trump administration has been. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1052.3s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. Good question. What is civil society? A lot of times it's the sort of institutions [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1054.9399999999998s)]
*  of learning, of culture, of the sort of associational life of a country. It could be everything [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1061.94s)]
*  from nonprofit sector to religious institutions to the sort of business community and networks [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1071.22s)]
*  of business, like chambers of commerce and professional associations, things like that. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1081.26s)]
*  It's really everything that isn't the state as a formal organization, but it's a way that [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1087.26s)]
*  people organize themselves in associational life to try to make the democracy thrive. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1093.7s)]
*  Educational institutions are part of that for sure. I think the business community is [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1100.7s)]
*  really important in most cases. Where it decides to put its lot is often very decisive. You [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1107.14s)]
*  brought up South Africa. What's really interesting there is that unlike the case of Serbia, it [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1114.94s)]
*  was not going to be the case that black activists organizing out of the townships, strikes, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1121.94s)]
*  boycotts, stayaways, marches, were going to be able to get the police to defect. That [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1129.42s)]
*  was just not an option. It wasn't part of the strategic landscape of possibility there. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1136.42s)]
*  The methods reflected that. They weren't about actively confronting security forces. They [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1144.5400000000002s)]
*  were about putting huge amounts of pressure on the business community. That was through [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1150.3400000000001s)]
*  the withholding of buying. The anti-apartheid movement had multiple campaigns that were [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1156.66s)]
*  just fully economic non-cooperation. No buying, no working. Then building the types of networks [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1162.46s)]
*  that were necessary to sustain the community in periods of deprivation over the long term [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1170.46s)]
*  because of that. Then at the same time, there was a huge international campaign of pressure. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1175.46s)]
*  That's multinationals divesting and sanctions that were coming from other countries and [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1182.46s)]
*  international institutions. In the end, it was the business community that went to the [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1188.46s)]
*  national party and said, you have to elevate a reformer here to do business with the ANC. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1194.66s)]
*  We have no choice. There's no way out of this. That pressure is what resulted in the balance [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1199.66s)]
*  of power shift there. I think that's very instructive because I think so many people [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1205.3400000000001s)]
*  have learned this thing, including autocrats by the way, that you don't want your security [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1211.14s)]
*  forces to defect. Those aren't the only pillars. There are lots of other pillars in the business [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1214.66s)]
*  community. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1222.14s)]
*  It's interesting because when I think of civil society, I don't think of the Chamber of Commerce. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1222.66s)]
*  In my own way of thinking of it, it's the state, then there's the business world, then [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1230.5s)]
*  civil society is everything else from PTAs to churches to universities to museums to [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1235.02s)]
*  arts organizations to everything. All those don't have as much power as the business community. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1240.5400000000002s)]
*  It's important to think about the business community as probably one of the key fulcrums [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1247.62s)]
*  of power after the state. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1253.98s)]
*  I think that's right. They're one of the pillars. There are other pillars. In some societies, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1257.22s)]
*  it may be that state media is the most important one without being able to fray a little bit [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1266.42s)]
*  the loyalty of state media that it's going to be very challenging no matter what the [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1273.42s)]
*  business community says. It's too easy to intimidate and co-opt the business community [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1280.42s)]
*  in some places because it's so far down. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1284.8600000000001s)]
*  There are lots of varieties of this. I think the key insight from a lot of scholars of [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1290.18s)]
*  civil resistance is just that there's no such thing as a monolithic entity against whom [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1296.26s)]
*  a movement would resist. There's always going to be the need to replenish loyalties, the [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1302.7s)]
*  need to make sure that the people who have to go along in order for the autocrat to [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1309.38s)]
*  get their way are going to continue to go along. That just creates infinite opportunities [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1315.0800000000002s)]
*  for them to second-guess whether that's in their own personal interest to do that. The [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1320.4s)]
*  reason why so many movements have won is because they've made a pretty good argument that it [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1325.46s)]
*  was not in their personal interest to continue, whether it's because they saw their kids in [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1330.9399999999998s)]
*  the crowd or because they realized there was no possibility for economic prosperity in [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1335.06s)]
*  this country that they wanted to live in and there was a path out of it if they took a [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1339.7s)]
*  different direction. Those are the types of points of pressure that successful movements [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1346.26s)]
*  create. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1352.58s)]
*  I think that gets a little bit back to your own question at the outset, which is does [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1354.06s)]
*  protest matter? Well, it really matters if it builds pressure and if it builds base and [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1360.14s)]
*  if the mass that's assembled from that translates into real pressure. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1366.1s)]
*  How much does mass opinion matter? This is something I've been really wrestling with. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1372.74s)]
*  I'll give a quick gloss on this. In Orban has won a series of elections, Steve Levitsky, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1379.14s)]
*  who you referenced before, I think has a great way of thinking about this competitive authoritarianism, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1386.3000000000002s)]
*  which is like elections that are free but not fair. They're not stuffing ballot boxes. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1390.1000000000001s)]
*  They're not doing even what Erdogan did, which is arresting the opposition leader, but they're [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1396.42s)]
*  not fair elections because of how the system's been essentially rigged to make it very, very [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1401.0600000000002s)]
*  difficult to be the opposition. But in the case of Orban, he's popular to the best that [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1407.0200000000002s)]
*  we can measure public opinion there. He has been a popular figure. Narendra Modi in India, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1413.1399999999999s)]
*  to the best that we can measure public opinion is quite popular. Bukele in El Salvador, again, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1421.22s)]
*  all this stuff is imprecise, but to the best we can measure is fairly popular. Trump is [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1429.62s)]
*  not popular to the best we can measure. I think that matters, but I can't tell if I'm [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1434.3s)]
*  just desperately clinging to some life raft of hope. It seems to me to matter, but I wonder, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1440.7s)]
*  as someone who studies this, whether you think it matters. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1447.7s)]
*  Yeah. So what's interesting about our country and our country's institutions is something [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1450.8600000000001s)]
*  that Steve Levitsky and Danza Blatt wrote in their more recent book, The Tyranny of [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1459.28s)]
*  the Minority, which is that we have institutions that are minoritarian institutions. In other [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1463.5s)]
*  words. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1469.5s)]
*  Explicitly. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1470.18s)]
*  Right. And so the implication of that is that maybe popularity matters slightly less in [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1470.94s)]
*  this country than it would in another that didn't have the same kind of setup already [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1480.6200000000001s)]
*  structurally in our institutions. So I do think it matters, but I think there's a lower [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1486.1000000000001s)]
*  floor here than there might be in a lot of other authoritarian regimes because of this [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1492.66s)]
*  protection that incumbents get from the benefit of our minoritarian institutions. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1498.38s)]
*  That's interesting. Meaning just that the way that I see this, which really manifests [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1504.38s)]
*  is the Republican Party's gotten very comfortable at 40% approval. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1511.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1515.46s)]
*  Where, but 80 to 90% approval among Republicans, the biggest threat of primaries, and the Senate [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1516.6200000000001s)]
*  right now, the way the Republican Party coalition works gives them a kind of advantage with [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1524.62s)]
*  that body. And so altogether, it's like the sky's not falling if it's 40%, whereas if [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1529.62s)]
*  it Democrats at 40%, you get a lot more panic. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1535.1799999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1538.78s)]
*  Yep. In terms of our institutions and in terms of this moment, does how strategic versus [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1540.06s)]
*  haphazard do the moves made on the other side from Trump look to you? I've been unnerved [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1547.06s)]
*  by how, well, here's my read on it. I've been unnerved by how methodically they have gone [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1561.06s)]
*  after civil society, like law firms, universities, parts of the business community that they [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1568.82s)]
*  can then cut tariff deals with. It really does seem like they do not believe in a free [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1574.06s)]
*  and open society and they want to bring it under their control. And they're taking the [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1579.6599999999999s)]
*  steps they can to use the levers of power they have to do so. At the same time, they [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1584.78s)]
*  also do seem to be shooting themselves in the foot on a lot of stuff, particularly starting [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1589.26s)]
*  a trade war that might send the economy into recession. But given that you've sort of studied [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1593.08s)]
*  this kind of game theory back and forth between how regimes deal with civil resistance movements, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1599.58s)]
*  what's your read on what they've been doing? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1605.58s)]
*  My read is that there are a lot of assertions of executive power. So EOs are laws. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1608.86s)]
*  Record-setting assertions. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1617.82s)]
*  They're not laws, but they're assertions of executive power. They're assertions of a political [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1619.7s)]
*  project. They're kind of a roadmap for where the administration would like the country [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1624.82s)]
*  to be. So if we take it at its word, then I think it's very clear that the administration [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1631.82s)]
*  wants to bring civil society to cooperate with implementing Donald Trump's vision for [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1641.9399999999998s)]
*  the country. And I think precisely because it's been done through executive orders, the [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1649.5s)]
*  primary way that civil society is pushing back is through litigation. And primarily [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1657.6200000000001s)]
*  litigation that questions the authority of the executive to make and do these things. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1665.9s)]
*  So in a sense, that's sort of appropriate. But I think that's also why there's an attempt [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1672.98s)]
*  to bring the legal profession onside and to have this army of lawyers at the ready to [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1678.5s)]
*  do all of the litigating. Because I think his own experience, maybe as a businessman [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1685.5s)]
*  too, is simply that litigation is sort of how it happened. Everything is litigated. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1690.98s)]
*  And you just have to win a handful of suits. And so it's sort of not very costly to just [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1698.94s)]
*  do stuff all the time that is going to invite litigation because probably some of it you'll [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1706.3400000000001s)]
*  win. And if you win a few really important things, then you really go far in expanding [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1712.3400000000001s)]
*  people's understanding of what your authority is. So it's sort of like moving the overton [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1718.94s)]
*  window. And the fact that a lot of the litigation won't be sorted for a few years. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1723.7s)]
*  The time part of it, right? Like, oh, yes. Oh, well, and this is why all this fight over [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1730.7s)]
*  injunctions. But like, oh, you know what? You got to reconstitute USAID and start giving [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1735.34s)]
*  everyone their HIV medication in the global south three years from now. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1741.78s)]
*  Right. Yeah. And so this is like lawfare. It's job owning is like a word that some legal [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1746.58s)]
*  scholars use to describe just and it's something we've seen in other countries where people [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1753.06s)]
*  just get tied up and sort of distracted by it, like how much they have to defend what [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1760.1599999999999s)]
*  they're doing and the First Amendment itself and things like that. And yet it's so important [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1764.82s)]
*  in countries where this is happening that people do do that because they're also asserting [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1772.34s)]
*  rights. And they're also asserting the rule of law by doing that. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1775.74s)]
*  Yeah, that was going to be my question because I do think in certain lefty circles, you'll [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1779.1799999999998s)]
*  hear this phrase, the courts won't save us. And there's a little bit of this like, doomerism [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1784.98s)]
*  about the rule of law and about the courts and particularly, I think, understandably [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1789.6799999999998s)]
*  a 6 3 Supreme Court in which, you know, there's three members who have been appointed by him [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1793.96s)]
*  and two more who have not been appointed by him who are, you know, zealots ideologically [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1799.4s)]
*  and incredibly aligned with his vision in Alito and Thomas. And so it's interesting [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1805.28s)]
*  for me to hear you say, no, actually, the civil litigation is part of I guess what I'm [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1812.72s)]
*  hearing you say is institutions using civil litigation, whether that's General Block, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1817.48s)]
*  the law firm or universities like Harvard or others that are going to sue are examples [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1822.34s)]
*  of people power in a different channel, essentially. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1829.26s)]
*  Yeah, and there are two really direct impacts that litigation can have. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1834.8999999999999s)]
*  The first is that it enters into the public record documentation of the facts. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1839.58s)]
*  Yeah. And that kind of thing is just so important in a world in which that people are [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1843.6599999999999s)]
*  trying to claim, you know, figure out what is true. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1849.7s)]
*  You know, having suit filed like establishes facts. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1852.7s)]
*  And that's really important. The second way that it has a direct impact is that sometimes [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1856.66s)]
*  there are pretty immediate rulings that protect space for dissent and assembly, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1861.1000000000001s)]
*  and things that are like so foundational in our constitutional order that like if they're [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1867.8600000000001s)]
*  not going to hold, it's better to know. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1873.3400000000001s)]
*  Right. As soon as possible, but actually so far seem to be pretty unanimously supported [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1876.14s)]
*  by the courts. And then then the question is, OK, what do you do when the courses can't [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1883.3400000000001s)]
*  enforce the law? Right. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1887.7800000000002s)]
*  Because they don't have that constitutional authority. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1889.5800000000002s)]
*  And that is the question. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1893.5s)]
*  Right. If if if the administration starts to violate Supreme Court orders or ignore [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1895.2600000000002s)]
*  them or ignore a few of them, more than one and once that are really important, then, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1901.1s)]
*  you know, we are in a different we're a different category of country at that point. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1907.3s)]
*  But again. Probably, you know, in my opinion, on a sort of strategic level, better to [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1911.54s)]
*  know sooner than later. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1917.58s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, as I was speaking to you now and I don't know what will be the case when [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1918.98s)]
*  people hear this. You know, they're kind of ignoring the Supreme Court on Kilmore [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1922.3s)]
*  Brigham Garcia, who is the Maryland man who's been. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1928.06s)]
*  Wrongfully or in error, deported to El Salvador and immediately imprisoned in a notorious [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1932.1399999999999s)]
*  prison there, CICOT, which we've all seen the pictures of the court is ruled nine [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1940.86s)]
*  oh, that sort of upholding the notion of the district court judge, they have to facilitate [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1945.26s)]
*  his removal a little bit of a question of what facilitate means, but I think it's fair [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1950.34s)]
*  to say they're not facilitating his removal. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1953.94s)]
*  And in fact, you know, the president just said in an interview, I could get him back [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1955.7s)]
*  if I wanted to. So, you know, and and part of the thing that's a little weird to me. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1959.18s)]
*  And I wonder. I'd love to hear you talk about this. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1965.7s)]
*  Trump is weirdly good at testing lines in a way that is. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1970.22s)]
*  Crescendo lists, if that makes a sense, he it's sort of like, see if he can get away [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1976.8600000000001s)]
*  with it, maybe taking a step back, taking another few steps forward testing. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1982.66s)]
*  You know, the only real like, you know, January 6 was the. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1987.9s)]
*  Was when it all. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1992.98s)]
*  There was no kind of plausible deniability, even that it was go down and protest peacefully. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=1995.26s)]
*  He doesn't. He's not going to get up on the balcony and give some thundering sort of. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2002.42s)]
*  Obviously, authoritarians slash fascist speech about how he's defying the court. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2009.18s)]
*  It's going to be if he does it, it's going to be in exactly the way it's happening now, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2014.46s)]
*  which to me does it makes it harder to galvanize public opinion precisely because of that. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2018.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one of the difficult things about backsliding in general is that there [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2026.5800000000002s)]
*  are no bright lines. Yeah, right. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2031.14s)]
*  And so people often find out what the world they're in after the fact. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2032.9s)]
*  And that's what makes this wave of global autocratization, as they call it, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2037.34s)]
*  much more like the one that was in the 1920s and 30s than the one that was in like the 1960s [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2042.18s)]
*  and 70s, because in the 60s and 70s, there were bright lines. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2047.58s)]
*  There was a coup outright by the military, right? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2050.62s)]
*  Declaring themselves, you know, the caretaker government. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2053.82s)]
*  Or there was an armed revolution that won and ousted, you know. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2057.3s)]
*  And so that was very obvious. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2060.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's one country. And now you're not. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2062.94s)]
*  We're in a different world where most of the autocrats or aspiring autocrats today [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2064.98s)]
*  are elected authoritarians. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2070.62s)]
*  And that's like it was in the 20s and 30s, where, you know, they're actually put into [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2072.1s)]
*  power through elections generally and then actually begin to dismantle the state [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2076.42s)]
*  and bring it under their control. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2083.42s)]
*  And so that's what we've seen in similar or we've seen similar attempts around the world. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2085.42s)]
*  In the current wave of autocratization, you brought up the case of Hungary and attempts [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2092.2599999999998s)]
*  that we saw to do similar types of executive kind of auto coups or things along those lines [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2097.42s)]
*  in Brazil and in Poland. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2103.54s)]
*  We've also seen civil society mobilization pushing back against that in several of these [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2106.5s)]
*  cases and doing so effectively, at least temporarily. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2109.94s)]
*  But it is very disorienting for people because they accept that the government is doing [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2114.02s)]
*  disorienting for people because they expect one morning to wake up and the sun is not [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2120.38s)]
*  out. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2125.02s)]
*  It feels dark. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2126.02s)]
*  It feels dangerous. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2127.02s)]
*  It feels different. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2128.02s)]
*  And actually, most of the time, most people's lives just kind of keep going until all of [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2129.7000000000003s)]
*  a sudden they realize that stuff is happening that is much less predictable. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2134.5s)]
*  They can't figure out why so and so isn't showing up at work anymore. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2138.98s)]
*  And they begin to be afraid. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2143.46s)]
*  And the sense of fear and social silencing happens even before people know. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2144.94s)]
*  This to me, I mean, partly our cultural vocabulary on this tends to be either communist dictatorships [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2151.9s)]
*  or the Nazis. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2160.7000000000003s)]
*  And these, you know, there's a reason that the notion of totalitarian is distinct from [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2163.7000000000003s)]
*  authoritarian and like we tend to think in a totalitarian terms, partly because of the [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2168.94s)]
*  Cold War, the popularity of 1984 because of Hannah Arendt's work on this that like I've [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2174.54s)]
*  been to Turkey under Erdogan. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2180.62s)]
*  It is not a free society in the way that I would want to live in a free society. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2183.3s)]
*  But I've been to art galleries and to universities. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2187.7400000000002s)]
*  I've met with students. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2190.58s)]
*  I met with members of the opposition party. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2191.58s)]
*  I went like I wasn't being followed by a minder. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2193.82s)]
*  I wasn't. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2197.1400000000003s)]
*  It didn't feel it felt. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2198.2200000000003s)]
*  Not that different from other places. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2201.9s)]
*  So that almost tactile feel that people have this image in their head of like, yeah, one [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2205.2200000000003s)]
*  day to the next. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2213.26s)]
*  You know, that's not there. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2214.26s)]
*  I do think it's like a huge part of the difficulty of communicating to me the scope of what their [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2216.46s)]
*  ambition is in terms of how much they want to undo the constitutional democratic order. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2223.7000000000003s)]
*  I think Masha Gessen has written some really useful things about this lately, which is [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2231.78s)]
*  just about that. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2237.42s)]
*  That sometimes it is a subjective thing that people who are the most vulnerable can tell [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2239.34s)]
*  you about at the soonest. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2242.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2243.98s)]
*  So the people who are like the ones named in the executive orders as being out of line [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2244.98s)]
*  or being criminal or whatever can tell you the soonest, whether it feels like an authoritarian [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2250.1400000000003s)]
*  context or not. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2257.86s)]
*  People ought to listen to them because in a democracy, nobody feels like they live in [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2259.46s)]
*  an authoritarian regime. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2263.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2264.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2265.34s)]
*  That's well said. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2266.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2267.34s)]
*  That's really well said. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2268.34s)]
*  How you use this term non-cooperation, which is something that runs through your work and [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2269.34s)]
*  the work of other people who work on civil resistance. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2273.54s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2276.5s)]
*  Explain unpack that concept of it. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2278.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2280.7000000000003s)]
*  Non-cooperation is part of the kind of tactical toolkit that Gandhi brought to bear on the [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2281.7s)]
*  Quit India campaign. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2290.66s)]
*  And he had actual whole campaigns of what were called the non-cooperation campaigns. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2293.46s)]
*  And what in his context it was about was not going along with unjust laws at all. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2298.1s)]
*  So for example, the salt march in I think 1930 was an attempt to go and break the British [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2304.9s)]
*  monopoly on salt and the exports of salt from India without people living there being able [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2313.5s)]
*  to consume it themselves. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2319.54s)]
*  So he went and broke the salt law and was arrested eventually and everything. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2322.9s)]
*  The idea is to withhold participation or withhold cooperation from things that benefit effectively [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2329.1s)]
*  the opponent. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2337.06s)]
*  The way people often talk about it now is more like direct economic non-cooperation. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2339.66s)]
*  So methods like strikes or boycotts are forms of economic non-cooperation. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2344.72s)]
*  And that just means that people won't buy things. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2350.7799999999997s)]
*  They won't go to work. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2352.82s)]
*  And these methods, the reason that they matter so much and whether campaigns end up winning [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2356.78s)]
*  or not often is precisely because they impose direct material costs almost immediately. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2363.7000000000003s)]
*  I got to say I am kind of amazed by the Tesla takedown movement in this respect because [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2370.86s)]
*  it, essentially as far as I can tell, and I've talked to some people working on it, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2376.2200000000003s)]
*  entirely grassroots. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2383.7400000000002s)]
*  There's not really any professional organizers or NGOs and maybe some monies come in. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2385.2599999999998s)]
*  But ironically enough, it's the opposite of what the White House and Musk have said about [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2389.9799999999996s)]
*  it. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2395.02s)]
*  It's genuinely grassroots. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2396.02s)]
*  And it is imposed incredibly striking material costs on the world's richest man in a very [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2397.4199999999996s)]
*  short period of time through something that is not nowhere near as dramatic an ask as [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2404.18s)]
*  going on strike, which is forfeiting your pay. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2412.48s)]
*  It's just like, don't buy this dude's cars. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2414.84s)]
*  And it's been, I mean, in just dollar terms, when you look at the share value of Tesla, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2418.2000000000003s)]
*  when you look at the sales, when you look at the material costs it has imposed, it is [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2422.88s)]
*  really striking how effective it's been. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2426.6400000000003s)]
*  The term boycott itself comes from the tactics first target, a guy named Captain Boycott, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2430.1800000000003s)]
*  who was an absentee British landlord in County Mayo, Ireland. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2437.1600000000003s)]
*  A bunch of women associated with the Irish Ladies' Land League realized that if they [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2442.66s)]
*  refused to sell him products, they refused to launder his clothes, they refused to clean [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2451.1s)]
*  his house, they refused to make him comfortable in any possible way when he came to town to [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2457.46s)]
*  collect rents, he would not come back. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2463.7s)]
*  And that's what they did. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2468.04s)]
*  And the term boycott caught on from there. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2469.7s)]
*  He was so ostracized from the society, he never returned. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2473.58s)]
*  And so that is the sort of origin of the technique is to basically... [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2477.54s)]
*  One really malevolent rich dude is literally the origin of the term. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2485.8199999999997s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2492.22s)]
*  So non-cooperation can, when it imposes material costs, obviously can have a real effect. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2493.68s)]
*  Litigation can have an effect. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2501.9199999999996s)]
*  What is the actual power of people in the streets? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2506.8399999999997s)]
*  What is it? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2510.8999999999996s)]
*  What is it doing? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2511.8999999999996s)]
*  I mean, why does it work when it works? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2512.8999999999996s)]
*  At so many levels it operates. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2517.3199999999997s)]
*  So at the personal individual level, a lot of people first recognize their agency and [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2519.5s)]
*  the sort of collective power of showing up and doing something for the first time when [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2525.42s)]
*  they attend a protest. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2530.74s)]
*  Scholars have talked about the sort of educative potential of just even one person showing [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2533.54s)]
*  at a protest and seeing that others care about the same issue, they're committed to it, like [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2538.16s)]
*  a person isn't alone about their concerns. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2543.54s)]
*  Maybe it's fun, maybe it's interesting, maybe it's novel, and you learn something from it. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2546.66s)]
*  You learn new ways of articulating the demands that meet where you're at. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2550.98s)]
*  And so there are actual findings from research in India by Christian Davenport that shows [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2556.9s)]
*  that when people participated in protests against untouchability, that they were much [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2565.2200000000003s)]
*  more likely to see untouchability and discrimination toward Dalits later. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2571.96s)]
*  So in other words, they learned from being at the protests with their feet to look for [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2577.94s)]
*  it and they could see it more often. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2583.1200000000003s)]
*  So that's just like on the very micro level. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2584.7200000000003s)]
*  And then at the macro level, there's all kinds of impacts. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2587.88s)]
*  We have lots of political science scholarship that shows the impacts of participation in [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2591.32s)]
*  protests on electoral outcomes. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2595.96s)]
*  It affected the 2010 midterm elections when the Tea Party kind of insurgent took over [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2598.86s)]
*  the GOP. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2603.42s)]
*  That was like directly tied to how many people turned out at the 2009 April 15 Tea Party [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2604.5s)]
*  protests. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2609.98s)]
*  There's research showing a very similar dynamic on the other side with the 2018 blue wave [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2611.42s)]
*  being directly tied to the number of people turning out at women's marches in 2017. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2616.1400000000003s)]
*  And then you mentioned 2020, the summer of 2020 and the number of protests and people [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2621.02s)]
*  participating in protests that summer unprecedented in this country. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2628.94s)]
*  And a paper came out two weeks ago showing the direct impacts that that had on vote share [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2633.7400000000002s)]
*  in the 2020 presidential election. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2638.1400000000003s)]
*  So even the electoral impacts are massive. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2641.0600000000004s)]
*  And in this country, even having one or 2% of a vote share change in election calls the [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2646.1800000000003s)]
*  whole game, right? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2653.26s)]
*  In competitive elections. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2654.26s)]
*  So that matters there. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2655.86s)]
*  And then, you know, it matters in articulating kind of new ideas, things that need to be [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2657.38s)]
*  on the agenda that people aren't paying attention to. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2665.3s)]
*  It provides opportunities for people to even have arguments and debates about what we should [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2668.6600000000003s)]
*  be doing and forcing our elected officials to be part of that conversation and be accountable [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2673.7400000000002s)]
*  to their constituents between elections. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2680.02s)]
*  So I just think there are so many documented reasons why protest is really important. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2682.66s)]
*  It's just that in the context of a backsliding episode, in the context of authoritarianism, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2688.02s)]
*  protest alone, that is like street demos alone, and the absence of other things like non-cooperation [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2694.8199999999997s)]
*  and the ability to elicit defections and these sorts of things and a plan for when repression [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2700.62s)]
*  escalates, the movement doesn't get thrown off course. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2704.98s)]
*  You know, those things are also really crucial capacities. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2708.58s)]
*  And street demonstrations rarely can do the trick by themselves. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2711.9s)]
*  You just said a plan for when repression escalates. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2715.54s)]
*  And let's talk a little bit about that. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2718.82s)]
*  You know, there's some work Omar Wasow, who's a scholar who also studies civil resistance [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2721.98s)]
*  in the context of the civil rights movement, has some great work about just how powerful, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2727.62s)]
*  you know, backlash to police repression and violence towards civil rights protesters was. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2734.1s)]
*  And he does some amazing work kind of measuring this empirically. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2740.7799999999997s)]
*  If you read the great book, The Race Beat, which is about sort of northern New York Times, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2744.9799999999996s)]
*  northern newspaper reporters reporting on civil rights movement, you know, one of the [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2750.22s)]
*  things that comes through is just how incredibly focused King and civil rights leaders at that [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2754.22s)]
*  time were on media representations of the movement and eliciting sympathy from particularly [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2760.5s)]
*  northern white audiences towards protesters because they were getting their brains bashed in. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2770.58s)]
*  I mean, it was it was they understood exactly what was happening. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2776.8199999999997s)]
*  How a how how often does repression come like physical repression, violence, how do movements [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2780.5s)]
*  deal with it and how much does that backlash effect matter? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2790.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2793.54s)]
*  So in the database that Maria and I collected, something like 88 percent of the campaigns [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2794.62s)]
*  experienced some form of violent direct state repression. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2800.9s)]
*  The range of lethality varied. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2805.2599999999998s)]
*  And then update to that database that I published a couple of years ago with Christopher Shea, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2808.98s)]
*  we found that just as sort of a point of fact that the average nonviolent campaign, so one [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2813.3s)]
*  that stuck to a people power path suffered something like 22 times fewer casualties [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2819.76s)]
*  or fatalities than the average armed campaign. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2829.2000000000003s)]
*  So like there's like a significant. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2832.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2834.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2835.88s)]
*  But not zero fatalities, right. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2836.88s)]
*  So but just way fewer. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2838.28s)]
*  And part of it is exactly because of this backfire effect that there's almost like a [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2840.32s)]
*  not a guarantee, but a higher probability that people will see the violence toward unarmed [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2846.7999999999997s)]
*  people who are very disciplined as unjust and disproportionate and worthy of, you know, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2853.64s)]
*  condemnation. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2861.08s)]
*  And sometimes those moments are where you see the defections happen among security forces [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2862.48s)]
*  or important people in the business sector or whatever. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2867.6s)]
*  And it's also sometimes where more people start to pour into the movement to support [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2871.42s)]
*  it because it just is such a galvanizing thing for people to see. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2876.14s)]
*  I mean, kind of worldwide, there's there's two things I think that are often like standard [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2880.46s)]
*  triggers for mass mobilization. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2885.7000000000003s)]
*  One is a stolen election, a really stolen election, one that kind of everybody agrees, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2888.52s)]
*  including supporters of the tyrant work was probably stolen. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2895.14s)]
*  The other is an episode of state violence, an episode of state violence, including police [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2898.46s)]
*  brutality or whatever mobilizes in a much more predictable way than other triggers like [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2903.82s)]
*  price shocks or something like that. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2910.7s)]
*  That's really interesting. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2912.82s)]
*  Those two things are the kind of that signal stands out in your data. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2913.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2917.78s)]
*  How how good a job do you think we're doing American civil society right now? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2918.78s)]
*  Well, you know, I think that I would say that the United States Civil Society has all the [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2925.9s)]
*  ingredients it needs. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2932.6600000000003s)]
*  And Zoe Marks and I wrote a paper a couple of years ago just saying that if if there [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2935.0200000000004s)]
*  was some kind of major backsliding episode, it would be very useful to think about what [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2941.0200000000004s)]
*  other countries have done in that context and and and trying to think about bringing [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2946.98s)]
*  civil society together and into some kind of united pro democracy alliance or or or [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2951.18s)]
*  network of some kind so that there was some coordination. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2958.46s)]
*  But but that, you know, even in the recent past, even during the first Trump administration, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2961.42s)]
*  American civil society was quite awakened. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2968.74s)]
*  And and there was a very high level of coordination. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2972.06s)]
*  There's a lot of real talent and experience in the country. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2975.06s)]
*  And I think that the country has all the ingredients it needs. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2979.5s)]
*  My my mentor, one of my mentors is the Reverend James Lawson, who passed away a couple of [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2982.3s)]
*  years ago, sort of a towering figure in the Nashville campaign of the civil rights movement. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2988.38s)]
*  And and at some point, he said to me that when when they were planning their actions [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2992.86s)]
*  during the early days of the civil rights movement, he said we had Gandhi's autobiography [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=2999.2599999999998s)]
*  in the Bible and do you have training manuals and you have all the research and you have [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3005.26s)]
*  everything to know like you, you know, you've got everything you need. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3010.94s)]
*  So, you know, that that's encouraging, too. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3014.78s)]
*  And and I sort of often hear him in my head with the with the sort of implication that [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3017.7400000000002s)]
*  that we have everything we need. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3026.0600000000004s)]
*  The you said coordination, which strikes me as a really key word here. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3028.46s)]
*  I mean, watching watching the development of first Trump issuing these just facially [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3033.02s)]
*  unconstitutional, like ludicrously authoritarian executive orders directed at a specific law firm [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3040.3s)]
*  because of who they hired, right, because of who they work for. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3046.78s)]
*  It's like squarely First Amendment protected freedom of association and seeing it work [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3050.06s)]
*  and watching law firm after law firm kind of cut deals with him and then seeing the people who [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3056.78s)]
*  wouldn't, you know, roll over and then watching some of those firms start to coordinate and [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3061.26s)]
*  amicus briefs watching the same thing with universities with Columbia and then watching [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3068.1400000000003s)]
*  Harvard's response and then watching now a sort of mutual aid pact coming together. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3073.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, this coordination element seems to me just obviously essential. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3078.2200000000003s)]
*  And it's what's key is that it happened at the level of these pillars where they're [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3083.34s)]
*  where there's already huge repositories of social capital and political power. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3091.1s)]
*  I think that's right. That's absolutely right. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3095.34s)]
*  And and you know, I think we have you might call that grass tops coordination. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3097.34s)]
*  And then there's also grassroots coordination. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3103.9s)]
*  That's really important, too, because, you know, this this type of work is the effects [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3105.7400000000002s)]
*  of these things are going to be felt, you know, where people live and work and are trying to be [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3111.58s)]
*  together as families. And so, you know, I think that that, you know, it's an interesting it's [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3116.62s)]
*  just sort of an interesting moment in American history to see to see people actually really [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3123.2599999999998s)]
*  trying to ask these questions and find the right reference points both for themselves and both for [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3129.74s)]
*  this country and with regard to comparisons elsewhere to figure out how best to respond [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3137.1s)]
*  to this moment. And, you know, I'm you could you could make the argument that [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3143.18s)]
*  that the response is quite slow, but it still is the first 100 days of the administration. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3150.46s)]
*  That's true. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3154.7799999999997s)]
*  And I think actually that people have been trying to figure out exactly what what kind of [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3155.5s)]
*  and groups and institutions been figuring trying to figure out exactly what kind of [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3161.1s)]
*  situation they are in. And like you say, pulling together and learning from others is a really [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3166.22s)]
*  good way to get to that answer quickly and then find appropriate responses that will actually [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3172.46s)]
*  like amplify and magnify the power of everyone at once. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3178.2200000000003s)]
*  One of the things that comes through in a lot of the chronicles of the civil rights movement, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3183.02s)]
*  which I think is, you know, the most successful American example of nonviolent, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3186.7s)]
*  non-cooperation civil resistance, probably one of the most successful in the history of the world. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3193.26s)]
*  Like I was saying was this focus on the media and mass opinion and particularly [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3198.22s)]
*  this kind of Archimedean leverage of the the big network nightly news, right, like the the [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3203.7400000000002s)]
*  the dogs being unleashed to children or the water hoses. And then that gets broadcast and [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3214.3s)]
*  it gets broadcast to 80 million people and 80 million people all see the same images. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3221.7400000000002s)]
*  And we just live in a totally different information environment now. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3230.3s)]
*  And that's true in it's true in Hungary. It's true in Turkey. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3234.5400000000004s)]
*  In those places that are much further down the road, huge amounts of the information [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3238.78s)]
*  environment have just been co-opted and brought alongside to essentially reflect state media, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3243.42s)]
*  even if they're not state media. We're watching tons of attempts to do that in real time from the [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3250.54s)]
*  right wing influencers brought into the, you know, into the briefing room to attempts to [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3257.42s)]
*  threaten and bully media outlets. How much does that information environment matter? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3262.86s)]
*  And how much does it connect to what my understanding is that some of your work [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3269.18s)]
*  recently has been about the sort of a little bit of the decline in the success of some of [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3272.38s)]
*  these movements in the last decade. And you see this in Hungary and Turkey where there really are [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3277.98s)]
*  popular movements. I mean, Turkey has had huge protests that are having a harder and harder time [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3282.62s)]
*  dislodging authoritarians. How much is that the changing information environment part of the story [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3288.06s)]
*  here? Yeah, no, it's a huge part of the story. I mean, Satyagraha, one of the meanings is truth force. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3293.9s)]
*  And, you know, Gandhi called his autobiography, My Experiments with Truth. And Václav Havel talked [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3304.2200000000003s)]
*  about the irresistibility of the truth as something that, you know, could help bind together people who [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3311.34s)]
*  could, you know, wanted to be free in spirit because they were seeking the truth. And so, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3319.26s)]
*  like, you know, the sort of authoritarian adaptation to that and our digital information [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3323.7400000000002s)]
*  kind of world is just to co-opt and effectively trash the information space, right? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3330.3s)]
*  So dominating the information ecosystem, whether it's through social media or traditional media, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3340.86s)]
*  is part of the story. But so is just the enhanced surveillance capacity that our current [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3351.1s)]
*  environment provides. I mean, you know, on the one hand, people leave digital traces of their [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3358.38s)]
*  political opinions and activities all the time on social media and whatever. But on the other hand, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3363.58s)]
*  they barely even need to because they're carrying around their cell phones all the time. And, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3368.62s)]
*  you know, it's sending information to various apps, you know. So the difference between the sort of [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3372.3s)]
*  propaganda era of the 20th century authoritarian regimes and what we're in now is that people [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3378.62s)]
*  actually just volunteer their information much more than they did at that time. You could sort of [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3387.98s)]
*  just go under the radar and just not listen to the news, not participate in a lot of political [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3393.58s)]
*  talk or whatever now. But you weren't really volunteering your movements and stuff, right? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3400.38s)]
*  And so that's just a different beast altogether. There are also governments that are very good at [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3405.5s)]
*  just manipulating the availability of the internet at all. So, like, in Myanmar after the coup, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3411.98s)]
*  there was this big civil disobedience movement that rose up and that was gathering a lot of [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3416.94s)]
*  momentum early. And the government crackdowns were extremely intense and violent and very [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3421.98s)]
*  brutal towards some of the key kind of emergent leaders, shall we say. And so, they what they did [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3431.58s)]
*  was shut down the internet when they would do raids and things like that. And then they would [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3440.06s)]
*  turn it on so that there was an announcement of what had happened to some of the people. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3444.3s)]
*  And that was just terrible, awful, torturous stuff. And then they would shut it down again so that [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3447.9s)]
*  people would be terrorized but not able to use the internet to coordinate a response. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3452.94s)]
*  Wow. So, like, there's a very sophisticated, very sophisticated understanding about manipulating that [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3457.02s)]
*  information environment to demoralize and demobilize people. And maybe a less [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3465.26s)]
*  capacity on the part of movements to adapt to that. Now, it's adaptable, but it requires a lot of [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3471.98s)]
*  awareness and strategic forethought and some capacities for building new media and [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3479.7400000000002s)]
*  new narratives and things like that that can break through. And so, it's just it's tougher terrain. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3484.38s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. Are you, I mean, I'm sort of impressed by how [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3489.7400000000002s)]
*  analytical and dispassionate you are about all this. I try to be too. I mean, people are always [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3497.66s)]
*  like, oh, what's your job like? And I try to be to a certain extent just because I'll get filled with, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3504.14s)]
*  I'll overrun my somatic system if I don't. But like, where are you right now about how [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3510.7799999999997s)]
*  we're going to come out of this? I always got to keep the faith, Chris, and take it a day at a time. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3519.1s)]
*  And today you and I are talking on your show and I had a pretty normal day at work and [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3525.1s)]
*  it's just one day at a time. That's how I'm feeling. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3534.2999999999997s)]
*  All right. I think we can, I think we'll take that one day at a time. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3541.5s)]
*  Erica Chenoweth is a political scientist at Harvard University. They study nonviolent civil [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3545.42s)]
*  resistance, author of numerous books and studies and it's really a great pleasure to talk to you. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3551.42s)]
*  Thank you so much. Likewise. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQSEpI9oqU&t=3557.26s)]
