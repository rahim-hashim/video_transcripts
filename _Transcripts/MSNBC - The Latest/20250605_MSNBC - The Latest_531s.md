# ‘They deserve each other’: Sen. Markey weighs in on Trump-Musk public feud
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U)
*  Joining me now is the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, Ed Markey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=0.0s)]
*  It's good to have you, Senator. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=5.4s)]
*  There's a lot going on, but first I want to ask you about that young man. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  He may be released on bond, but there is more court appearances ahead of him. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=9.86s)]
*  Is your office just getting inundated with calls from some of these folks at what's happening [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=14.08s)]
*  to them, and what can be done? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=19.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=21.72s)]
*  Marcello is a star student. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=22.96s)]
*  He is an honor student. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  He is a star athlete. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=28.16s)]
*  He has never done anything wrong in his life. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=31.0s)]
*  He has gone to elementary school and high school without any incident. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=33.82s)]
*  He's been a week waiting to be exonerated. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=39.32s)]
*  ICE made a mistake. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=42.08s)]
*  They should just say, we made a mistake. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=43.2s)]
*  We're not going to charge this young man with a crime. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  He hasn't done anything wrong. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=47.28s)]
*  But no, they're unwilling to do that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=48.82s)]
*  And that's what's creating a terror across America. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  We saw the same thing with Ramesa Ozturk, the graduate student who was a Fulbright scholar [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=55.6s)]
*  who was whisked off the streets of Somerville, Massachusetts, Tufts University. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  They just moved her to a prison outside of Baton Rouge, never charged her with a crime, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=66.08s)]
*  kept her behind bars for 45 days, and still haven't charged her with a crime. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=70.88s)]
*  So there's an intentional goal which the Trump administration, which ICE has, to build a [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=77.64s)]
*  terror which they're doing into students all across our nation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=83.72000000000001s)]
*  And that, by the way, is also compounded by this announcement by the Trump administration [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=89.04s)]
*  that they're going to block any international students from going to Harvard this year. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  So it's all intended to create a reign of terror in our nation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  And Marcelo is just one more example of that pattern of conduct which is absolutely, it's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  abhorrent. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  It's completely contrary to all of the values that our country should stand for. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=113.92s)]
*  The other ongoing debate that has been roiling Congress, and I don't need to tell you this, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  is this mega bill, the mega spending bill. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=122.84s)]
*  It includes, of course, cuts to Medicaid that Republicans say aren't cuts. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  They're to preserve Medicaid. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=132.6s)]
*  But it led to a pretty intense back and forth between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=134.52s)]
*  Trump was in the Oval Office. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=142.92s)]
*  He was with the Chancellor of Germany. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  He goes after Musk. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=146.64s)]
*  Musk in real time goes back after him. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=148.64s)]
*  But I want to just read to you a couple of the key exchanges on social media between [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=150.72s)]
*  the richest man in the world and the most powerful man in the world. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=156.48s)]
*  Elon Musk writes, without me, Trump would have lost the election. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  Dems would control the House, and Republicans would be 51 to 49 in the Senate. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=163.32s)]
*  Such ingratitude, to which the President of the United States responded, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=169.0s)]
*  I would have won Pennsylvania, regardless of Elon. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=174.52s)]
*  I'm very disappointed with Elon. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=177.16s)]
*  He knew this bill better than anyone, and he only developed a problem when he found [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=179.72s)]
*  out I would cut the EV mandate. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=184.2s)]
*  I wonder what you make of this back and forth, given that it is Donald Trump's bill and that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=187.68s)]
*  it is Elon Musk who came into the administration with Doge. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=194.48s)]
*  Well, again, from my perspective, they deserve each other, and there is almost an inevitability [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=199.48s)]
*  to this falling out that has occurred. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=206.64s)]
*  But Elon Musk always understood that Doge was going to stand for the Department of Gutting [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=209.68s)]
*  Electric Vehicles. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=217.44s)]
*  That was made very clear by the Department of Energy, by the Trump administration, by [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=219.16s)]
*  the EPA, right from the very beginning of Inauguration Day, that they were going to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=223.52s)]
*  cut all of the tax breaks for electric vehicles, as well as solar, as well as wind, as well [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=229.36s)]
*  as electric batteries, that they were going to destroy the clean energy future in our [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=233.96s)]
*  country. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  And why were they going to do it? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  They were going to do it for the oil industry, because we put 70 percent of the oil which [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  we consume in our country into gasoline tanks. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=245.12s)]
*  And so Speaker Johnson is from Louisiana. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  That's an oil state. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=250.88s)]
*  And Johnson's saying, no way we're going to continue those tax breaks for Tesla or for [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=252.28s)]
*  any electric vehicle manufacturer in our country, because the oil industry, the gas [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=257.6s)]
*  industry, control the Republican Party even more than Elon Musk. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=263.16s)]
*  And he's now learning this, that it is, that GOP really stands for Gas and Oil Party. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=266.44s)]
*  And I think it's a little bit of a shock to him, but it shouldn't be, because all along [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  he was told that these cuts were going to happen to all the clean energy subsidies. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  And now, after protecting StylLink, getting federal help, doing the same thing for SpaceX, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=284.52s)]
*  he's now coming in with crocodiles here saying, why can't you help me with my electric vehicle [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=290.96s)]
*  company as well, because my shareholders are getting concerned that the valuation of the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=295.68s)]
*  company is going down. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=300.72s)]
*  And it's really just hypocrisy and stilts. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=302.44s)]
*  That's all Elon Musk is engaging in right now. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=305.24s)]
*  And this battle, unfortunately for Trump, is inevitable, and I think it's going to continue [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=307.76s)]
*  on indefinitely. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=312.98s)]
*  Since you mentioned clean energy, let me look at a bigger picture, because as of now, this [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=314.94s)]
*  bill also includes cuts to the climate advancements that were made under former President Biden. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=318.94s)]
*  And this is a day that new data shows that carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere are [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=324.58000000000004s)]
*  the highest they've been likely in 30 to 40 million years. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=329.26s)]
*  You've been one of the leading members on the Hill sounding the alarm on climate change [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=334.66s)]
*  for years. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=338.74s)]
*  Is the hope for fighting climate change at least legislatively dead? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=340.5s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=346.62s)]
*  The planet is running a fever. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=347.82s)]
*  There are no emergency rooms for planets. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=349.7s)]
*  So we have to engage in preventative care. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=352.02s)]
*  Last year, 2024, in the United States, 94% of all new installed electrical generation [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=354.42s)]
*  capacity was wind and solar and batteries. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=361.74s)]
*  That's what's frightening the natural gas industry. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=365.82s)]
*  They want to produce electricity in our country while emitting fossil fuels. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=367.86s)]
*  But of course, we're seeing the damage. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=372.98s)]
*  Hurricane Milton, Hurricane Helene, $300 billion of damage last fall in just a two-week period [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=374.38s)]
*  of time. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=382.22s)]
*  The fires in LA, $135 billion worth of damage. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=383.22s)]
*  So my hope is this, that the IRA actually has had 80% of the jobs and the funding go [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=387.18s)]
*  to red states. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=394.86s)]
*  That's where the new wind and solar and all-electric vehicle and battery plants are being constructed [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=396.58s)]
*  all across our country. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=402.58s)]
*  So my hope is that the economics of this issue, while those red states will play a difference [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=404.09999999999997s)]
*  in the decision-making of Republican senators so that they get to actually have the jobs [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=410.97999999999996s)]
*  — by the way, 800,000 jobs are at stake across our country if all of these cuts stay in place [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=418.26s)]
*  — and those jobs largely are in red states in our country. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=427.0s)]
*  So we're working to have this conversation with Republicans. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=430.0s)]
*  Otherwise, we might as well just hand over with a gift-wrap package the clean energy [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=433.68s)]
*  industry, the all-electric vehicle industry to China, along with the biotech industry [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=438.44s)]
*  that Trump has also committed to eviscerating in our country. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=444.8s)]
*  In other words, give away the future for young people in our nation. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=448.4s)]
*  So we're going to work very hard with Republicans to protect those clean energy tax breaks. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  They're job creation engine for our country, and they're mostly in the red states who [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=459.24s)]
*  are going to be benefiting for a generation. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=465.48s)]
*  It just won't be jobs. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=467.92s)]
*  It'll be a career for the young people in each one of those states. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  So we're hopeful that we can be successful. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=472.14000000000004s)]
*  We're talking with Republican senators just to explain what's going to happen, especially [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=474.36s)]
*  I'll say this, with AI going to dramatically increase the amount of electricity we need [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=480.28000000000003s)]
*  in our country. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=486.24s)]
*  We're going to need all the wind and solar and battery technologies that we can produce, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHv4yJB-H8U&t=487.24s)]
