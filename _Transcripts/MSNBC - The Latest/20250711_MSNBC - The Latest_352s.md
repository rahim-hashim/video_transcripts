# 'Tested me more' than war: Veteran says he 'lost everything' in Texas flood
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM)
*  So, Kevin, it's with a mixed bag, I think, that we talk to you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=0.0s)]
*  The feelings here, our hearts go out to you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=5.44s)]
*  But given your commitment to volunteering, helping others in times of incredible hardship, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=7.96s)]
*  what kind of emotions are you going through being on the receiving end of help right now? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=13.24s)]
*  Well, once you're a Marine, you're always a Marine. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=18.04s)]
*  So there's no former Marines. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=21.88s)]
*  I'm a retired gunnery sergeant from the United States Marine Corps. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  I served this country for 20 years. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=27.52s)]
*  And yeah, so we're just going through the punches right now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=31.72s)]
*  It is what it is. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=37.76s)]
*  We can't change the past. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=39.44s)]
*  We've accepted what has happened. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=42.28s)]
*  You know, we lost everything. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=45.56s)]
*  We lost our vehicles, our home. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=46.96s)]
*  We're just, you know, we're surviving, but we're thriving. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=51.4s)]
*  The community has come together so much. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=57.68s)]
*  You cannot go a block without getting free food here in Kirkland. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=60.64s)]
*  There's water. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=67.48s)]
*  There is anything you can think of. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=68.44s)]
*  This is Texas. I'm a Texan. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=70.72s)]
*  I was born and raised in Midland, Odessa. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=72.4s)]
*  And I just, you know, we went through quite an ordeal. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=75.48s)]
*  But, you know, we're just we're making it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=82.56s)]
*  I appreciate the positivity so much. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=86.16s)]
*  And I don't know that everyone's able to share that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  And it may come to your training. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=92.0s)]
*  I want to ask you about that, because this harrowing night one week ago, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=93.6s)]
*  you have floodwaters, as we understand, rushing into your home. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  You and your fiancee end up clinging to a beam for a couple of hours. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=101.36s)]
*  You saw trucks floating by propane tanks exploding. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=105.83999999999999s)]
*  And you say, quote, I've been to war. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=109.24s)]
*  This tested me more. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  Was it your marine training, your experience responding to disastrous events [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=113.84s)]
*  that that literally saved both of you? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=118.84s)]
*  Was it instinct kicking in over fear? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=121.36s)]
*  Great question. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  So, yes, it was a bit of everything. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  My fiance, she, you know, she's the one that busts the window out. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=132.28s)]
*  We gots to go. I'm like, OK, let's go. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=137.28s)]
*  Put a pillow over the window. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=140.56s)]
*  We've got to be smart about these things because you get cut up. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=142.04s)]
*  And we, you know, we clung to the window or to that, not to the window, I'm sorry, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=145.52s)]
*  to the support beam. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=149.72s)]
*  But you, once you start to lose your cool, that's when things happen. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=152.36s)]
*  That's when bad things happen, unfortunately. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=160.24s)]
*  Yes, marine training, I've been in combat and just everything. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=163.0s)]
*  You know, I've had a lot of water survival training in the Marine Corps. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=168.84s)]
*  So, you know, I've already got a plan B. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  We're holding on to the beams. Right. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  And we have a. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=177.72s)]
*  An emergency, what was it, an emergency vehicle, an emergency vehicle [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=181.88000000000002s)]
*  that had smashed in the first pillars and had taken it out. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=186.24s)]
*  So we're working a plan B. Right. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=191.08s)]
*  You know, if it keeps coming and smashing them down, we're [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  this is what this is what we're going to do. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=198.72s)]
*  Breath control, don't freak out. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=202.72s)]
*  I've got my neighbors to the right of us that are out there [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=204.64s)]
*  playing and, yeah, they're scared. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=208.76s)]
*  I'm just trying to keep everyone motivated. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=210.36s)]
*  You know, yeah, it's going to be OK. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=212.12s)]
*  It's going to be OK. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=217.4s)]
*  And if this happens, you just go with the flow. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=219.16s)]
*  Don't try and fight the current. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=222.56s)]
*  You're going to grab on to something. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=224.16s)]
*  There's there's going to be Kevin. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  And I just want to say the president is wheels up there on Air Force One. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=228.44s)]
*  So he's heading your way. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  She'll be there shortly. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  But I'm just curious, is there will be reflection on all this? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=233.44s)]
*  And we've heard a lot of different timelines from people about alerts, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=237.56s)]
*  warnings that they got some joke at the wake at 330. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=241.32s)]
*  I think the mayor wasn't alerted until a call at 530. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=244.56s)]
*  Do you remember getting an alert about what time it was? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=247.48s)]
*  We had alerts throughout the night. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  I think two o'clock was the first one. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=254.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, there were a couple of separate ones, but. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=259.16s)]
*  You know. A lot of people were fortunate enough to be up [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=263.76s)]
*  at the time we were at. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=268.44s)]
*  All right, so my fiance goes to work at six. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=269.96s)]
*  We were up at four thirty. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=272.72s)]
*  We really didn't get much sleep that night because the thunder and the lightning. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=274.44s)]
*  And it was just it was a pretty severe. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=278.76s)]
*  You know, storm. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=282.48s)]
*  About four thirty, four thirty five. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=285.36s)]
*  I'm looking out there and there's, you know, there's some water coming at the park, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=287.24s)]
*  you know, where I live and did a parking lot area. Yeah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=290.16s)]
*  By four forty five, it was already just flowing through the door. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=294.24s)]
*  That is extraordinary. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=300.24s)]
*  You're you're saying you woke up at four thirty, really? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=301.56s)]
*  That's when you would wake up after a sleepless night by four forty five. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=304.36s)]
*  That is how quickly things took over for you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, listening to your story, Kevin Jones, I [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=311.76000000000005s)]
*  I think it's amazing that you and your fiance are still alive. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=315.12s)]
*  We're very glad for that and appreciate your time with us and sharing your story. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=318.16s)]
*  Do take care of yourself. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=323.44000000000005s)]
*  We want to let everyone know as well that if they want to learn about your work [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZ4oSJQ3pM&t=324.96000000000004s)]
