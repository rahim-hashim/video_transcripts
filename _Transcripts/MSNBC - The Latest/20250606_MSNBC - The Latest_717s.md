# Musk is ‘national security threat of the highest order’: Ex-GOP strategist reacts to feud
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA)
*  There has never been a standoff. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=0.0s)]
*  View, divorce, implosion, pick your word, quite like this. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=2.32s)]
*  Billionaire versus billionaire. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Social media giant versus social media giant. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=8.72s)]
*  Social media owner versus owner. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Both of them experts, commanding attention on and offline. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=14.64s)]
*  An opinion writer for the Washington Post [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=18.92s)]
*  says the Donald Trump-Elon Musk bromance [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=21.04s)]
*  was always doomed to fail. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Quote, no relationship has room for more than one narcissist. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=25.36s)]
*  This fact alone was probably terminal [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=29.720000000000002s)]
*  for the Trump-Musk marriage, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=31.92s)]
*  but it did not help that the two billionaires [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=33.72s)]
*  are so much alike. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=35.6s)]
*  Effective teams have complementary traits, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=36.96s)]
*  not redundant ones. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=39.6s)]
*  While Trump and Musk both specialize [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=41.68s)]
*  in bellicose social media, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=43.36s)]
*  share flitting attention spans [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=44.800000000000004s)]
*  and are standouts at shamelessness. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=47.56s)]
*  But David Von Drilly, what do you really think? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=50.28s)]
*  Well, as a soap opera, this has been a ratings bonanza, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=52.6s)]
*  but the real world implications are enormous. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=55.8s)]
*  What kind of influence could Elon Musk wield politically, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=59.48s)]
*  especially with the midterms not as far off as we may think, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=63.0s)]
*  and also in the tech world, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=66.28s)]
*  which is now a powerhouse in the donor game? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  NBC's Ryan Nobles joins us with his Capitol Hill reporting. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=70.92s)]
*  I also wanna bring in senior advisor to the Lincoln Project, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=74.32s)]
*  Stuart Stevens, and here with me [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=77.16s)]
*  is Wired seniors writer, Jack LaHutte. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=78.8s)]
*  Okay, so Jake, the internet went nuts, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=81.6s)]
*  group chats exploded, everywhere I went, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=86.24s)]
*  I overheard people talking about it, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=88.56s)]
*  including the grocery store. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  Everyone's talking about this feud, right? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  If Musk is now out of that inner circle in the White House, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=95.08s)]
*  is he open for political business elsewhere? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=99.8s)]
*  Well, that is a hot topic among my sources right now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  I think the future of America PAC, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=104.68s)]
*  if we just limit it to that, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  with his outside spending is pretty unclear. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=107.88s)]
*  It right now only has about $2.2-ish million in cash on hand, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  and I think the speculation and the concern is, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=114.44s)]
*  frankly, Elon could cause a lot more problems [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=117.52s)]
*  for incumbent members of Congress, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=119.52s)]
*  and then it gets trickier with who has the leverage [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=121.64s)]
*  between Elon and Trump, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=124.08s)]
*  but if you're just your rank-and-file Republican right now [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  looking at re-elections in 2026, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=127.32s)]
*  I don't think you love the prospect of America PAC [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=129.4s)]
*  bombarding you with ads, even if the Trump endorsement [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=131.92s)]
*  and the Trump alignment isn't part of that equation. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=134.24s)]
*  And we know big tech leaders through billions [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=136.4s)]
*  behind Trump in the last election cycle, other candidates. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=140.0s)]
*  How much weight does Elon Musk's voice carry there now? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=144.56s)]
*  Well, I think it's getting trickier, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=148.52s)]
*  and this is actually indicative of one, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=150.24s)]
*  I would say, a power vacuum that's gonna be brewing [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  going into 2028, and then some slight fissures [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  and splintering going on with the Silicon Valley wing [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=158.8s)]
*  and the GOP, where a lot of these folks [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  who got on the Trump train, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=162.96s)]
*  most of whom were after the assassination, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=163.96s)]
*  and after, sorry, the assassination attempt, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=165.8s)]
*  and after Elon Musk endorsed Trump on the day of, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  they had maybe some limited areas of agreement with Trump, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  usually crypto or various forms of deregulation. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=175.32s)]
*  So now those folks are being forced [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=177.12s)]
*  to effectively pick sides, and that is true [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  both for members of Congress and also for tech executives [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=182.2s)]
*  and billionaires in Silicon Valley. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  So, Ryan, let's remember what blew all this up, right? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=187.68s)]
*  Trump's mega bill, that Musk then called [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=190.16s)]
*  the disgusting abomination, I think it was like [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=192.28s)]
*  just three or four days ago, feels like a year ago. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=194.32s)]
*  What's the sense on the Hill right now [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=197.04s)]
*  after Musk threatened to challenge anyone [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=198.88s)]
*  who votes for this bill? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=201.64s)]
*  Are members of Congress worried? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=202.84s)]
*  I wouldn't say they're worried today, Chris, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=205.4s)]
*  and I think that when they're making [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  a short-term calculation, their short-term calculation [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=210.28s)]
*  is that they need to be with Donald Trump right now, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=213.68s)]
*  especially given the fact that Elon Musk [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=215.8s)]
*  tends to be all over the map, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=218.24s)]
*  especially when it comes to his politics, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  and there's no telling that the kind of vacuum [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=221.2s)]
*  that he finds himself in today [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  will be the same one that he's in [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=225.96s)]
*  as we get closer to these 2026 midterms. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=227.6s)]
*  I think they're very mindful of the fact [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  that he could get involved in some of these primaries, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=231.44s)]
*  but they just need to get over this hill [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=234.12s)]
*  that's in front of them right now, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=235.84s)]
*  and this is that big bill that they need to pass [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=237.52s)]
*  that really will largely be the foundation [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=240.32s)]
*  of the Trump legacy and the Trump administration [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  going forward. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=246.4s)]
*  Listen to how Speaker Mike Johnson [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=247.24s)]
*  explained the dynamics that he and his conference [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=249.0s)]
*  find themselves in. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=252.12s)]
*  Elon was a big contributor in the last election, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=255.12s)]
*  but this was a whole team effort. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=257.12s)]
*  President Trump is the most consequential political figure [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=259.35999999999996s)]
*  of his generation, of modern American history. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=263.32s)]
*  He is the one responsible for that, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=267.2s)]
*  but we all worked hard. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  We delivered the House majority. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  I traveled the country nonstop. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=271.44s)]
*  I did over 360 campaign events in 250 cities and 40 states, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=273.08s)]
*  and I logged enough miles last year [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=276.84s)]
*  that circle the globe five and a half times. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=278.67999999999995s)]
*  I contributed to it as well. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  All of our House Republicans did. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=282.12s)]
*  So the message there from Mike Johnson [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=285.12s)]
*  is that Elon Musk alone is not enough to derail [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  the Republican hopes of holding on [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=289.52000000000004s)]
*  to the House of Representatives and the Senate [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=292.20000000000005s)]
*  for that matter, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  but when you take a look at the margins, Chris, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  and it's only three seats right now, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  and under the current environment [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  that Republicans find themselves in, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  there is very little room for error. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=301.8s)]
*  So if Elon Musk decides to get involved in just four or five, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=304.32s)]
*  maybe 10 different House races [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=307.64000000000004s)]
*  where he provides a lot of grief [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=309.48s)]
*  for incumbent House Republicans, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=312.36s)]
*  that could be the difference [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=314.32s)]
*  between winning or losing the majority [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=315.16s)]
*  in the 2026 elections. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=317.56s)]
*  Right now though, it's just too difficult to predict. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=319.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so where some Republicans maybe see a threat, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=321.32000000000005s)]
*  Democrats do sense an opening. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=324.48s)]
*  Politico puts it this way. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=326.16s)]
*  Democrats eye a villain to ally arc for Elon Musk. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  What would that even look like, and would voters buy it? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  No, I don't think anybody wants to be near Elon Musk. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, 48 hours ago, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  he was one of the most toxic figures in American life. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=341.88s)]
*  He had some support among MAGA and Trump diehards. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=346.0s)]
*  He's lost that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=348.4s)]
*  I mean, can we just step back and think about [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=350.0s)]
*  what we've seen, what Elon Musk is really like, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  and what Donald Trump is really like? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=356.8s)]
*  Elon Musk was basically accusing Donald Trump [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=358.84s)]
*  of being a pedophile. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=361.76s)]
*  I mean, and these are the people [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=363.47999999999996s)]
*  that are making these key decisions about America's future. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=365.96s)]
*  I mean, it's just absolutely shocking [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=369.2s)]
*  and depressing and revealing [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  when they kind of rip off the mask. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=373.68s)]
*  You have this guy who, by Wall Street Journal, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=375.76s)]
*  New York Times reported heavy drug use. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=378.92s)]
*  A guy who Wired Magazine reported [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=381.56s)]
*  may very well have lied about his status [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=384.12s)]
*  when he applied for citizenship, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  in which case it would be grounds [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=388.68s)]
*  for his citizenship being revoked and deported. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=390.52s)]
*  It's just a completely dark chapter. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=394.16s)]
*  And what you look at- [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=397.44s)]
*  Well, it's a dark chapter, Stuart, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=398.68s)]
*  but the fact of the matter is [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  one got elected president of the United States, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=402.28s)]
*  and one, in spite of everything you just talked about, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=404.96s)]
*  is the richest man in the world. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=407.79999999999995s)]
*  So where does that leave things? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=410.0s)]
*  Well, I think it makes you question the value [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=412.76s)]
*  of being the richest man in the world. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=414.76s)]
*  Is that the only value? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=416.11999999999995s)]
*  What other sort of human qualities, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=417.67999999999995s)]
*  what sense of decency, of compassion, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  of basic ability to function as an adult? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=422.4s)]
*  You know, I think if we become a society [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=429.35999999999996s)]
*  where we elevate someone to say, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=431.64s)]
*  okay, you've made more money than anybody else, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  therefore we want you to run the country, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  I think that's a really bad place for this society to be. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=438.08s)]
*  And there's always been wealthy people involved [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=442.68s)]
*  in American politics, but never like this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=444.52s)]
*  And look, I think Donald Trump won [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=447.2s)]
*  because he had an incumbent president with 40% favorables [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=449.28s)]
*  in the history of America, modern politics, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=454.56s)]
*  no incumbent party's ever gotten [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=457.4s)]
*  more than two points higher than that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=459.32s)]
*  The right track of the country was at 27, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=461.32s)]
*  no incumbent parties ever won with it being under 45. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=464.04s)]
*  And I don't think that should be confused [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=467.68s)]
*  with an endorsement of Trumpism. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=469.32s)]
*  If I was Democrats here, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=471.48s)]
*  I would just raise utter holy hell about this. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=473.48s)]
*  Clearly, we should take steps to nationalize [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=476.56s)]
*  under the Defense Procurement Act, Starlink, and SpaceX. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=479.6s)]
*  I mean, this guy is a national security threat [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=483.71999999999997s)]
*  of the highest order. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=487.28s)]
*  And Democrats should feast on this [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=488.84s)]
*  and take it very seriously because it is very serious. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=490.6s)]
*  Well, the question is whether or not [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=493.88s)]
*  they can use that effectively, right, Jake? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=495.68s)]
*  Because there's going to be ads that feature Elon Musk. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=498.16s)]
*  I don't think anybody's doubting that. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=500.8s)]
*  But I wonder, big picture, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=502.24s)]
*  he's publicly mused about starting a third party. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=504.04s)]
*  He put a ton of money into [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=508.12s)]
*  the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, cheese hat and all. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=509.44s)]
*  Kennedy back still lost. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=513.8000000000001s)]
*  So are we just all waiting to see [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=516.08s)]
*  what's going to happen next [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=519.92s)]
*  and what the real influence of Elon Musk is? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=521.28s)]
*  Or are we kidding ourselves? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=523.68s)]
*  Anybody with that much money has influence. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=525.4799999999999s)]
*  Well, sure. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=529.0799999999999s)]
*  I would counter that though with like, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=530.04s)]
*  hey, if Elon wants to light a bunch of money on fire [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=531.9599999999999s)]
*  and have a third party, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=534.4s)]
*  they'll get a couple percent of the vote every year. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=535.36s)]
*  He can do it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=537.64s)]
*  Nothing stopping him from doing it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=538.8s)]
*  But there's an argument to be made that in a close race, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=539.88s)]
*  3% of the vote could switch an election. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=542.4799999999999s)]
*  This is where I think that kind of slapdash coalition, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=545.4s)]
*  the Trump campaign, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  rather impressively put together [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=549.76s)]
*  with the Elon Silicon Valley component, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=551.04s)]
*  the RFK Jr. sort of new age wellness, that component. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=553.2s)]
*  I think we're gonna start to see this fall apart [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=557.48s)]
*  thread by thread going into 2028. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=559.4s)]
*  And that's where it's gonna come down to people [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=561.4s)]
*  like JD Vance, Marco Rubio, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=562.72s)]
*  who else is gonna be eyeing that Republican primary electorate [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=564.52s)]
*  and who might start dabbling with a third party run. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=567.28s)]
*  I know that Andrew Yang just had to hop on [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=569.64s)]
*  that train yesterday. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=573.28s)]
*  And we have Stuart here agreeing with Steve Bannon [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=574.36s)]
*  about nationalizing. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=577.24s)]
*  Deportation. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=578.76s)]
*  SpaceX, so look where we are. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=579.6s)]
*  Well, wasn't it Steve Bannon too, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=581.04s)]
*  correct me if I'm wrong here, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=583.08s)]
*  who suggested maybe that President Trump [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=584.16s)]
*  should consider deporting Elon Musk. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=586.48s)]
*  All right, so Stuart, I do wonder [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=590.2s)]
*  what folks outside of the US think about all this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=594.32s)]
*  They have a stake in this too, a pretty significant one. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=597.04s)]
*  Elon Musk was everywhere with Trump. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=600.84s)]
*  He was in Saudi Arabia. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=603.1800000000001s)]
*  They saw him at the cabinet meetings. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=604.92s)]
*  They saw him numerous times in the Oval Office. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=606.28s)]
*  They heard that he was overnighting in the Lincoln bedroom. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=608.92s)]
*  What's the rest of the world to make of this [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=611.92s)]
*  and our standing in the world? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=614.4s)]
*  Yeah, well, it hurts it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=616.88s)]
*  I mean, you see someone who has terrible judgment, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=618.12s)]
*  that's Elon Musk and a person who took him inside [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=620.3199999999999s)]
*  the beating heart of the American government, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=623.64s)]
*  and that's Donald Trump. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=626.22s)]
*  So it's just one more example of why Donald Trump [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=628.0s)]
*  is so unfit to be president. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=631.52s)]
*  And why this coalition that was put together [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=633.3199999999999s)]
*  is unsustainable. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=636.4s)]
*  But look, what happened here [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=638.1999999999999s)]
*  to being a shiny city on a hill? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=640.76s)]
*  You have one guy accusing the other [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=643.1999999999999s)]
*  of being in the Epstein files. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=646.6s)]
*  You have another that says that he's gone crazy. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=648.04s)]
*  This is someone who both of them [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=650.4399999999999s)]
*  were just praising each other days before. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=652.3199999999999s)]
*  It's, do you really feel good [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=656.56s)]
*  that one of them has all your data in his pocket [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U98fFIkMA&t=658.6s)]
