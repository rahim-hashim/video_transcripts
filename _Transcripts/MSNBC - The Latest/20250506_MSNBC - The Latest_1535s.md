# Lawrence: Canada's PM humiliated Trump today, but not as much as Trump humiliated himself
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI)
*  Well, no one is capable of humiliating Donald Trump as perfectly as Donald Trump humiliates [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=10.36s)]
*  And Donald Trump did that again today. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=11.36s)]
*  But he wasn't the only one. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump was also humiliated once again today in the Oval Office by the top elected [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  official of another country, in this case Canada. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=19.6s)]
*  And we've seen a steady stream of that sort of humiliation of Donald Trump in the Oval [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=22.48s)]
*  Office this year, beginning with the president of France. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=26.68s)]
*  The Canadian prime minister both humbled and humiliated Donald Trump at the same time, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  without Donald Trump having the slightest idea it was happening, because Donald Trump [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  is a 78-year-old man. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=42.32s)]
*  Clearly, off his game is the polite way of putting it, and maybe in significant neurological [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  decline and physical exhaustion at this point. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=53.16s)]
*  When you watch Donald Trump on video and Sundays meet the press saying, I don't know, to Kristen [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=56.959999999999994s)]
*  Welker's very simple question, don't you need to uphold the Constitution of the United [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=66.16s)]
*  States as president, you were watching what appears to be an exhausted hulk of a man with [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=70.6s)]
*  his inexplicable confection of hair slightly out of place for the very first time, and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=79.02s)]
*  some perspiration beginning to shine through his makeup, who just right there on TV gave [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=85.3s)]
*  up, he just gave up in the middle of that interview, saying, I don't know. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=93.69999999999999s)]
*  When is the last time you heard Donald Trump say, I don't know? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=101.22s)]
*  That is one thing that the fast-talking salesman never says, even when he doesn't know, which [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=104.7s)]
*  is most of the time. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=110.98s)]
*  Donald Trump is the most ignorant person in American history to ever be asked questions [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=111.98s)]
*  about politics or government, and the true answer to more than 90% of those questions [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=115.88s)]
*  would always be, I don't know, but Donald Trump can never admit that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=120.98s)]
*  He throws collections of words at questions that have no relationship to the question, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=125.42s)]
*  just to avoid saying, I don't know. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=130.3s)]
*  That's the thing he really doesn't want to say, but on Sunday, with his big frame curled [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=133.98s)]
*  into a weary ball on the edge of his chair, Donald Trump gave up and just said, I don't [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=139.29999999999998s)]
*  know. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=146.14s)]
*  He was in effect admitting that he doesn't remember the words of his oath of office in [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=147.62s)]
*  which he solemnly swore to defend the Constitution of the United States. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  Imagine how beaten down he had to be on the 104th day of his second presidency to humiliate [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=157.78s)]
*  himself by saying, I don't know. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=165.94s)]
*  There's a lot more at stake for the country in Donald Trump's ignorance expressed in the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  answer to that question, of course, but the I don't know was another way of Donald Trump [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=177.14s)]
*  saying, I give up. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=181.82s)]
*  I just can't sling this stuff anymore. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=182.82s)]
*  Donald Trump is tonight a total loser based on his own measure of winning. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=186.98000000000002s)]
*  It has been a long time since Donald Trump promised his followers that they would get [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=197.42000000000002s)]
*  tired of winning. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=200.94s)]
*  He hasn't told them that this year, not this tariff year, not this trade war year. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=202.10000000000002s)]
*  Instead, he's told them how many pencils they can buy or how many dolls they can buy for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=206.5s)]
*  But he has not told anyone that they're going to get tired of winning. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump made the country a promise. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=218.01999999999998s)]
*  It was a promise that the country did not ask for, and it has become, as they say in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=221.17999999999998s)]
*  soccer, an own goal for Donald Trump. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=226.26s)]
*  Donald Trump promised 90 deals in 90 days after he crashed the stock market by starting [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=231.14s)]
*  a worldwide trade war, which Donald Trump is very much losing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=237.74s)]
*  According to his own standard, Donald Trump promised 90 deals in 90 days 25 days ago. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=242.94s)]
*  So we're going to run 90 deals in 90 days is possible. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=254.10000000000002s)]
*  The boss is going to be the chief negotiator. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  The boss is going to be the chief negotiator. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=263.62s)]
*  Wow, that's great. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=265.54s)]
*  So that's the first time in history that the president of the United States would be the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=267.38s)]
*  chief negotiator of any trade deal. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=270.88s)]
*  And as of tonight, the chief negotiator, Donald Trump, is showing the world what the art of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=273.21999999999997s)]
*  no deals looks like. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=278.46s)]
*  Donald Trump has exactly zero deals in 25 days. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=281.5s)]
*  I have a deal. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=290.94s)]
*  Done, done, done, done. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=292.34s)]
*  But I need to wait for their prime minister and their parliament to give its approval, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=294.42s)]
*  which I expect shortly. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=298.94s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you what country. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=299.94s)]
*  He was lying, of course, and I told you that night that he said that, that the most incompetent [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=302.90000000000003s)]
*  commerce secretary in history had no deal. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=308.62s)]
*  None. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=312.82s)]
*  That was seven days ago. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=313.82s)]
*  And Howard Lutnick has not dared to say that again, has not dared to say again that he [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=316.1s)]
*  has that deal because he has no deal. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=320.94s)]
*  Donald Trump has not negotiated a single deal, which means in his own terms, he is the loser [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=324.34s)]
*  in every one of the 25 deals he is supposed to have negotiated as of tonight. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=331.02s)]
*  He has lost 25 times because he has gotten absolutely nothing in those 25 days. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=338.7s)]
*  But that hasn't prevented Donald Trump from lying about it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=346.3s)]
*  Here's Donald Trump two weeks ago in an interview with Time magazine. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=349.9s)]
*  Question, there's zero deals so far. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=354.34s)]
*  Why is that, Trump? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=357.34s)]
*  No, there's many deals. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=358.58s)]
*  Question, where are they? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=359.82s)]
*  When are they going to be announced? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=361.85999999999996s)]
*  Trump, you have to understand, I'm dealing with all the companies, very friendly countries. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=363.09999999999997s)]
*  We're meeting with China. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=368.85999999999996s)]
*  We're doing fine with everybody, but ultimately, I've made all the deals. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=370.62s)]
*  That was a lie. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=379.22s)]
*  Zero deals. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=381.46000000000004s)]
*  The art of no deals is to simply lie about mythical deals. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=383.22s)]
*  Someone must have told the Treasury Secretary that it is against the law to lie to Congress [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=390.70000000000005s)]
*  because this is what Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary told a House committee today. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=396.70000000000005s)]
*  China, we have not engaged in negotiations with as of yet. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=406.22s)]
*  Donald Trump said two weeks ago that he, Donald Trump, was meeting with China. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=411.66s)]
*  We are meeting with China. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=417.02000000000004s)]
*  Those were his exact words. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=419.02000000000004s)]
*  The Treasury Secretary today said, no, that's not true at all. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=420.42s)]
*  Not one word has been spoken to China. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  None of us are meeting with China. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=426.06s)]
*  President wasn't telling the truth. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=427.74s)]
*  That's what the Treasury Secretary told Congress. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=428.94000000000005s)]
*  There's Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary humiliating Donald Trump today and knowing [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=432.62s)]
*  he can get away with it because he has seen Donald Trump up close this year. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=437.46000000000004s)]
*  He probably knows that the Donald Trump, who is now mired in the 25th day of the art of [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=442.78000000000003s)]
*  no deals, is not spending his day watching the Treasury Secretary testify about Donald [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=449.02000000000004s)]
*  Trump to a House committee. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=455.74s)]
*  No. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=458.46000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump spent some of his day with the electorally victorious new Prime Minister [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=459.90000000000003s)]
*  of Canada who won an election that was fueled by Canadian voter intense opposition, is the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=466.1s)]
*  kindest word to put on it, opposition to Donald Trump, the very first president of the United [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=474.66s)]
*  States, to actually offer himself as a candidate for Canadians to vote for on election day [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=480.66s)]
*  in a social media burst of Trumpian constitutional dementia. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=490.26s)]
*  You're about to see the video of Donald Trump achieving the art of no deals once again today [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=497.9s)]
*  in his utterly demented attempt, this time on TV, to make Canada the 51st state. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=504.85999999999996s)]
*  What you are about to see is the President of the United States, who sounds like he is [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=514.8199999999999s)]
*  out of his mind sitting beside a real head of state who obviously, though he must have [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=519.86s)]
*  expected it, still can't really believe what he's hearing in the Oval Office. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=526.98s)]
*  And you will watch how the Canadian Prime Minister says absolutely no to Donald Trump, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=534.58s)]
*  to his face, with Donald Trump far too exhausted at this point to try to interrupt the way [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=543.14s)]
*  he did when Ukraine's President Zelensky was sitting beside him in the Oval Office. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=551.9s)]
*  Things have gone very badly for Donald Trump every day since President Zelensky was in [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=557.58s)]
*  the Oval Office. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=561.34s)]
*  And Donald Trump had no fight in him today when the very polite Canadian beside him talked [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=563.18s)]
*  rings around Donald Trump, like a ringmaster in a circus with a trained animal threw in [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=570.58s)]
*  some magic words that sounded flattering enough to Donald Trump so that Donald Trump actually, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=576.94s)]
*  and you'll see this, ends up nodding and agreeing with the man who is humiliating him and defeating [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=584.1s)]
*  him right there in the room on TV. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=593.0400000000001s)]
*  The first thing you will hear Donald Trump say after the Canadian Prime Minister has [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=596.98s)]
*  humiliated him is, that's true. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=602.22s)]
*  That's what Trump says. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=606.94s)]
*  No president has ever lost more in one conversation in the Oval Office than Donald Trump lost [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=609.1s)]
*  in these 90 seconds. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=621.3000000000001s)]
*  I'm a very artistic person, but when I looked at that beauty, I said that's the way it was [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=624.9s)]
*  meant to be. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=629.54s)]
*  But you know, I do feel it's much better for Canada, but we're not going to be discussing [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=630.62s)]
*  that unless somebody wants to discuss it. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=638.02s)]
*  I think that there are tremendous benefits to the Canadian citizens, tremendously lower [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=640.1s)]
*  taxes, free military, which honestly we give you essentially anyway because we're protecting [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=645.42s)]
*  Canada if you have had a problem. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=650.6800000000001s)]
*  But I think it would really be a wonderful marriage because it's two places that get [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=653.1s)]
*  along very well. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=659.9s)]
*  They like each other a lot. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=660.9s)]
*  Well, if I may, as you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=663.0600000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=670.0600000000001s)]
*  We're sitting in one right now, Buckingham Palace that you visited as well. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=671.0600000000001s)]
*  And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign last several months, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=675.5400000000001s)]
*  it's not for sale, it won't be for sale ever. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=681.9s)]
*  But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=685.02s)]
*  We have done that in the past. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=689.98s)]
*  And part of that, as the president just said, is with respect to our own security. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=691.42s)]
*  And my government is committed for a step change in our investment in Canadian security [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=697.22s)]
*  and our partnership. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=702.76s)]
*  And I'll say this as well, that the president has revitalized international security, revitalized [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=703.76s)]
*  and us playing our full weight in NATO. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=711.66s)]
*  Kind of sad. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=715.98s)]
*  The old guy slumped forward in his bad posture, the Canadian sitting up, the Canadian talking [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=716.98s)]
*  rings around him, Prime Minister Mark Carney, you can see, try thinking of mind racing while [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=725.5s)]
*  Donald Trump's saying these insane things. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=733.26s)]
*  And then finally, when the prime minister gets his shot, could not be more calm. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=735.46s)]
*  And Donald Trump doesn't understand, doesn't even understand what's happening on the Canadian [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=741.46s)]
*  side of that conversation. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=746.5400000000001s)]
*  The other deal Donald Trump failed to make right there in that room on TV was a trade [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=748.14s)]
*  deal with Canada, which Donald Trump has been promising all year. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=755.74s)]
*  Now to make a new trade deal with Canada, Donald Trump will have to legally amend through [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=760.94s)]
*  a vote in Congress the trade deal that he already has with Canada that his administration [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=767.3800000000001s)]
*  negotiated in the first Trump presidency. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=775.4200000000001s)]
*  That was the rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Donald Trump signed [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=778.74s)]
*  into law in 2018. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=782.98s)]
*  That agreement, which Donald Trump signed into law, makes it legally impossible for [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=785.5s)]
*  Donald Trump to reach a trade agreement with Canada without also reaching a trade agreement [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=789.92s)]
*  with Mexico at the same time. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=795.0s)]
*  Are you optimistic? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=800.72s)]
*  Can we make a deal with Canada? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=801.84s)]
*  I think it's really complex. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=803.6s)]
*  I think this is really complex because they have been basically feeding off of us for [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=804.6s)]
*  decades upon decades upon decades. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=809.68s)]
*  Wrong. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=813.36s)]
*  But what could possibly be the problem? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=815.88s)]
*  The boss is in the room with the boss of Canada. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=819.24s)]
*  Why couldn't the boss make a deal today? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=822.64s)]
*  The Lutnicks in the Trump administration never said it's very complex. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=826.8s)]
*  When they promised 90 deals in 90 days, Donald Trump is now refusing to do joint press conferences, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=832.52s)]
*  the standard thing, with visiting heads of state because he does seem to have figured [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=837.92s)]
*  out exactly how much humiliation would be hate upon him in such a press conference. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=843.52s)]
*  Prime Minister Mark Carney had a few things to say, though, after teaching Donald Trump [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=852.1999999999999s)]
*  a few lessons in the Oval Office. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=858.36s)]
*  I was watching your face through the meeting in the Oval Office, and I wondered what was [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=862.6s)]
*  going through your mind when the president talked about re-erasing the artificial border [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=867.56s)]
*  and how he criticized your predecessor and Madame Freeland. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=872.36s)]
*  Well, thank you, I guess, for your question. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=875.92s)]
*  I'm glad that you couldn't tell what was going through my mind as that was going through. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=881.16s)]
*  With respect to the first point, the president has made known his wish about that issue for [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=887.8399999999999s)]
*  some time. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=899.24s)]
*  I've been careful always to distinguish between wish and reality. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=900.92s)]
*  I was clear there in the Oval Office, as I've been clear throughout, on behalf of Canadians, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=904.84s)]
*  that this is never going to happen. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=910.52s)]
*  Canada's not for sale, it never will be for sale. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=912.32s)]
*  Some things, as I said in the room, some things are never for sale, and he agreed with that. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=915.28s)]
*  So I distinguish between the two. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=921.5600000000001s)]
*  Have you asked the president to stop calling Canada the 51st state? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=924.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=928.84s)]
*  Today. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=930.44s)]
*  What was his answer? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=931.44s)]
*  Well, look, I don't know. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=932.44s)]
*  He's the president, he's his own person. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=934.44s)]
*  I would go back to showing the difference between a wish and a reality. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=937.84s)]
*  We're very clear. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=943.52s)]
*  I've been very clear publicly, consistently. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=944.52s)]
*  I've been very clear in private. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=946.64s)]
*  It was clear again in the Oval Office. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=947.9200000000001s)]
*  I would be clear throughout. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=950.0400000000001s)]
*  The president, he understands that we're having a negotiation between sovereign nations [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=953.08s)]
*  and that we will only pursue and accept a deal that's in the best interests of Canada, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=960.08s)]
*  not just in the short term, but in the medium and long term for Canada. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=967.6s)]
*  Which country do you think is prouder today of their highest ranking elected official? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=972.0400000000001s)]
*  Canada or the United States? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=978.1600000000001s)]
*  That view you just saw, by the way, is the view from the Canadian Embassy, which is one [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=982.24s)]
*  of the largest, if not the largest, embassy buildings in Washington. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=988.1999999999999s)]
*  And it is the closest embassy to the capital of the United States, a deliberate choice [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=994.0799999999999s)]
*  by Canada and the United States to show how close these two governments are supposed to [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1001.8s)]
*  be and always have been until Donald Trump insanely decided to cause trouble with the [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1009.88s)]
*  strongest ally the United States of America has ever had. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1022.64s)]
*  Donald Trump always lied about tariffs during the presidential campaign. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1025.24s)]
*  He always told the lie that China would pay the Trump tariffs. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1029.2s)]
*  Other countries would pay the Trump tariffs. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1035.32s)]
*  Now Donald Trump is telling Americans that tariffs will make them unable to afford the [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1038.16s)]
*  number of toys they might want to buy for their children for Christmas because we pay [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1042.72s)]
*  the tariffs. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1048.4s)]
*  Donald Trump's teaching everyone that. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1049.4s)]
*  Donald Trump is telling his followers that they won't be able to afford the number of [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1050.68s)]
*  pencils they might want to buy. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1055.12s)]
*  That's how much they're going to have to pay for the Trump tariffs. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1058.12s)]
*  Donald Trump has now made it very clear who pays the Trump tariffs. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1061.4s)]
*  He's actually made it clearer than anyone else who's ever attempted to make it clear [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1066.16s)]
*  by talking about dolls and pencils and making it really simple and telling people it's going [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1070.3200000000002s)]
*  to cost you. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1078.1200000000001s)]
*  It's going to cost us. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1079.5600000000002s)]
*  He's telling people they will be only able to afford five pencils when the Trump tariffs [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1080.8400000000001s)]
*  are in full effect. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1087.3600000000001s)]
*  A pencil costs 25 cents now. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1088.64s)]
*  He thinks you're only going to be able to afford five of them because when you pay those [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1091.56s)]
*  tariffs the price of a pencil is going to be so high. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1096.96s)]
*  What? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1101.6s)]
*  Five bucks? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1102.6s)]
*  What's he talking about? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1103.6s)]
*  And because Donald Trump's dominant characteristic is now and always has been rank stupidity, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1104.6s)]
*  he cannot stop bumping into his own stupidity about his examples of what can be under the [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1111.52s)]
*  Christmas tree because of his tariffs. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1120.28s)]
*  After saying last week that because of his tariffs children will get two dolls instead [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1123.16s)]
*  of 30 dolls. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1127.84s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1128.84s)]
*  Two dolls instead of 30 dolls for Christmas and then this week amending that to three, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1129.84s)]
*  four, or maybe even five dolls when he stupidly talked about Christmas again while meeting [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1134.1200000000001s)]
*  someone in the Oval Office this evening who has nothing to do with Christmas or tariffs. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1144.76s)]
*  He did it again. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1150.52s)]
*  There he was in a meeting with the head of an international soccer organization. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1153.1999999999998s)]
*  No one was there to mention tariffs or Christmas or what you can afford on Christmas because [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1158.8s)]
*  of Donald Trump's tariffs. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1164.32s)]
*  The president who has said the stupidest things ever said in the White House about Christmas [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1165.36s)]
*  or dolls or tariffs stumbled and bumbled his way into saying this about his visitor, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1171.0s)]
*  the soccer guy. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1182.44s)]
*  He's got great enthusiasm and that's one of the reasons that you've had such success over [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1185.68s)]
*  the last number of years that you've been there. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1190.8s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1192.92s)]
*  He's like somebody that just woke up on Christmas morning as a young child and saw those toys [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1193.92s)]
*  under the tree and that enthusiasm really plays very well. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1199.8799999999999s)]
*  I have to say. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1203.52s)]
*  Really? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1205.52s)]
*  How many toys under the tree for him? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1206.52s)]

*  shipments from China which have slowed down and stopped in many cases. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1219.96s)]
*  The Trump tariffs might make it impossible for many American parents who want to have [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1223.56s)]
*  a soccer ball under the tree this Christmas. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1228.04s)]
*  Just might not be able to happen. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1231.76s)]
*  The Trump tariffs might just block those soccer balls from ever arriving in this country because [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1232.84s)]
*  the stores that have to order those soccer balls are not capable of paying a 145 percent [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1238.96s)]
*  tariff for those soccer balls. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1245.84s)]
*  So they might not order them. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1248.12s)]
*  They might not be here in December. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1249.44s)]
*  But there's Donald Trump using the one example to express enthusiasm that he should absolutely [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1252.56s)]
*  stay away from the enthusiasm and joy of the child coming down to that Christmas tree on [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1261.28s)]
*  Christmas morning. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1268.36s)]
*  A Christmas morning where Donald Trump has already told American parents that they will [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1269.36s)]
*  not be able to afford what their children want. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1273.76s)]
*  How weak must his mind be to have allowed himself at the end of another tiring day living [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1277.08s)]
*  under his full responsibility for starting a worldwide trade war that he is losing. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1285.48s)]
*  How weak must he have been mentally and physically to have said he's like somebody that just [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1291.1999999999998s)]
*  woke up on Christmas morning as a young child and saw those toys under the tree. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1297.96s)]
*  He said that. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1303.8799999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump in that idiotic statement invited yet another focus on his choice to be the [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1306.16s)]
*  Scrooge president, which is what Republican political analyst Karl Rove is now calling [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1312.48s)]
*  him, the Scrooge president. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1318.72s)]
*  Donald Trump's example of there being only two dolls under the Christmas tree this year, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1321.3600000000001s)]
*  which earned him the nickname Donny Two Dolls on this program last week, has quickly and [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1327.44s)]
*  vividly taught any Americans who did not already understand it that we are the ones [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1332.48s)]
*  and the only ones who will pay the Trump tariffs. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1340.8s)]
*  Every penny of an American tariff, every penny of a Trump tariff will be paid and can only [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1345.28s)]
*  be paid in the United States by American companies and consumers. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1353.24s)]
*  Every tariff revenue enters the Treasury of the United States only from within the [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1359.68s)]
*  United States. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1366.0800000000002s)]
*  Every Treasury secretary from the first, Alexander Hamilton, onward has known that. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1368.2s)]
*  Every member of Congress has always known that. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1376.22s)]
*  Every member of the Senate, every president always knew that. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1379.5600000000002s)]
*  But today, with Donald Trump's Treasury secretary testifying to Congress, knowing that lying [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1383.88s)]
*  is against the law, he tried desperately to evade a very simple question posed by our [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1388.76s)]
*  first guest tonight. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1394.44s)]
*  Who pays tariffs? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1397.64s)]
*  Who pays tariffs? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1404.16s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1405.16s)]
*  Who pays tariffs? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1406.16s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1407.16s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, please. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1408.16s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1409.16s)]
*  The question is very simply, who pays tariffs, Mr. Chairman? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1410.16s)]
*  I'd like him to answer that question. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1411.52s)]
*  He wants to answer other questions. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1413.28s)]
*  Congressman, if the exporters dislike tariffs so much, why wouldn't they, if I think what [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1416.24s)]
*  you're trying to get me to say- [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1429.1200000000001s)]
*  Did you remember the question? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1430.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure you did. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1431.1200000000001s)]
*  Who pays tariffs? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1432.1200000000001s)]
*  It's a very complicated question. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1433.1200000000001s)]
*  Reclaiming my time. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1436.72s)]
*  People pay tariffs, right? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1437.72s)]
*  Reclaiming my time, Mr. Secretary. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1440.24s)]
*  As a small business owner, and unfortunately, I'd like that time back since you failed to [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1442.92s)]
*  recognize me for 30 seconds. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1448.2s)]
*  So I just recently from one of my suppliers got the tariff surcharge on things. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1450.28s)]
*  In addition to the tariff surcharge, guess what else got raised? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1455.48s)]
*  American-made walnut plaques. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1458.8400000000001s)]
*  That has nothing to do with tariffs, but companies take advantage and do that. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1461.2s)]
*  So right now, we are getting screwed right and left because of the indiscriminate use [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1464.48s)]
*  of tariffs. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1469.44s)]
*  That's the reality for Main Street. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1470.68s)]
*  So I'll ask one more time, who pays tariffs? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1472.64s)]
*  The history would show that it is a complicated mix of who pays the tariffs over various times. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1477.52s)]
*  So that's exactly the problem. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1483.68s)]
*  If you're answering, you are a very educated person, you have a very impressive bio, cannot [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1485.4s)]
*  answer the question who pays tariffs because you won't answer that and you say it's a complicated [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1489.4s)]
*  issue. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1493.5600000000002s)]
*  It's not complicated. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1494.5600000000002s)]
*  Consumers pay Trump's tariff tax. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1496.44s)]
*  That's the reality. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1499.0s)]
*  You just saw a Treasury Secretary flunk an introductory economics course on TV. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvHwupaIgI&t=1501.56s)]
