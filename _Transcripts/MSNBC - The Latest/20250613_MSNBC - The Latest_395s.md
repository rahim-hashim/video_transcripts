# 'Truly terrifying': Hen Mazzig gives update from bomb shelter in Israeli amid Iran strikes
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM)
*  Joining us now by phone we have Israeli writer and senior fellow at the Tel Aviv Institute, Henan Maziz [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=0.0s)]
*  First of all, I want to make sure you're safe and able to speak to us [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=7.08s)]
*  And if if that is the case, could you please tell us what you know [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=9.68s)]
*  If anything about what's going on in your city right now and and how the population is reacting is reacting how you're feeling [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=13.26s)]
*  Yeah, I'm safe I'm speaking to you from a bomb shelter in Tel Aviv a concrete room that is meant to protect civilians like me from [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=21.88s)]
*  dismissal the tax [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=30.08s)]
*  You know, this is the reality we live in the streets of Tel Aviv tonight were quite empty [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=31.4s)]
*  I think everyone were preparing we've heard the sirens. We run rented about shelter [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=36.36s)]
*  Were terrified we heard massive explosions. We heard that there was at least seven people injured [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  Some of the missiles were striking in in the center in Tel Aviv in civilian populations [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=49.28s)]
*  It's really terrifying and exhausting it, you know, it's our life here [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=55.48s)]
*  So I I want to call because I think it's important that people would know what we're dealing with right now [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=59.8s)]
*  And hun we do have a shot [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=66.28s)]
*  Maybe we can put it back up that appears to be a ground perspective and it looks like there is some damage [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=67.92s)]
*  To possibly some apartment buildings [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=73.0s)]
*  It looks like at least something did get through control if we could put that shot from ground level back up [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=75.08s)]
*  So our audience can see what we're talking about [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=79.72s)]
*  That would be very helpful I also want to ask you I know [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=82.12s)]
*  Israel is a very diverse pluralistic society, but we were asking some of our other folks with experience in the region [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=85.88s)]
*  How folks are feeling about possible increased tensions with Iran and a time when you're already [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=91.76s)]
*  Dealing with a conflict in Gaza and an overextended or perhaps not but but a certainly pressed military [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=99.08s)]
*  Do do Israelis have the physical and mental capacity to start another conflict with its neighbor? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm talking to you from a bomb shelter at [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  945 p.m. For us in on Friday night. It's our earliest night [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=119.08000000000001s)]
*  It's it's just it's not something that anyone should be experiencing to run this way for your life for protection [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  and doing it several times and last night being woken up at 3 a.m. With [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=129.4s)]
*  Larts on this war beginning. It's not something we want. It's definitely not something we were asking for [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=134.56s)]
*  We didn't ask for the war and I think that's the spirit in Israel today. We don't want to see this war [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=139.72s)]
*  But we understand the need and we are afraid from the statements that is some of the public in Iran has made [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=145.12s)]
*  about erasing us and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=152.84s)]
*  removing us from [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=155.24s)]
*  from existence so [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=156.52s)]
*  My hope is I think the most important thing is that the people of Iran that hear me [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=158.28s)]
*  Know that we see them that we don't want to have this war that we know this regime doesn't speak to them [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=162.56s)]
*  I really hope that Israelis and Iranians would remember we have more in common than the government's that divide us. I [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=169.04s)]
*  Want to ask you as well, you know, we're hearing we're seeing responses from Iranian leaders [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=176.56s)]
*  Iran and senior officials are telling Reuters quote nowhere in Israel will be safe. Our revenge will be painful [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  Do your sources do people you're speaking to in the government there? Do you believe? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=189.22s)]
*  What they're saying that they had to strike now that Iran was at a point [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=195.66s)]
*  Getting close to having a capable nuclear weapon where their hand was forced [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=200.18s)]
*  Or do you think there's some there's some gray there as to whether or not this action had to be taken at this time [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=203.98s)]
*  Yeah from officials that I spoke to throughout the day it sounded like this [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=210.66s)]
*  Attack was actually planned for April much to get even from a certain I'll mention it then it was postponed [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=215.1s)]
*  and then the it was set for for last night because of the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  threat that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=226.74s)]
*  Israel according to the people I spoke to really couldn't [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=228.06s)]
*  let stand the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=231.66s)]
*  reaching the levels of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=234.94s)]
*  nuclear enrichment that would [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=236.74s)]
*  Allow them to use a nuclear bomb and mind you this is not a regime that is thinking logically [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=238.74s)]
*  It's not a regime that is hoping to achieve anything other than the complete and total annihilation of Israel [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=244.22s)]
*  And that's not me saying or speculating. This is what every [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=250.58s)]
*  Level of the Islamic Republic has said for years now [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=254.66s)]
*  And that's what Khamenei himself that I told us said today as well [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=258.86s)]
*  They are looking to use this nuclear weapon to destroy Israel [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=262.38s)]
*  So I do believe that Israel was left without any other choice than attacking last night [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=266.06s)]
*  Net now of course has become an increasingly controversial figure even there in Israel [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=272.9s)]
*  Of course his his government has survived because it made this coalition with with really hardline right-wing parties [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=278.85999999999996s)]
*  I'm wondering if you think given that you know so much more about the politics of your country than I do if [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=284.65999999999997s)]
*  Having an open conflict with Iran [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=290.34s)]
*  Strengthens or weakens net now whose position and his ability which at times has been fairly tenuous to hold on to power [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=293.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's just an excellent point and it's something that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=300.64s)]
*  Myself I'm struggling with because I am an opponent of Netanyahu [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=304.2s)]
*  Man, I've called out the government and and its actions [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  Publicly and objective to many of the policies and the way that they have conducted the war [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  And however with this issue of Iran, you know [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=318.32s)]
*  The Islamic Republic in Iran hasn't been a threat only to Netanyahu or only in its time [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  It's something that we've dealt with for years and I think that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  While it's definitely serving him. I'm hoping that Israel would remember that it's not [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=331.44s)]
*  Netanyahu that is using this [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=337.08s)]
*  strategic attacks and it's the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=340.03999999999996s)]
*  Incredible work of the Mossad and the security forces that are are operating but it's definitely serving him. Unfortunately [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=343.24s)]
*  But I don't give him much credit as I do to the security forces and and the Mossad for [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=350.4s)]
*  for this really important operation to deter the Islamic Republic from [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=356.67999999999995s)]
*  achieving nuclear power that will not only harm Israel but will [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=361.52s)]
*  destabilize the entire Middle East and would threat the entire world [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=364.64s)]
*  All right, and Mazig. Thank you so much for joining us. We're gonna view of your break [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VEtI8lPfM&t=368.44s)]
