# ‘Attack on our entire democratic system’: Dem lawmaker slams Trump deportations
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ)
*  Let's go to El Salvador and MSNBC's David Noriega, who's there with the very latest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=0.0s)]
*  for us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=5.16s)]
*  David, you're in the neighborhood where Abrego Garcia grew up. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=6.16s)]
*  What are you hearing from people there? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=9.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=11.6s)]
*  Ana, so I'm in a district of San Salvador called San Marcos. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=12.6s)]
*  This is where Abrego Garcia spent his childhood. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=17.48s)]
*  Now, back in the 2000s, when he was growing up here, this neighborhood, like so many in [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  the city, was controlled by gangs, more than the government itself, but gangs controlled [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=24.44s)]
*  this neighborhood. The family says that that is why a young kilmer at 16 years old had [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=29.4s)]
*  to flee to the United States because the gangs were targeting him for forcible recruitment. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=33.6s)]
*  Now, in the last three or four years, things here have changed dramatically. Five years [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=37.16s)]
*  ago, Ana probably wouldn't have been able to do what I'm doing now standing on the street [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=41.64s)]
*  talking to people, filming without permission from the gang that controlled this neighborhood. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=45.12s)]
*  Today, that is different. That is because the president here, Nayib Bukele, launched [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=49.2s)]
*  a sweeping crackdown against the gangs. He incarcerated more than 80,000 people, many [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=52.96s)]
*  without due process, in prisons that are notorious for being impossible to access. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=57.6s)]
*  Once people are in prison in this country, they have very little to no contact with the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=62.96s)]
*  outside world. Now, those are the circumstances under which Abrego Garcia and the 200 plus [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=66.64s)]
*  other deportees from the United States now find themselves in. People who live in neighborhoods [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=71.4s)]
*  like this, what they tell me is that on the one hand, they're very happy that things are [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=76.04s)]
*  peaceful. They can go out at any time of day or night. They don't have to worry about crossing [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=79.56s)]
*  invisible boundaries between different territories controlled by different gangs. And they're [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=83.56s)]
*  very grateful to the president for that. But also people are afraid, Ana, palpably afraid [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=88.0s)]
*  because they know there are many stories of people getting swept up in this crackdown [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  and thrown in prison with little recourse over very little evidence or for misunderstandings [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=95.86000000000001s)]
*  or for false accusations. And so people, on the one hand, they're very grateful and they [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=100.4s)]
*  enjoy this feeling of safety, but they're also afraid. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=105.12s)]
*  And the last thing I'll say, Ana, is that the human rights advocates and lawyers that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  I've been speaking to here in El Salvador, they say that the conditions of the megaprison [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=112.32s)]
*  where people are incommunicado, that's the default state for the Salvadoran prison system. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  And they're hoping that having their country at the center of international media attention [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=121.0s)]
*  will shed some light on those larger conditions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  Ana? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=127.36s)]
*  Well, we appreciate you shedding light for all of us on the situation there on the ground [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  in El Salvador. David Noriega, thank you for your reporting. Now, one of those congressmembers [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=132.56s)]
*  who just visited El Salvador is joining us now. Congressman Robert Garcia from California. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=138.08s)]
*  Congressman, you're just back from El Salvador. What came of your visit? Any progress? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's really important that people are there and continue the pressure on what [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  is clearly an illegal deportation of Kilmar Garcia and so many others. To be really clear, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  the United States Supreme Court has voted a 9-0 unanimous decision that Kilmar needs [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  to be facilitated and have a return back to the United States. Lower courts have affirmed [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=165.28s)]
*  this. The Trump administration themselves have admitted that they sent Kilmar Garcia [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=170.8s)]
*  there on accident. So there is no reason why he should not be back home. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=175.2s)]
*  And the real issue is really beyond an immigration story here or an immigration crisis. This [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=179.4s)]
*  is about the rule of law. It's about due process. It's about everyone in this country who under [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=185.28s)]
*  the Constitution is afforded due process whether they're a U.S. citizen, a temporary resident [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=190.64s)]
*  on a student visa. That is a bedrock of the United States of America. Now, we had meetings [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  yesterday, classified briefings with the U.S. ambassador, folks on the ground, Kilmar's family, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=201.04s)]
*  very, very productive, putting a lot of pressure on the Salvadorian government and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=207.92s)]
*  press to ensure that he is brought back home, but also lifting up the case of so many others that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=212.64s)]
*  have also received no due process. And I will say that we feel good about our efforts to continue [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=217.6s)]
*  this pressure. And now the president needs to do the right thing. Congressman, here is Speaker [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=223.84s)]
*  Johnson's statement about your visit there. He wrote on X yesterday, today, House Democrats [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=229.04s)]
*  traveled to El Salvador as part of their obsession to bring a violent illegal alien and member of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  MS-13 back into the United States. Could the contrast be more clear? House Republicans remain [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=239.68s)]
*  committed to doing everything we can to protect American families and keep dangerous gang members [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=245.92s)]
*  out of our country. And I should note just a quick fact there that there has been no specific [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  evidence about gang membership or, I guess, charges or convictions related to any potential crimes. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=257.28s)]
*  So that is important as we discuss this. And, of course, the administration [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=264.08s)]
*  admitted that they mistakenly deported Gilmar Arbrego-Garcia there. How do you respond to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=268.32s)]
*  what the speaker said about your priorities? You know, Mike Johnson has basically just become [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=273.2s)]
*  like Donald Trump. They choose to lie about whatever they want, deceive the American people [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=278.08s)]
*  about whatever topic they'd like to, and they have never presented in a court any evidence that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=282.24s)]
*  Arbrego-Garcia was part of this gang. They've never done it. And multiple courts, including [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=288.08s)]
*  the Supreme Court, have said that he needs to come back home and go through a due process. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=293.28s)]
*  And also, let's be clear. We're not there just to defend Gilmar-Garcia. We're there to defend [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=297.28s)]
*  the Constitution and due process in the United States. Donald Trump crossing this line is [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=301.84s)]
*  incredibly serious. Defining the Supreme Court is actually an attack on our entire democratic system [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=307.84s)]
*  in the United States. And look, it's not also just about Gilmar. There's a young man named [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=314.32s)]
*  Andres Romero who was swept up as he was going through the asylum process that we approved, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  by the way. We approved his asylum appointment in the United States. A young gay man, he was [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  a hairdresser, a makeup artist. He was swept up, taken to El Salvador. His family hasn't heard [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=328.08s)]
*  about him in weeks. We have no idea how he's doing. These are serious cases, and this could [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=333.12s)]
*  happen now to anyone, especially when you have Donald Trump saying in the Oval Office with the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  president of El Salvador that they also want to look at homegrown criminals. That means us. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  And so I think that all Americans should be concerned, and we've got to continue to be in [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=350.56s)]
*  El Salvador and any place where Donald Trump is trying to defy the law and eventually go after [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=355.12s)]
*  United States citizens. Democratic Congressman Robert Garcia, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=360.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkVuZJrc1eQ&t=385.12s)]
