# ‘No one is safe’: New Jersey congressman calls arrest of Newark Mayor a ‘clear act of intimidation’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50)
*  Welcome back to the weekend. We start this hour with the latest developments out of Newark, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=0.0s)]
*  New Jersey, where Mayor Ross Baraka is now free after federal officials arrested him [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=5.2s)]
*  on trespassing charges yesterday. The mayor was on site of Delaney Hall, the new immigration [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=10.88s)]
*  detention facility that is expected to play a central role in President Trump's mass deportation [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=16.16s)]
*  effort. Mayor Baraka had this to say on MSNBC following his release. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=21.52s)]
*  They obviously targeted me. It was more than I wasn't the only one out there. They came directly [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  to me and tried to arrest me. I was already there earlier that morning. I didn't need to, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  if I wanted to protest, I could have protested that morning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=39.44s)]
*  And to that point, not a protest. This was members of Congress and the mayor doing oversight. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=44.8s)]
*  Three members of Congress from New Jersey were present at the time of the chaotic scuffle and put [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=50.0s)]
*  their own bodies on the line to try and protect the mayor from being arrested. That includes [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=54.72s)]
*  Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, who denounced the mayor's arrest. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=59.2s)]
*  This is un-American. This breaks my heart that in the United States of America, as imperfect as it [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=64.8s)]
*  has been, there has never been this disrespect for individual rights, for positions, or for [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=72.56s)]
*  just justice in general. Joining us now, Representative Bob Menendez. Rob Menendez, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=80.64s)]
*  one of the congressmen who were with Mayor Baraka at their inspection of the new ICE facility, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=88.88s)]
*  and Catherine Christian, MSNBC legal analyst and a former assistant Manhattan District attorney. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=95.04s)]
*  Congressman, I want to start with you because you were there with the mayor. What was your [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=100.88s)]
*  initial reaction? Because you guys weren't there protesting. You were there doing your job, right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=106.24s)]
*  You were there serving oversight over a facility. Yeah, that's correct. And we had been there for [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  several hours that day, waiting to be brought into the facility. Over an hour and a half, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=118.88s)]
*  they had us waiting there. And eventually, all the upper brass from ICE Newark's field office came, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=125.36s)]
*  and they went right past us and went towards the gate. And that's when we realized Mayor Baraka was [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=132.32s)]
*  there. And then everything that you saw through video, through interviews, happened thereafter. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  And it was a situation that was calm for hours that, in my opinion, Homeland Security, ICE, HSI, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=145.04s)]
*  escalated quickly. Congressman, let me get your reaction to the acting ICE director when he had [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=151.12s)]
*  a message he had to deliver to Mayor Baraka on Fox News. And this happened today. Watch this. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=159.28s)]
*  We've heard intelligence that they're going to continue to protest. So he's trying not to make [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=166.08s)]
*  a statement. It's turned out to be a campaign ad, and he's putting folks at risk. It is wrong. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=170.08s)]
*  It's really frustrating, the fact, for him to say that he's out there protesting, when in fact, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  he wasn't, right? Officials had been in that jail last week. They found no issue with it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  The congresswoman yesterday said they visited inside and that people were being treated fairly [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=187.04s)]
*  and humane. So I just don't understand why you would do this. Congressman, there's a lot of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=191.2s)]
*  things in what the acting commissioner said that isn't exactly right. As Eugene said, and we're [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=197.84s)]
*  going to keep pointing it out, you guys were there, the mayor was there not to protest, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=205.28s)]
*  but to do oversight. Your reaction to what you just heard? Yeah. And so what I've been saying [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=210.16s)]
*  since yesterday is that this was a clear act of intimidation. The mayor has been consistent in [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=216.8s)]
*  that this facility is in his city. He wants to have the opportunity to go in, perform inspections. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=221.44s)]
*  I think that's entirely reasonable. We went there yesterday to perform our oversight authority. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=227.52s)]
*  But when you have 20 armed HSI ICE individual, if you have all these individuals show up with [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=233.44s)]
*  their police HSI jackets and they come to engage the mayor of the largest city of Newark and three [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=240.16s)]
*  members of Congress, how is this not intimidation? The fact that all those people that you're seeing [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=248.4s)]
*  in this video don't have their names on their uniforms, the fact that they're covering their [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=252.72s)]
*  faces, the fact that they have more than one firearm on them, over 20 armed individuals [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=258.08s)]
*  for three members of Congress and one mayor. That's an act of intimidation that's meant to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=264.88s)]
*  silence not just the mayor, not just the three of us, but everyone who's concerned about what's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=270.32s)]
*  happening in this country right now. Catherine, let's tap your legal expertise. What options does [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=275.04s)]
*  the Newark mayor have now? And what do you make of this situation and legal options for the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=282.72s)]
*  protesters too? Well, first off, thank goodness it was all captured on video so we get to see [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=288.88s)]
*  what really happened. The government, and I don't know how they will, but the government will have [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=296.08s)]
*  to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this was a restricted building, meaning not open to the public, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=300.88s)]
*  and that the mayor intended to disrupt and impede official government functions. I don't know how [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=306.56s)]
*  they will prove that beyond reasonable doubt, but that is the proof. Now an arrest does not mean a [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=314.56s)]
*  prosecution, so this could go away, but if there is a prosecution, the government is going to have [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=318.72s)]
*  to prove those elements. And what does the mayor have to do? He is wisely on the advice of his [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=324.24s)]
*  criminal defense counsels, not really spoke about the facts. We can see it for ourselves. He can, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=330.08s)]
*  obviously sue, bring an action for false arrests in federal law. That would be considered like a [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=338.24s)]
*  1983 action, a malicious prosecution. But let's not forget this happened in Newark, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=343.68s)]
*  and he's the mayor of Newark. And if this is public property, I would think that a mayor can go [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=351.12s)]
*  anywhere in his city where it's public. Congressman, I want to zoom out a little [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=356.16s)]
*  bit, right? Because, you know, mayor, members of Congress being roughed up in the way that we saw, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=361.68s)]
*  but it's happening to kind of everyday citizens around the country, right? We're seeing people [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=367.68s)]
*  being pulled off of the streets and not deported, but kicked out of the country over and over and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=373.6s)]
*  over again. And so I guess, what do you think these kinds of actions are telling the American [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  people, especially when they're dealing with powerful people like you guys? I think it's [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=385.68s)]
*  clear the administration wants to send a message that everyone in this country should be afraid, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=392.0s)]
*  that everyone should be fearful, that no one's safe, that no one's protected. I mean, the fact [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=396.32000000000005s)]
*  that you had three members of Congress and the way they were violent with us for just being there [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=403.36s)]
*  to perform our oversight authority, which we've done, by the way, two times this year already at [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=409.6s)]
*  the Elizabeth Detention Center with no issue. They knew why we were there. They chose to come out [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=415.76s)]
*  with over, again, 20 armed officers, the entirety of the Newark field office. And they came out to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=423.04s)]
*  intimidate us, to try to silence us, to try to silence the mayor. And I think the question [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=430.64s)]
*  every American should be asking themselves when they're watching this is who's safe in this country, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=435.28s)]
*  who's protected in this country with this administration in charge. And if they're being [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  honest with themselves and they have the chance to truly reflect on it, especially after what they [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  saw yesterday, I think they would know that the answer is no one. Catherine, let me get your [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=449.52s)]
*  reaction to more of what Mayor Baraka had to say after his release in his interview with Jen Psaki. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=454.48s)]
*  This is element one, the mayor talking about the dispute that he has with the detention facility. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  The reality is we're in a dispute. They have one point of view. We have another point of view. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=471.76s)]
*  But disputes are settled in court. ICE doesn't settle our disputes. Neither does the president [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=476.88s)]
*  of the United States, nor does the U.S. attorney. Disputes are settled in a court of law, which is [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=481.52s)]
*  what we were doing. They, you know, taking a leave from the president of the United States, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=487.2s)]
*  they feel like they could just violate any court and do whatever they want. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=491.12s)]
*  And so, Catherine, I'm just wondering, I mean, we've seen this over and over and over again. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=496.79999999999995s)]
*  Mayor Baraka got arrested. A federal judge in Wisconsin got arrested. We're seeing this happen. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=501.68s)]
*  What, I mean, what recourse does the mayor have? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=510.32s)]
*  Well, I think the congressman said it earlier. One could argue that this is an intent by the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=516.24s)]
*  government to intimidate, to not just intimidate the people who are being arrested, but to [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=521.84s)]
*  intimidate others. And the recourse is you fight. You get lawyers. Lawyers fight. The lawyers, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=526.96s)]
*  if this is a prosecution, as I said, this government is going to have to prove beyond [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=534.4s)]
*  a reasonable doubt that this mayor intended to impede and obstruct government functions. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=539.2s)]
*  It's even a question whether or not this restricted building, which is privately owned, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=545.6s)]
*  can be considered federal. So he will have criminal defense attorneys will fight. The [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=550.32s)]
*  judge in Wisconsin will too. And obviously there is the civil option for the mayor [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=556.96s)]
*  who can argue and will argue that this was a false arrest and violated his rights. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=564.08s)]
*  Outside of prison, the mayor's brother said, this is a sign we have to fight. We have to fight for [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  our rights. And so I want to pull up the quote from Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and get [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=575.2s)]
*  Congressman Menendez's response to that. So Congressman Jeffries released a statement saying, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=581.12s)]
*  the mass agents who physically accosted two congresswomen must be identified immediately [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=587.44s)]
*  and any trumped up charges against Mayor Baraka dropped. The specific role played by the for-profit [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=592.6400000000001s)]
*  operators of this detention center in today's disgraceful events will be heavily scrutinized [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=598.16s)]
*  in this congressional term and beyond. Presidents come and go, the House of Representatives will [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=603.52s)]
*  endure. So Congressman, what kind of scrutiny will be given to these for-profit operators? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=609.28s)]
*  Because this is big business. This is, you know, it reminds me of the private security contractors [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=616.24s)]
*  during the Iraq wars, war on terror, that you have so many military industrial contract contractors [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=621.68s)]
*  lining up. And so is Congress going to look into who is making money off of human suffering? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=629.52s)]
*  Well, we absolutely should. I think the question the American people have is, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=637.92s)]
*  are Republicans going to exercise their oversight authority as the majority party, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=641.76s)]
*  which they absolutely should. They should have answers for all of the allocation of federal [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=646.72s)]
*  dollars and oversight over federal contractors, especially ones the size and scale of these [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=652.0s)]
*  private detention center operators. But it's important to note that the people who physically [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=657.84s)]
*  assaulted Congresswoman MacGyver and Congresswoman Watson Coleman were members of the federal [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=663.28s)]
*  government. They were ICE officers. They were HSI officers, which means they were officers within [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=669.28s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security. They, if the administration wants to be a law and order [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=675.84s)]
*  administration, why would they not ask for clarity on what happened? Why would they not ask for the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=681.52s)]
*  names of the individuals who were there that day so they could get detailed understanding of what [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=688.64s)]
*  happened? You can't have it both ways. This administration wants to lie and gaslight the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_tJM0hf50&t=694.48s)]
