# Why Democrats traveled to El Salvador for Kilmar Abrego Garcia
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s)
*  The ACLU is sounding the alarm that the Trump administration has deported even more children [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=0.0s)]
*  who are U.S. citizens. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=5.68s)]
*  In a statement released Friday night, the organization saying New Orleans ICE agents [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=7.48s)]
*  deported at least two families early that morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=11.48s)]
*  Among them, U.S. citizen children aged two, four, and seven were deported with their mothers. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Goes on to say the families who had lived in the United States for years and had deep [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=21.52s)]
*  ties to their communities were deported from the U.S. under deeply troubling circumstances [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=25.4s)]
*  that raised serious due process concerns. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=30.4s)]
*  The statement came after a federal judge in Louisiana raised concerns that a two-year-old [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=33.48s)]
*  appeared to have been deported with her mother to Honduras with no meaningful due process. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=38.64s)]
*  Spheres grow over the administration's apathy toward constitutional rights. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=44.0s)]
*  The recent FBI arrest of Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan has some members of Congress worried [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=47.8s)]
*  that the administration is openly trying to intimidate the courts. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=52.28s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congresswoman Yasemin Ansari of Arizona. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  She recently returned from a trip to El Salvador with her colleagues to advocate for Kilmar [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=61.0s)]
*  Abrego Garcia, the imprisoned Maryland man who the Trump administration admits had mistakenly [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=64.8s)]
*  deported. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=70.48s)]
*  Congresswoman, good morning. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=71.48s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=72.48s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=73.48s)]
*  Do you? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=74.48s)]
*  I just, I mean, American citizens, children are being sent away to countries they do not [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=75.48s)]
*  know because their parent is either undocumented, we don't know, or maybe they were a legal [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=82.16s)]
*  permanent resident and the United States took their, we don't know the details for some [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=88.52s)]
*  of the things. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=92.88s)]
*  And these cases that were just, that Alicia laid on the table, these are just the ones [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=93.88s)]
*  we now know about. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=98.9s)]
*  They are doing exactly what they said they would do and I think people should be more [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=100.68s)]
*  up in arms about this. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  If we're not going to stand for American citizens, the children, what are we standing up for? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=110.16s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=115.72s)]
*  Yeah, so I represent Phoenix, Arizona, a district that is extremely diverse. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=116.72s)]
*  Many mixed status families, in general 64 languages are spoken. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=122.52s)]
*  So in my district, people have been very scared, sounding the alarm pre-Trump inauguration, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=126.6s)]
*  but especially since. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=135.04s)]
*  And I couldn't agree with you more. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=136.38s)]
*  I think the people, even those who were skeptical before that, you know, he's, you know, believe [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=137.76s)]
*  that he truly was going after criminals, I think are now waking up to the reality that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=143.6s)]
*  anyone could be next and there's no real due process going on here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  And I think we should all be concerned. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=152.26s)]
*  And I'm, you know, I'm grateful to see that there's finally polling that shows for the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=153.56s)]
*  first time Trump is underwater on immigration. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  I think that shows that the tide is shifting because I just don't believe that the vast [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=161.12s)]
*  majority of Americans are OK with what is happening now when it comes to U.S. citizens. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  You have The Washington Post going a little bit further into what both Alicia and Simone [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=170.88s)]
*  have put on the table, noting, the government is not disputing the immigration status of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  any of the three children. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  Instead, officials contend that the undocumented mothers opted to take their citizen children [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=184.0s)]
*  with them back to Honduras. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=190.04s)]
*  But a pin in that, it's important. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=192.72s)]
*  It is common that parents want to be removed with their children. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=194.6s)]
*  Trisha McLaughlin, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security told The Washington Post. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=197.72s)]
*  It's important to note that lawyers for VML, Father Gracie Willis says ICE refusal to allow [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=203.28s)]
*  the women to talk to their lawyers meant there was no way to verify whether that was true [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=210.28s)]
*  in these cases. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=215.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=216.4s)]
*  And the point I want you to put a pin in is the fact that it is common for parents to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=217.4s)]
*  want to be removed with their children. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=224.0s)]
*  So folks, let's not get this twisted. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=227.11999999999998s)]
*  They're using your kids as a way to deport you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=229.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=234.67999999999998s)]
*  Because in other words, you're not going to go if your mom with you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  I actually think it's the flip. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=238.04s)]
*  The flip. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=239.04s)]
*  They're using the parents to deport the kids, to pull the kids. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=240.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=242.88s)]
*  But it's also a way in which you can make the case which they're making, well, we didn't [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=243.88s)]
*  deport a U.S. citizen. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=248.6s)]
*  The mother took her child with her. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=250.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=252.88s)]
*  That's the fallacy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=254.84s)]
*  That's the lie. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=255.84s)]
*  It's all part of the- [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=256.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=257.84s)]
*  Because imagine you were in that room and all of a sudden a person who is in law enforcement [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=258.84s)]
*  says you're going back to your home country. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=261.04s)]
*  These kids are with you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=263.88s)]
*  You want them to come with you or do you want them to come temporarily into our care? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=264.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=268.44s)]
*  I would never hand my children over to someone I did not know. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=269.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=273.64s)]
*  And that's effectively using those children as a way to more readily and easily get you [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=274.64s)]
*  to leave. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=280.92s)]
*  And without much of a fight. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=282.48s)]
*  But then there's the last piece where we don't know really what the status of any of these [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=283.92s)]
*  individuals are and they don't have full access or any access to legal counsel. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=293.76s)]
*  How, as a member of Congress, oversight committed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=294.76s)]
*  We're sitting here. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=299.12s)]
*  What can be done? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  I almost feel like there's no movement. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  Everybody's looking to the courts but there's no other pincer move to kind of pressure this [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=306.0s)]
*  administration to stop what it's doing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=310.78s)]
*  I mean I do think, you know, frankly speaking outside of the, you know, typical ways any [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=314.14s)]
*  member of Congress would take action, which is legislatively of course, I think in this [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  moment the actions that we take outside of our typical capacity are going to be so important [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=326.32s)]
*  to change public sentiment. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=332.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean that's frankly why my colleagues and I decided to go to El Salvador. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=334.46s)]
*  I mean we did this personally. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=338.94s)]
*  This was not an official congressional delegation. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=340.4s)]
*  The Speaker wasn't going to give you the official... [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=342.78s)]
*  No, yeah, we got an official rejection actually from the chairman of the Oversight Committee [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=345.73999999999995s)]
*  and then a few of us cared very deeply about this issue and within 48 hours planned this [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=349.73999999999995s)]
*  trip and worked directly with the family's lawyer for Kilmar Abrego Garcia and hearing [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=356.09999999999997s)]
*  directly from the lawyer telling us thank you so much for doing this because this will [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=362.14s)]
*  keep the attention on this issue. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=367.46s)]
*  And I think again just in the last couple of days seeing the attention shift and I went [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=369.58s)]
*  on Fox News and talked about it and it was crazy to see just the lack of even like a [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=374.3s)]
*  real response to the, you know, unconstitutionality of it all. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=379.66s)]
*  There was no real response. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=384.1s)]
*  There was kind of just a mockery of, oh, the Constitution? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=385.1s)]
*  Yes, the Constitution. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=388.38s)]
*  If they don't understand the Constitution perhaps they will understand the politics [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=389.74s)]
*  of this and I think there's no one who understands the politics of this better than you given [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=392.94s)]
*  that you are from Arizona where we have watched this play out before. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=396.24s)]
*  You had SB 1070. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  You had Show Me Your Papers. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  It gave rise to a generation of dreamers who organized their communities. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=402.56s)]
*  It is part of the reason that we watched Arizona swing blue. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  We know politically how this plays out because yes, there may have been voters who voted [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  for Donald Trump because they wanted to see an orderly process at the U.S.-Mexico border [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=413.36s)]
*  and they did not feel that was happening under the previous administration. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=417.68s)]
*  They did not necessarily vote to watch U.S. citizens be pulled from their communities [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=420.96s)]
*  and sent to a country they didn't know. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=427.97999999999996s)]
*  My assessment here is that they have overplayed their hand. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=430.21999999999997s)]
*  That if they had focused on the exterior, on new arrivals, their immigration numbers [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=433.26s)]
*  would not be where they are. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=438.59999999999997s)]
*  The immigration disapproval numbers in my assessment are where they are because it is [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=439.82s)]
*  now impacting U.S. citizens because they are pulling people out of communities, people [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=444.06s)]
*  who have been here perhaps for a decade. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=449.18s)]
*  You feel that in your church. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=451.90000000000003s)]
*  You feel that in your school. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=453.34000000000003s)]
*  You feel that at your neighborhood party, right? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=454.78000000000003s)]
*  And so I think there's an opportunity here politically, which is the language they speak, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=457.22s)]
*  to say you have overplayed your hand. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=463.82s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=465.58s)]
*  I mean, I think in Arizona, that's a perfect example. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=466.58s)]
*  When you look at polling in the state even prior to this election, while there may be [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=469.86s)]
*  for a secure border, of course, Dreamers have very high support. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=475.56s)]
*  They always pull in the top five issues. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=480.56s)]
*  We passed a ballot measure a couple of years ago for free in-state tuition for Dreamers [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=482.4s)]
*  and DACA recipients who have been in this country for many years. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=487.88s)]
*  And so I think Arizonans in general, we are accustomed. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=491.12s)]
*  These are our friends. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=495.6s)]
*  My best friend, one of my best friends is a Dreamer in Arizona, and this is just normal. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=496.6s)]
*  And so to see those individuals targeted and their families be in deep fear, not even [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=500.8s)]
*  think that they can go to work or to school and whatnot, it's a real problem. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=506.92s)]
*  I agree there's going to be a backlash 100%. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=510.04s)]
*  It's disruptive for us all. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=511.88s)]
*  Congresswoman Yasemin Ansari, thank you so much. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=513.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=515.44s)]
*  Congresswoman. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=516.44s)]
*  And as we go to break, we are following breaking news out of Canada. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=517.44s)]
*  What made cars look into a Filipino street festival in Vancouver. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=519.28s)]
*  Authorities say nine people were killed, several others were injured. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=522.96s)]
*  Police have taken the driver into custody. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=526.72s)]
*  They say they are confident this is not an act of terrorism. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMk5Z8tl90s&t=528.24s)]
