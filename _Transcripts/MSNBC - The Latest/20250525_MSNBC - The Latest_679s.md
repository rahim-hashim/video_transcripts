# Americans are ‘beginning to feel’ Trump’s tariff whiplash
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw)
*  Joining me now, we have Aaron McLaughlin, a senior economist at the conference board [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Economy, Strategy and Finance Center, and Cornell Belcher, MSNBC political analyst [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=4.08s)]
*  and president of Brilliant Corners Research and Strategy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=9.18s)]
*  Welcome to you both. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=13.0s)]
*  Aaron, those unexpected Trump declarations really rattled markets. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=14.6s)]
*  The EU is the second biggest trading partner with the U.S. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=19.68s)]
*  What effect will a 50% tariff have on goods in the U.S.? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=22.78s)]
*  And do economists buy overall the Secretary Besant or Trump administration claims that [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=27.94s)]
*  these new tariffs are going to open potential dialogue? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=34.3s)]
*  Well, it is very interesting that this is part of a negotiation strategy, perhaps. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=37.58s)]
*  I understand that the secretary and EU and also our trade representative are in the process [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  of negotiations with the EU. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=48.78s)]
*  However, a 50% tariff would be a huge inconvenience and would really raise prices for consumers. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=51.38s)]
*  The EU is, as a bloc, is one of our largest trading partners. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=59.06s)]
*  We imported $606 billion in 2024 from the EU. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=64.06s)]
*  Currently, the tariff rate is at 10%. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=69.66s)]
*  So going up to 50 would be, would definitely cause a surge in prices. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=72.7s)]
*  Cornell, as you gauge public sentiment on the economic front, how fatigued are people [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=77.86s)]
*  with these sudden shifts by Donald Trump? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=82.62s)]
*  And how much is this affecting his overall support? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=84.7s)]
*  Look, you know, voters are right now less optimistic about the economy than they were, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=88.46s)]
*  quite frankly, during Biden's worst numbers. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=94.58s)]
*  And even going back to some subgroups of voters, they're less optimistic about the economy [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=98.7s)]
*  than they were around COVID, right? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  Reuters poll came out this past week and showed his job approval around the economy at an [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=107.02s)]
*  all-time low. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=114.97999999999999s)]
*  And his job approval overall has moved back and forth between, you know, over the last, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=115.82s)]
*  his last presidency in this one, his overall job approval moves back and forth between [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=120.74s)]
*  anywhere between 46% and 44%, 45%. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=124.74s)]
*  But his overall job pool right now is down at 42%. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=129.78s)]
*  But he's always had a plus job approval on the economy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=133.06s)]
*  Republicans historically had better numbers on the approving the economy than Democrats. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=137.86s)]
*  But right now, he's way underwater with overall economy and even further underwater with handling [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  inflation. At the same time, voters feeling that a recession is coming on and consumer, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=149.62s)]
*  you know, as you know, consumer confidence is cratering. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=154.70000000000002s)]
*  And it is absolutely impacting his numbers. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=158.78s)]
*  I want to pick up on that with you, Erin, because there's a headline I want to share [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=161.54s)]
*  from your organization. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=164.14s)]
*  U.S. consumer confidence plunged again in April. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=165.58s)]
*  Expectations for the future at a 13-year low. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=168.46s)]
*  What is driving that, Erin? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=172.38s)]
*  Are people actually feeling this tear of whiplash already in their pocketbooks? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=173.9s)]
*  I think they are just beginning to feel it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=178.7s)]
*  So, of course, so many surveys are sort of backwards looking. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=181.18s)]
*  And Liberation Day was in early April. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=184.3s)]
*  So we're only, you know, just about five or six weeks out from a lot of these tariffs [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=187.98s)]
*  taking to effect. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=193.1s)]
*  So, you know, our CPI and some of the other inflation numbers haven't yet hit. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=193.98s)]
*  But that expectation that consumers know it's coming is really driving them to have very, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=198.62s)]
*  very low expectations. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=205.98s)]
*  And yes, we have not seen an expectation that low since 2011. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=207.33999999999997s)]
*  Cornell, have Democrats effectively messaged on the Trump economy? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=212.62s)]
*  Because given the tear of whiplash, you'd think it would be target-rich for them. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=216.54s)]
*  You know, it's funny, effective messaging and Democrats don't necessarily go together [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=222.45999999999998s)]
*  very well. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=226.22s)]
*  What is that? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=226.62s)]
*  It's like herding cats, Alex. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=229.1s)]
*  It's like herding cats. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=230.45999999999998s)]
*  But look, I think this is an opportunity. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=232.45999999999998s)]
*  When the president's numbers have gone underwater with the economy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=234.7s)]
*  And look, we did focus groups two weeks ago, and voters aren't quite frankly understanding [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=238.38s)]
*  the tariff, but they know it's bad and they know it's going to and they feel it's going [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=243.74s)]
*  to get worse. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=247.5s)]
*  So it gives Democrats an opening on the economy, the likes of which we haven't had in a long [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=248.46s)]
*  and that they haven't had in a very long time because voters are turning sour on the economic [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=253.5s)]
*  policies and the economic direction that this president is giving. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=258.46000000000004s)]
*  I think it's a prime opportunity for Democrats to put together an economic package that is [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=261.98s)]
*  about, you know, about everyone thriving and lifting all boats. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=266.3s)]
*  And I think around this tax bill that they've just pushed through, which, you know, MSMEC [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=270.86s)]
*  has reported on, most of those benefits don't go to regular working class Americans. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=276.22s)]
*  And I think it's an excellent opportunity for Democrats to start speaking to the economic [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  angst, the growing economic angst of working class Americans and put the Republicans on [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  the defensive. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=289.98s)]
*  You know, Aaron, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon spoke this week on the risks of stagflation. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=291.18s)]
*  Take a listen to this. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=295.98s)]
*  You'll have stagflation. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=298.3s)]
*  I'm not saying it's going to happen. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=299.58s)]
*  I don't want the real say he's predicting that I'm not, but we have to be prepared for [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=300.7s)]
*  something like that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=304.78s)]
*  I think the global fiscal deficits are inflationary. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=305.82s)]
*  So Apple is now one of several major U.S. companies like Wal-Mart, Target, warning [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=309.65999999999997s)]
*  consumers pricing pressures are going to hit store shelves soon. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=314.38s)]
*  The Conference Board doesn't see a recession per se, but if consumers stop spending, could [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=318.06s)]
*  Jamie Dimon be right? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=322.86s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=325.41999999999996s)]
*  So one element of stagflation is rising unemployment. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=326.22s)]
*  And so that's really consumers may cut back when they think that prices are going up, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=329.5s)]
*  but they're still going to spend. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=334.14000000000004s)]
*  Two thirds of our economy is about consumer spending. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=335.74s)]
*  But once someone becomes unemployed, a member of their family becomes unemployed, that's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=338.94000000000005s)]
*  when we see spending really come back in. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=344.46000000000004s)]
*  And it can have a little bit of a spiral effect. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=347.58000000000004s)]
*  So right now we have very, very low unemployment. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=349.98s)]
*  It's about 4.2 percent. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=353.74s)]
*  We do predict that these tariffs will cause a rise in unemployment and that we will jump [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=355.74s)]
*  over 4.5, perhaps to 4.7 percent or higher. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=360.54s)]
*  So it will, you know, it will yet to be seen. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=364.86s)]
*  But the other point is a company like Apple, the kind of time it takes to set up to onshore [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=368.7s)]
*  a manufacturing facility to build iPhones, regardless of cost, it takes years. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=375.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=382.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  Cornell, Donald Trump held that crypto dinner this week. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=383.9s)]
*  I mean, it cost over what, a million dollars a plate on average to attend. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=386.46s)]
*  But Democrats say it's a sign of corruption against the backdrop of this economic uncertainty [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=389.65999999999997s)]
*  and the tariff whiplash. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=395.26s)]
*  How does that dinner play? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=396.94s)]
*  I think that dinner plays, I think it's hard for Republicans to spend this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=399.9s)]
*  And I've been watching them trying to spend this over the last couple of days. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=403.26s)]
*  I don't think this should be a partisan issue, right? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=409.41999999999996s)]
*  Our founding fathers feared this sort of thing, and they tried to build in checks to make [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=411.98s)]
*  sure that our presidency wouldn't be one where the president enriched himself and his family [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=415.58000000000004s)]
*  and benefited economically from being in the office. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=421.98s)]
*  And clearly you see, and again, I'm not going to be, this shouldn't be partisan. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=426.70000000000005s)]
*  This should be bipartisan. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=430.38s)]
*  This was a fear of our founding fathers. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=432.06s)]
*  We had someone in office clearly benefiting and his family benefiting from him being in [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=433.74s)]
*  the presidency. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=439.98s)]
*  And look, Americans, if you're Democrat, Republican, independent, you cannot be for [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=440.94s)]
*  what you see this wholesale corruption, him selling the White House. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=446.46s)]
*  This on top of taking a $400 million plate from Qatar, it just stinks. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=449.34s)]
*  And voters begin to smell it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=453.5s)]
*  And when you look at those independent voters who are actually turning hard against the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=455.66s)]
*  president right now, Republicans have a hard time spinning this, and they're going to have [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=460.54s)]
*  to figure out how to spend this going into the midterm election. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=466.3s)]
*  Because those economic numbers keep rising, issues keep rising, and Lord forbid the unemployment [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=469.74s)]
*  rises like we just talked about. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=476.62s)]
*  It's going to be a perfect storm against the Republicans. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=479.02s)]
*  You know, Aaron, the president has repeatedly claimed the tariffs are not going to affect [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=481.58s)]
*  Americans. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=486.86s)]
*  Again, he said it this week. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=487.74s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=489.34000000000003s)]
*  They're not hurting. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=491.90000000000003s)]
*  They're helping because they're creating jobs in America. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=492.62s)]
*  We're creating tremendous amounts of jobs in America like you've never seen. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=494.94s)]
*  We're having investment in America. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=498.78s)]
*  We're not getting ripped off by every country in the world. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=500.46s)]
*  Does the business world buy any of this? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=504.46s)]
*  I mean, are jobs being created? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=506.94s)]
*  Is the investment as notable as he suggests? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=508.85999999999996s)]
*  I mean, we just talked about potential unemployment. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=511.9s)]
*  We have not seen. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=516.06s)]
*  We've seen unemployment tick up very, very slightly in the last few months. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=518.4599999999999s)]
*  We have not seen the creation of any new jobs. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=521.98s)]
*  Again, onshore takes many, many years to build factories, to finance the building of those [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=524.38s)]
*  factories, and you have to have qualified available employment. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=530.3s)]
*  Also, the new factories are not the factories of decades ago. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=533.98s)]
*  They are automated in large part. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=538.38s)]
*  They use robotics. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=540.3s)]
*  And so that's another component that is very, very expensive. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=541.74s)]
*  Terrace also weigh on the cost of building these factories with steel, aluminum, lumber, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=544.86s)]
*  and all of the components that go in them. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=549.82s)]
*  So, you know, it's not as if just the policy of tariffs is, you know, flawed. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=551.66s)]
*  It's that changing our industrial manufacturing base takes years. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=558.06s)]
*  You know, Cornell, again, the president saying they're not hurting. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=564.54s)]
*  They're helping when it comes to tariffs or creating tremendous jobs in America like you've [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=567.18s)]
*  never seen. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=571.98s)]
*  Well, the never seen part, perhaps is the is the public buying what he's saying? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=572.4599999999999s)]
*  No, it's not going to happen. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=577.5s)]
*  I'm sure it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=581.18s)]
*  But let me say something much broader, right? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=581.98s)]
*  And it is Wall Street. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=586.06s)]
*  For better or worse, worse campaigns cost a lot of money in this country. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=588.94s)]
*  And Wall Street and big corporations have backrolled the president and Republicans. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=592.54s)]
*  And at this point, when you look at the sort of uncertainty and chaos that he's that he's [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=598.54s)]
*  inflicting, you have to ask, look, Wall Street, is the tax cuts worth it? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=602.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=607.74s)]
*  Are these tax cuts worth this sort of economic chaos and uncertainty? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=608.62s)]
*  Because you know better. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=613.1800000000001s)]
*  And here's the other thing. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=614.46s)]
*  Look, Yamiche talked about it in the last segment. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=615.2600000000001s)]
*  You know, he went out there and bashed Obama and Biden, you know, at this, which something [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=618.94s)]
*  is unheard of before those cadets. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=624.62s)]
*  But imagine for one moment that Barack Obama was interfering in the free market system [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=627.2600000000001s)]
*  the way Donald Trump is. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=632.54s)]
*  Imagine how Wall Street would lose their stuff. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=634.38s)]
*  They would lose their minds. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=638.3s)]
*  Barack Obama was having this sort of chaos and pain inflicted just on a whim. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=640.4599999999999s)]
*  Wall Street elections coming up, you got to make them pay for this. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=648.6999999999999s)]
*  If you pull the plug on the pocketbook, and a lot of this might stop. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vSpP0TYTw&t=653.26s)]
