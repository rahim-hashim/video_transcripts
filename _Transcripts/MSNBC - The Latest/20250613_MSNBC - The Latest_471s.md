# ‘Canary in the coal mine moment’: Nicolle on Trump appealing California National Guard decision
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg)
*  We begin today with what threatens to be a full-blown constitutional crisis right here [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=0.0s)]
*  at home, with consequences for every American. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=6.28s)]
*  Events in Los Angeles could be merely the canary in the coal mine when it comes to which [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  path we take and the very future of our democracy. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=16.68s)]
*  The Trump administration is heading into the weekend, facing protests nationwide from a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=20.76s)]
*  galvanized opposition and a sharp rebuke written for the history books from a federal judge. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=26.2s)]
*  That opinion amounts to a legal body blow to Trump's efforts to use the United States [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=33.64s)]
*  military against Americans. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=39.28s)]
*  It's a ruling currently paused by an appeals court from federal judge Charles Breyer. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  That order says that Donald Trump can no longer mobilize and command California's National [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=47.92s)]
*  Guard troops over the wishes of California's governor, Gavin Newsom. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=54.16s)]
*  The judge went even further, though, than what the state of California asked for, which [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=59.279999999999994s)]
*  was an order limiting what exactly the troops could do on the streets of Los Angeles. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=64.92s)]
*  The judge said that Donald Trump's, quote, actions were illegal, both exceeding the scope [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=70.28s)]
*  of his statutory authority and violating the 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=76.84s)]
*  This is from the ruling, quote, He must therefore return control of the California National [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=83.88s)]
*  Guard to the governor of the state of California forthwith. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  The judge went on to say that Donald Trump's order deploying the National Guard, quote, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=92.56s)]
*  sets a dangerous precedent for future domestic military activity. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=97.8s)]
*  The citizens of Los Angeles face a greater harm from the continued unlawful militarization [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=101.72s)]
*  of their city, which not only inflames tensions with protesters, threatening increased hostilities [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  and loss of life, but deprives the state for two months of its own use of thousands [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=113.1s)]
*  of National Guard members to fight fires, combat fentanyl trade, and perform other critical [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=118.96s)]
*  functions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=124.86s)]
*  Here's what California Governor Gavin Newsom had to say about the ruling. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=125.86s)]
*  Today was really about a test of democracy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=132.42s)]
*  And today we passed the test. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=136.45999999999998s)]
*  We the people passed the test. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=138.34s)]
*  Donald Trump has tested the limits of that and has done so consistently. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=140.7s)]
*  But today's order makes clear that he is not above or beyond constitutional constraints. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=145.98s)]
*  Governor Newsom also took Trump to task, calling him out for suddenly suggesting that he's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=156.7s)]
*  going to protect farm workers from deportations. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=161.98s)]
*  Take a listen to Newsom. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=164.98s)]
*  This is what he does. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=167.64s)]
*  He creates a problem and then he tries to be a hero in his own Marvel movie. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=168.64s)]
*  Did it on Ted. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=176.2s)]
*  Fill in a blank. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=177.7s)]
*  On almost every topic, creates the problem and then tries to do a make-believe as if [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=178.92s)]
*  you're all perfect little sheep and you're going to go on with it to be the hero in his [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=186.2s)]
*  own Marvel movie. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  He initiated those raids. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=195.6s)]
*  He significantly increased the scale and scope of those raids. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=198.44s)]
*  That's why he wants the National Guard. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=201.96s)]
*  It's where we start today with some of our favorite reporters and friends. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=205.64s)]
*  In Los Angeles for us once again, my friend and colleague, NBC News correspondent Jacob [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=208.24s)]
*  Soboroff. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=212.5s)]
*  Also joining us, MSNBC political analyst, host of the Bullwork podcast, Tim Miller is [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=213.82s)]
*  back as well. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=218.0s)]
*  And with me at the table, NYU law professor, MSNBC legal analyst Melissa Murray is here. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=219.0s)]
*  Melissa, can you just talk to me like I'm not a lawyer because I'm not and help me [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=224.64s)]
*  understand the status of this really strong ruling last night? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  So Judge Breyer issued this ruling. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=234.83999999999997s)]
*  He had a hearing yesterday in his courtroom. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  He issued the ruling very quickly. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=238.76s)]
*  It's a 36 page ruling, a blistering ruling and a blistering indictment of this administration's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=240.27999999999997s)]
*  actions. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  I will note that it is not necessarily far ranging. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  Judge Breyer, who is the younger brother of Justice Stephen Breyer, former member of the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=250.2s)]
*  United States Supreme Court, said that Donald Trump exceeded his authority in federalizing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=254.6s)]
*  the National Guard, that he has to do so with the consultation of California's governor, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=259.96s)]
*  which did not happen here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=263.44s)]
*  But as to the deployment of the Marines to Los Angeles, Judge Breyer said that it would [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=264.84s)]
*  be premature to rule on that because those Marines are simply protecting federal buildings [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  right now, which is totally within the scope of federal and presidential authority. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=274.8s)]
*  So that's on the table for now. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=278.2s)]
*  What this means right now is this was obviously appealed by the administration to the Ninth [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=280.21999999999997s)]
*  Circuit, which is the intermediate appellate court over California. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=284.78s)]
*  And the Ninth Circuit stayed the ruling until it can conduct a hearing on June 17th, so [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=288.92s)]
*  next Tuesday. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=294.4s)]
*  So that means for this weekend when these protests and the no-kings protests and the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=295.4s)]
*  parade are supposed to happen, we will actually see the National Guard acting under the auspices [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  of presidential authority and not the governor's consultation in Los Angeles. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=305.68s)]
*  So that can continue to happen and then the Ninth Circuit will step in. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=310.04s)]
*  Will it be moot at that point? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=313.6s)]
*  It really depends on what the president does with regard to protests in other cities and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=315.68s)]
*  whether he will be nationalizing the National Guard in those other venues, too. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=319.48s)]
*  Does the ruling on the substance, which I understand has stayed, impact the legal terrain [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=323.76s)]
*  of Trump decides to deploy National Guard troops to other states with Democratic or [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=330.84s)]
*  Republican governors who don't ask for them? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=335.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think it definitely provides a blueprint for other courts that are considering this [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  issue. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=342.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I don't think this is a very difficult question. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  There are two federal statutes in play here. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  There is Section 12406, which is the statute that the president has used here. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  It typically is invoked to nationalize the National Guard in tandem with some aspects [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=354.12s)]
*  of the Insurrection Act. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=359.17999999999995s)]
*  It's only been used without the consultation of a state's governor in, to my knowledge, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=360.52s)]
*  two circumstances, both involving civil rights. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=364.54s)]
*  So it was deployed by President Eisenhower in the 1950s to integrate Central High School [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=367.44s)]
*  in Little Rock, Arkansas. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=371.94s)]
*  It was later used by President Johnson to protect civil rights marchers in Selma, Alabama, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=373.42s)]
*  without the consultation, obviously, of those states' governors. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=378.82s)]
*  But otherwise, it's really been used as a kind of collaborative consultative method [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=381.86s)]
*  with the president consulting with the governor of the state in order to nationalize the state's [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=387.18s)]
*  guard in that way. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=392.38s)]
*  And Judge Breyer laid all of that out very clearly. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=393.58000000000004s)]
*  And I think if this spreads to other cities, on blue cities throughout the country, this [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=396.42s)]
*  is going to be a very potent blueprint for other courts who are examining the same issue. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=400.78000000000003s)]
*  You said blistering. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=405.22s)]
*  I mean, in some places it almost reads like a fact check. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=406.22s)]
*  There is no invasion. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=408.94s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think that's a question about the statutory language. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=409.94s)]
*  So when the president gets to invoke this section of the act and without the consultation [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=414.1s)]
*  of the governor, he has to have to meet certain statutory standards, certain statutory conditions. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=420.26000000000005s)]
*  And one of those is that we are being invaded. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=425.1s)]
*  We are in open rebellion. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=427.66s)]
*  And Judge Breyer sort of just stepped through the language of the statute. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=429.18s)]
*  I mean, this is reading, basically, and said, that's not what's happening here. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=432.06s)]
*  In fact, what is happening here is that we have individuals who are protesting, exercising [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  their First Amendment rights, rights that literally this country was founded on. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=441.5s)]
*  And it cannot be the case that mere protest amounts to an invasion or rebellion. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oj8_FbpHAg&t=445.74s)]
