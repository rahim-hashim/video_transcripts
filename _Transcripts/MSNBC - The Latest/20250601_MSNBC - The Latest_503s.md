# Trump’s budget bill gives Democrats ‘a lot of ammo’ to use in 2026 midterms: Dem. strategist
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI)
*  New comments today from Democratic Senator Chris Murphy slamming the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=0.0s)]
*  Republican mega bill and its heavy cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. This says the clock [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=4.2s)]
*  is ticking with the Senate returning to work tomorrow and Republicans aiming to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=9.16s)]
*  get the bill on President Trump's desk by the 4th of July. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  The reality is this bill is about life and death and for what? I mean I guess [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  that's the problem here for many of us is that they're cutting Medicaid throwing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=22.92s)]
*  15 million people off their health care in order to fund a tax cut for the super [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=27.72s)]
*  wealthy and for corporations. That is just fundamentally immoral. It's immoral [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=33.96s)]
*  and it's unethical. I don't understand why they're doing it except that Donald [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=39.28s)]
*  Trump only really knows billionaires. He only knows corporate CEOs and so his [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=43.68s)]
*  instructions to Republicans are reward them, help them and no one else. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=49.32s)]
*  Don Calloway, Susan Del Percio and Brendan Buck are back with me. So Don, this is the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=54.6s)]
*  message that Democrats have tried to stick with for this bill that it's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=59.68s)]
*  taking away health care and money away from low-income Americans to give it to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=62.84s)]
*  billionaires. Is that message resonating? I don't know if it's resonating but I [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  think you know if I could step into my Susan Del Percio for a moment really [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=73.6s)]
*  quick and think about what will resonate. You know, Trump put together a multiracial [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  multi-socioeconomic coalition. Nobody can take that away from him and frankly [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=82.16s)]
*  Democrats were blindsided by the coalition he was able to cobble [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  together. But the question for the next day after the election that still [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=89.12s)]
*  persists today is will you be included in the governance? And as a matter of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=93.12s)]
*  fact, this bill shows that no, not only will you not be included in the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=98.36s)]
*  governance, all the people he brought together to vote for him, but you'll [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=101.76s)]
*  actually be heard from. And Joni Ernst learned that the hard way by saying you [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=104.36s)]
*  know grandma's got everybody's got to die sometime. No, these members, these [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=108.6s)]
*  senators and these House members who have to take this very hard vote on this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  bill that will have extraordinary real life ramifications for people's kitchen [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=116.91999999999999s)]
*  tables, those folks are not Trump. Trump is somehow found himself to be immune [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=120.8s)]
*  but those folks are not Trump and the American people, not just Democrats, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=126.11999999999999s)]
*  everybody who's hurt from the bill will have a real opportunity to hold them [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=130.68s)]
*  accountable. The thing that Trump has to his advantage is that all of us have [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=134.34s)]
*  a memory about the size of a tick tock reel. And so Democrats are going to have [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=138.48s)]
*  to hone in on those points about how this really harms kids. It pushes [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=142.2s)]
*  millions of kids into poverty for a few billionaires and you have to hone in on [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=146.68s)]
*  those messages now and develop them consistently for almost another year [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=151.16s)]
*  and a half and that's going to be hard to do. But this bill gives them a lot [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=155.88s)]
*  of ammo. So Susan, you've you've argued that Democrats probably can't stop [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=159.86s)]
*  Trump's mega bill, but they can focus on other targets, easier ones. You have [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=164.04s)]
*  written quote, Trump loves to talk about what he wants to do. Why can't the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=168.92s)]
*  Democrats use the same playbook? So expand on that. And wouldn't Medicaid be [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=172.48s)]
*  a popular issue on which to do that? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=177.72s)]
*  Well, Trump constantly says he's going to not cut Medicaid and that message also [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=181.36s)]
*  gets through in other news outlets. So what I was speaking about were things [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=186.56s)]
*  like over Memorial Day weekend, for example, Alex, why isn't why aren't [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=191.28s)]
*  Democrats out at their airport saying it is unsafe due to Donald Trump? Stop [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=195.8s)]
*  worrying about, oh, well, it happened to both administrations. Go out and do it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=201.36s)]
*  after every natural disaster. Let's talk about Trump wanting to cut the weather [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  services. There are things that Democrats can do that show that they are being [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=210.12s)]
*  pro active on what they want to get done instead of just fighting Donald Trump. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=215.08s)]
*  You can go after those Doge cuts. If you live in a district where a lot of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=221.4s)]
*  people were fired, go out and talk to those people. They're about to cut [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  veteran affairs with a huge layoffs. So why not go to those districts or go to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=229.16s)]
*  the places where it's impacting now? The issue with this bill is people won't [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  feel the impact for two years. Republicans will say you're keeping [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=241.44s)]
*  your tax cut. So that's that happens today. But the cuts that are being [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=246.16s)]
*  discussed are far away. Talk about the things that impact people now. All [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=251.48s)]
*  right, Don, you reference Senator Joni Ernst. So, Brendan, we're gonna go there [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=258.2s)]
*  with you because this weekend she seemed to double down on her flippant [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=261.96s)]
*  response to concerns Medicaid cuts would cause people to die. And she said, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=265.28s)]
*  well, we're all gonna die. Then she posted this non apology apology on [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=269.32s)]
*  social media yesterday. Listen up. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=274.26000000000005s)]
*  I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=277.62s)]
*  that, yes, we are all going to perish from this earth. So I apologize. And [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=286.26000000000005s)]
*  I'm really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=295.34000000000003s)]
*  tooth fairy as well. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=300.42s)]
*  Yeah, does this seem like a smart strategy or a snarky one? Because [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=302.3s)]
*  Republicans seem to feel like they can say anything. This is gonna backfire. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=307.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, you certainly can't apologize. And that's one of the GOP mantras from [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=312.1s)]
*  that they've learned from Donald Trump. You can never back down. So I think [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=315.5s)]
*  that's what's going on here. But how does she get herself in this situation [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=318.14s)]
*  in the first place? I think it speaks to how quickly this bill and policy has [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=321.62s)]
*  been coming together in a very slap dash way. And I think it's to why [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=325.90000000000003s)]
*  they're losing the argument in a lot of places. Look, there were a lot of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=331.38s)]
*  things that they talked about doing on Medicaid much more aggressive than what [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=334.94s)]
*  they were actually going to do that they actually ended up doing. Real [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=338.86s)]
*  like budgetary cuts that they decided not to do. Where they landed was [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=342.9s)]
*  simply a work requirement where if you are able bodied and you want us to pay [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=347.34s)]
*  for Medicaid for you, you need to go find a job, go to school, do something [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=352.65999999999997s)]
*  in the community. That's the policy. But they haven't figured out how to say [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=356.65999999999997s)]
*  that or how to explain that. And that's how you end up with senators saying [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=359.82s)]
*  stuff like that. And why Chris Murphy gets away with saying what he did, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=362.65999999999997s)]
*  which a lot of it was misleading. This isn't a tax cut for corporations. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=366.46s)]
*  There's nothing to do with corporations in this bill. But those talking points [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=370.58s)]
*  that have been out there for so long, you have Republicans who don't even know [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=374.38s)]
*  how to talk about the only thing they're doing themselves is the only policy [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=378.02s)]
*  that they're working on this year and they can't even explain what it is. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=380.9s)]
*  So of course you're going to end up losing the conversation. Can I just ask [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=383.34s)]
*  you quickly? I mean, you were former press secretary to Speaker Boehner. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=386.58000000000004s)]
*  Do you think she cleared that video with somebody on her team? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=390.02000000000004s)]
*  Was that kind of like she put it out there and they're thinking, oh, come on, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=393.98s)]
*  really? No, I look there's no party control of any more. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=396.90000000000003s)]
*  And look, yeah, she was somebody who ran for the leadership position to be their [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=402.18s)]
*  head of communications. And she lost that race. But I think it just kind of shows [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=406.82000000000005s)]
*  you that people aren't really worrying about like the broader universe. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=411.78000000000003s)]
*  As we talked about before, the people you talk to and your little ecosystem and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=415.58000000000004s)]
*  your information bubble, you're going to get a pass from them. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=420.3s)]
*  And so they don't really work about work on reaching a broader audience. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=422.94s)]
*  And this is what you end up with. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=426.54s)]
*  Don, can Democrats capitalize on GOP missteps like this? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  We can, but it's going to have to be it's going to it's very hard because it's [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=432.70000000000005s)]
*  going to have to be a coordinated message among several distinguished speakers. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=436.5s)]
*  Right now, we don't have anybody with the singular magnitude of Donald Trump or [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=441.02000000000004s)]
*  that platform. So I'm really looking forward to Jim Clyburn plan, another [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=445.42s)]
*  unifying senior role. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=450.14s)]
*  As we saw, everybody was down at the fish fry and he remains a singular figure. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=451.78s)]
*  And he remains an important figure. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=455.94s)]
*  And I think that Hakeem Jeffries has not yet grown into the role of someone who [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=457.78s)]
*  has command of all the Democratic coalition of ears around the country. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=461.7s)]
*  So I'm looking forward to seeing how Jim Clyburn is going to help disseminate the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=465.14s)]
*  same message across the broad Democratic coalition. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=469.38s)]
*  But we can't do it because this bill is extraordinarily harmful to real people. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=472.38000000000005s)]
*  OK, I'm out of time, which means ladies first next time, Susan, you go first. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=475.86s)]
*  There you have it. You've heard it near. Thank you. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=480.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpTMDokUjKI&t=502.22s)]
