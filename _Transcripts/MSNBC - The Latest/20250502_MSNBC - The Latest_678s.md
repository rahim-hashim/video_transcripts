Video Description: While the April jobs report beat expectations, there is still a lot of concern over the impact of President Trump’s tariffs. China says it is “evaluating” a tariff proposal with the U.S. Meanwhile, the White House budget is calling for $163 billion in federal cuts. NBC News White House Correspondent Yamiche Alcindor, CNBC Senior Economics Reporter Steve Liesman, Axios Economics Reporter Courtenay Brown and Reuters White House Correspondent Jeff Mason join Alex Witt to break it all down.

# Is Trump’s low approval raising alarm bells? Policies may have ‘down-ballot effect’ for GOP
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0)
*  We begin with NBC News White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor, CNBC's senior economics [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=0.0s)]
*  reporter Steve Leesman, Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason, and Axios economics [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  reporter Courtney Brown. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=10.48s)]
*  Welcome to you all. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=11.76s)]
*  So, Steve, what stands out to you most from the jobs report? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=12.76s)]
*  Well, it's a good report. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=16.12s)]
*  It's always better to have a job number that beats expectations. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  There was some strength in a variety of places, including health care, a perennial place that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=22.38s)]
*  we've had job growth that was there, financial activities, professional business services. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=27.88s)]
*  Put that over on one side. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=32.56s)]
*  On the other side, there were perhaps some signs of what is to come in the economy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=33.88s)]
*  For example, you pointed out that transportation and warehousing number up 29,000. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=38.2s)]
*  Almost certainly that's going to go off if you correlate cargo or what's happening in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=43.36s)]
*  the transportation business with jobs in that business. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  As that declines, the jobs in the business will decline. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=50.68s)]
*  You also had a decline in retail down just 1,000, but you can imagine that's a place [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=53.78s)]
*  where small businesses might be taking it on the chin from the tariffs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  Manufacturing was down 1,000. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=62.14s)]
*  Of course, federal government down 9,000. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=63.5s)]
*  Some of that is not what's happening, what happened with DOGE may not be showing up for [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=66.62s)]
*  two reasons. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=71.1s)]
*  One is that people got severance so they don't show up as a job loss. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=72.1s)]
*  The second one is that some of these jobs will be, were restored by the courts. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=75.42s)]
*  So that's not necessarily a job loss right now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=81.72s)]
*  So there are signs to come of what may happen from the tariffs and the uncertainty that's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=84.7s)]
*  out there in the economy. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=89.06s)]
*  But right now, it's pretty good. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=90.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  We'll take the good. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=94.16s)]
*  Better than expected jobs report. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=95.16s)]
*  But let me add to the woes to consider because we also saw this week the first GDP drop in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=96.16s)]
*  three years and consumer confidence has hit a five-year low. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=102.06s)]
*  So big picture. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=107.44s)]
*  Is the economy in a tariff-induced funk or are we heading into a long-term slide? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=108.44s)]
*  So funk is an interesting word. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=114.1s)]
*  I take that advisedly. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=116.08s)]
*  I just wonder if it's more limbo right now. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=117.66s)]
*  And the question I think we have to ask ourselves right now, the market has been on about a [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=120.66s)]
*  nine or a 10-day winning streak here as to whether or not it's rescuable. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=125.16s)]
*  Maybe what I think this job's number shows is that there has been some resilience to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  the job, to the economy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=135.24s)]
*  There is an ability to overcome some of the problems that are out there. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=137.60000000000002s)]
*  I'm not uniformly negative on this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=141.56s)]
*  I'm uniformly worried. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  And I think there is some possibility to overcome it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  But I think that's going to require the president to reverse these China tariffs and other really [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=148.08s)]
*  high tariffs pretty quickly. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=152.72s)]
*  If that doesn't happen, I think for sure you're going to get a much worse May jobs report [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=154.84s)]
*  and the GDP numbers will really start to reflect weakness in the economy. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=159.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=163.72s)]
*  Let's move, Yamiche, to the jobs report and China considering trade talks. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=165.2s)]
*  I mean, both good news for the administration. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=168.48s)]
*  In fact, there was even a rainbow over President Trump's Florida golf club after the job report [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=170.0s)]
*  came out. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=174.6s)]
*  But overall, how's the White House reacting? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=175.6s)]
*  Well, the White House is calling this newest jobs report a boom, saying that it's a positive [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=177.76s)]
*  sign that they believe President Trump's economic plans, chaotic and inconsistent as they may [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=183.56s)]
*  be, are working for the American people. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=188.12s)]
*  The president was also out today posting online. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=190.72s)]
*  He said, in part, we're in a transition stage just getting started. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=193.32s)]
*  Consumers have been waiting for years to see pricing come down, no inflation. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=197.48s)]
*  The Fed should lower its rates. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=201.08s)]
*  And I should tell you, when I talk to White House officials, they do believe that the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=202.84s)]
*  Fed cutting rates could help the economy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=205.68s)]
*  Of course, the president has been going after the Fed chair for a while now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=208.28s)]
*  But I also want to talk about the fact that this is all coming amid this escalating trade [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=212.0s)]
*  war, which is part of the reason why we're seeing prices fluctuate in these ways. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=216.16s)]
*  Now, I want to read to you some of the statements that have come out that are really showing [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=219.6s)]
*  that there is some movement between the talks between China and the U.S. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=222.52s)]
*  The National Security Council said today we are in constant communications with Chinese [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=225.88s)]
*  officials through normal diplomatic channels. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=229.72s)]
*  And then China's Ministry of Commerce also said if the U.S. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=233.12s)]
*  wants to negotiate, it should show its sincerity by preparing to take actions in correcting [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  its mistakes and cancelling the unilateral tariffs. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=240.4s)]
*  Now, of course, President Trump has been saying that he is in constant communication with [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=243.0s)]
*  Chinese officials, but Chinese officials have been pushing back, pushing back, saying, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=246.96s)]
*  no, that's not true, that there are no negotiations happening. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=250.56s)]
*  And you can see in that statement, they're saying the U.S. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  needs to take more actions if they want to be at the negotiating table with China. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=255.48s)]
*  The other thing I want to point out is that even if these negotiations do start in earnest, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=259.32s)]
*  we have an idea for how long a trade deal could take. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  If we put it up for folks, 18 months to negotiate a trade deal is average and 45 months to actually [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=266.36s)]
*  implement that trade deal. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=272.52s)]
*  So what we're talking about here is long term negotiations. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=273.52s)]
*  But also, this could be a long time before American consumers see some sort of relief [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=276.24s)]
*  and change in the tariff war here. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=280.64s)]
*  Alex? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=282.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=283.76s)]
*  Those are some stunning numbers right there. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=284.76s)]
*  So I'm going to go to you now, Courtney. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=286.08s)]
*  So talk about the now closed loophole on low price Chinese goods. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=287.52s)]
*  And particularly given what she was just reporting, Yamiche, what are U.S. consumers in for? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=292.76s)]
*  And why was this in there in the first place? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=297.88s)]
*  I think the Trump administration has had on its mind. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=302.36s)]
*  It's idea to close this de minimis loophole, which allowed goods that were worth $800 or [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  less into the country tariff free. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=312.24s)]
*  It is what they call a way to crack down on fentanyl. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=314.88s)]
*  But I think when it comes to U.S. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  consumers, I think they very much see it as a direct attack on some of the retail items [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=322.0s)]
*  they can bring over from China for reduced prices. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=327.84s)]
*  Think about Shien. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=334.68s)]
*  Think about Tmoo. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the orders from these companies, from U.S. consumers, have absolutely skyrocketed [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  in recent years. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  And I want to point out, it's not just U.S. consumers. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=343.88s)]
*  There are some businesses that bring goods over in small amounts. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=346.24s)]
*  I'm talking about the smallest businesses. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=350.68s)]
*  And they're affected by this, too. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  So I think it's a little bit of a double whammy, hitting the consumer who's used to kind of, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=355.56s)]
*  you know, gorging on cheaper goods for China for clothing and other items, but also small [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=362.68s)]
*  businesses that are bringing in smaller amounts of inputs for products, whether they produce [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=368.56s)]
*  it here or not. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=374.04s)]
*  But Courtney, if Yamiche's reporting is true, if that's what turns out to be correct, those [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=377.04s)]
*  numbers, 18 months to potentially negotiate with China if it's already underway and getting [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=381.24s)]
*  going, which it doesn't appear to be yet. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=386.08s)]
*  45 months to implement the reduction of tariffs and turn everything around. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=388.24s)]
*  That just means everybody's going to pay a lot more for the duration of this, right? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  That assumes that President Trump or the White House does not blink. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=401.08s)]
*  I know those numbers from Apollo are shocking. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  I spoke to a source who said that if you tally up how much time it would take for President [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=409.64s)]
*  Trump to negotiate bilateral trade deals with everyone on the reciprocal trade list, I mean, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=415.96s)]
*  it's a long time. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=421.88s)]
*  I think we heard Treasury Secretary Scott Besson tell a reporter roundtable that I was [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=424.12s)]
*  sitting in a week ago that maybe tariffs can come down even if there aren't fully formed [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=430.2s)]
*  trade deals. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=437.88s)]
*  Maybe there is a framework of a deal that would allow tariffs to come down. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=439.2s)]
*  I think the big question is we don't know. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=444.36s)]
*  That's what's weighing on consumers. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=447.6s)]
*  That's what's weighing on businesses. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=449.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=450.64s)]
*  Time to get to you now, my friend Jeff. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=451.64s)]
*  The president released his budget plan today. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=453.2s)]
*  It is mostly a symbolic wish list. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=455.44s)]
*  What does it tell us about his economic priorities? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=457.72s)]
*  Well, a couple of things. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  It tells us that he wants to increase defense spending and he wants to reduce spending on [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=462.6s)]
*  things like child care and other social programs. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=466.36s)]
*  It's a blueprint for an action that he's actually already put into place, largely trying to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=470.44s)]
*  codify some of the things that he has done with DOJ, the so-called Department of Government [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=477.23999999999995s)]
*  Efficiency, cutting out programs, cutting out funding for things that he does not support, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=481.96s)]
*  but putting his money and his support behind defense and other areas that are very typically [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=487.96s)]
*  Republican wish list and Republican priorities. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=496.91999999999996s)]
*  I do want to just tack back to your last question, though, if you'll let me, Alex, with regard [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=500.44s)]
*  to the trade talks, and this is, I guess, related to the budget in some ways as well. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=504.68s)]
*  Yes, 18 months for negotiations with China or any country, that's a typical amount of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=509.52000000000004s)]
*  time, but the president can decide today, the president can decide tomorrow that he [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=515.84s)]
*  wants to take those tariffs down. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  And that will have an almost immediate impact on financial markets and on probably on the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=522.72s)]
*  broader economy as well. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=527.32s)]
*  It's the fact that the White House has decided that's not what it wants. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=528.92s)]
*  It wants to have talks. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=532.0s)]
*  It wants to have a deal with China that is A, leading to this uncertainty and B, leading [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=533.0s)]
*  to this longer timeline. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=537.92s)]
*  But the power is in the president's hands to make it as much quicker if he chose to [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=539.64s)]
*  do so. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=544.92s)]
*  And it might lift his poll numbers, Jeff, because just 36 percent of people approved [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=545.92s)]
*  of Trump's handling of the economy in the latest Reuters Ipsos poll. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=549.56s)]
*  I mean, that is the lowest it has been in either of his administrations. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=552.4799999999999s)]
*  Is it raising alarm bells inside the GOP? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=556.1999999999999s)]
*  It is. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=559.56s)]
*  I mean, that's the GOP is keeping its eyes on the midterm elections, which seem like [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=560.56s)]
*  a long ways away 2026. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=565.24s)]
*  But it's not that far. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=568.48s)]
*  People in Congress are already needing to start fundraising and thinking about their [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=570.16s)]
*  campaigns. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=573.72s)]
*  So, yeah, the president's popularity and the president's policies absolutely have a down [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=574.72s)]
*  ballot effect when it comes to Republicans running for reelection for the House, for [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=579.88s)]
*  the Senate, for the governorships and for other races and for other races next year. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=584.4s)]
*  Courtney, this report shocked me. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=589.24s)]
*  Twenty five percent of American families do not have the cash to buy basic food essentials. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=590.6800000000001s)]
*  They are now turning to buy now pay later programs at the grocery store. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=595.4s)]
*  Are these loans as troubling to you as they are to me? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=600.2s)]
*  I mean, if you're turning to them, does it suggest you have no other option? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=602.44s)]
*  I think what's really different about the 2020s versus the 2010s, you know, when we [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=607.32s)]
*  saw the global recession in 2008 is we all we have all these new indicators that might [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=612.32s)]
*  suggest that the consumer is struggling like buy now pay later. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=619.1600000000001s)]
*  I think I think we don't know it is is the consumer using buy now pay later because they [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=623.96s)]
*  don't have the cash in their bank account. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=628.6800000000001s)]
*  They don't have the cash on hand or are they like me and they're using buy now pay later [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=630.6800000000001s)]
*  because they're like, oh, cool. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=635.6800000000001s)]
*  I think we don't know, but I do think it's troubling that there is an increase in the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=637.76s)]
*  usage of these apps. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=642.92s)]
*  And just given the macro economic backdrop that we know consumers are feeling the pinch [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=645.16s)]
*  from surveys and what have you seeing that alongside an uptick in these apps. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=651.04s)]
*  I mean, it's cause for concern. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-MM0A4eO0&t=655.92s)]
