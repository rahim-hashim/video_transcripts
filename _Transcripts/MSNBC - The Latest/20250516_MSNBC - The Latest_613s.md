# 'Makes no sense': The only constant with Trump's trade policy is change
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI)
*  It is day 117 of the second Trump administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, President Trump is back in the U.S. after his trip to the Middle East, and he [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=4.72s)]
*  returns with some major investment announcements from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=8.4s)]
*  But he did not get the peace deals in Gaza and Ukraine he repeatedly promised during [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=13.64s)]
*  the campaign. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=18.16s)]
*  He's also backtracking on his promise to make 90 trade deals in 90 days. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=19.52s)]
*  Now the president says his administration will simply set the rates for tariffs for [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=24.54s)]
*  trading partners in coming weeks. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=28.4s)]
*  New data shows... [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  We have at the same time 150 countries that want to make a deal, but you're not able to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=32.28s)]
*  see that many countries. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  So at a certain point over the next two to three weeks, I think Scott and Howard will [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=39.96s)]
*  be sending letters out essentially telling people, it would be very fair, but we'll be [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=44.76s)]
*  telling people what they'll be paying to do business in the United States. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=49.36s)]
*  New data shows Americans are increasingly worried about how tariffs will affect them. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=56.82s)]
*  The University of Michigan's latest Consumer Sentiment Index hit its second lowest reading [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=61.78s)]
*  ever. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=66.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump was hoping to come home and find some progress on what he calls [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=67.5s)]
*  the one big beautiful bill containing his domestic agenda. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=71.62s)]
*  By the way, that's the actual name of that bill, but the bill didn't even make it out [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=75.3s)]
*  of the House committee today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=79.1s)]
*  Five Republicans joined with Democrats to block it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=80.82s)]
*  Those Republicans say there aren't enough spending cuts and it would add too much to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=83.7s)]
*  the deficit. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=88.26s)]
*  They aren't the only ones worried about America's growing debt. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=89.26s)]
*  Today, Moody's downgraded the United States credit rating because of that debt. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=92.18s)]
*  It's the first time Moody's has ever cut America's ratings. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  Other agencies have done so twice before during the debt ceiling fights in 2011 and 2003, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=100.54s)]
*  but it's the first time Moody's has done that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=106.58s)]
*  With that, let's bring in our lead panel. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=108.9s)]
*  Lace Brown joins us. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=111.78s)]
*  He's a columnist and editor for MSNBC Daily. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=112.78s)]
*  Akayla Gardner, a White House correspondent for Bloomberg. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=115.38000000000001s)]
*  And John Allen, senior national politics reporter for NBC. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=118.02000000000001s)]
*  Welcome to all of you. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=121.66000000000001s)]
*  John, we should say co-author of the new book, Fight Inside the Wildest Battle for the White [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=122.66000000000001s)]
*  House. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=127.78s)]
*  I'm going to begin with Akayla. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=128.78s)]
*  You wrote today about Trump's new tactics on tariffs, why he's moving from dealmaking [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=130.3s)]
*  to basically unilaterally setting terms with our trading partners. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=135.70000000000002s)]
*  It sounds like he's basically saying, take it or leave it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=140.42s)]
*  If you want to take this up with me, give me a call and we'll see if that works. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=143.22s)]
*  But otherwise, this is the rate and you'll have to live with it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=146.38s)]
*  Well, there's really major questions about this now because this is essentially what [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=150.22s)]
*  the president did in April. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=155.14s)]
*  They put out this list of rates that they were going to apply to various countries and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=157.01999999999998s)]
*  then they pivoted and really made it seem as though they were going to have these, quote, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=161.5s)]
*  bespoke deals individualized for certain countries. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=164.98s)]
*  It certainly seems that's going to be the case for some countries still, places like [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=168.14s)]
*  Japan, South Korea, potentially Australia, others that are really major trading partners. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=171.7s)]
*  Mexico, Canada could also be on that list. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=177.82s)]
*  But it seems like the rest of these countries could potentially just receive a letter, as [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  Trump says, telling them what they expect them to pay. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=184.05999999999997s)]
*  There is one school of thought that says the baseline is going to be 10 percent across [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=187.22s)]
*  the board, potentially higher for some of those trading partners like China, who have [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  this really big and significant trading relationship with the United States. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=195.86s)]
*  But it really, again, brings back that huge issue with the administration of mixed singles. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=199.66000000000003s)]
*  What we can never really know which way the president is going to go. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=204.5s)]
*  And it seems to change from day to day. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=207.9s)]
*  And that is really giving anxiety to markets and frankly, a lot of these countries. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=209.66000000000003s)]
*  Akela, it seems like there's also a through line with making promises that he's having [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=213.46s)]
*  a hard time keeping. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  I mean, trying to cut these 90 deals in 90 days, the clock is not on his side on this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=218.42000000000002s)]
*  It seems like he's realizing that it's difficult to accomplish all that in just a 90 day period [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=223.94s)]
*  of time, three short months. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=229.42s)]
*  I mean, for the president in general, he wants to bring home these wins. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=230.98s)]
*  We talked about Gaza, you talked about Ukraine. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=236.38s)]
*  I think you're starting to see some of that frustration really happening. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  And even with this bill today in Congress, you had him really going on true social, talking [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=242.18s)]
*  about those people who eventually voted against this bill, those dissenters. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=246.5s)]
*  He does not like anyone standing in his way, especially when it comes to campaign promises. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=250.9s)]
*  He really wants to come back, come midterms, ready to have a list of things that he accomplished [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=255.18s)]
*  and that he promised to accomplish, frankly, on a very quick timeline that he has not been [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  able to deliver at this point in the administration. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=264.6s)]
*  Hayes, this is another change from the Trump administration on trade policy. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=266.94s)]
*  It's not the first. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=272.66s)]
*  According to The Washington Post, this White House has announced new or revised trade tariff [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=273.66s)]
*  policies more than 50 times. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=278.9s)]
*  That's nearly every other day. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=282.73999999999995s)]
*  How can the administration keep track of this? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=284.26s)]
*  How can we keep track of this? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=288.09999999999997s)]
*  We've never seen something like that before. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=289.97999999999996s)]
*  We haven't. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=291.78s)]
*  And it's what we have to remember. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=292.78s)]
*  This is an abuse of the powers that Congress has given the president. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  They have been trying to do this through the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=297.26s)]
*  I believe, and saying that there is an emergency with the trade. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=302.26s)]
*  We have to put these tariffs in place. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=306.28s)]
*  So trying to just unilaterally say this is how much you have to pay to import into this [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=308.06s)]
*  country. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=313.42s)]
*  The fact is there is no emergency. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=314.62s)]
*  You remember back when they first announced on Liberation Day last month all of these [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=316.58000000000004s)]
*  wild tariffs, the formula that they used makes no sense. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=321.46000000000004s)]
*  They are basically saying if there's any sort of trade deficit that does not skew our way, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=324.94s)]
*  then we will have tariffs on you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=329.38s)]
*  As we saw with the deal with the United Kingdom, there will still be that baseline 10 percent [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=331.14000000000004s)]
*  tariffs no matter what. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=337.86s)]
*  That is something that Trump wants, regardless of what it does economically. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=339.34000000000003s)]
*  It's something that he is convinced just makes sense. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=342.14000000000004s)]
*  So the White House has been changing its mind because there's no real basis for any of this, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=344.86s)]
*  except what does Trump say that the economy needs? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=349.82s)]
*  Tariffs. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=352.54s)]
*  We're going to figure out how to do that no matter what. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=353.54s)]
*  We're going to figure out how to do that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=355.34000000000003s)]
*  You've heard that phrase, you know, flying the plane while you're still building the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  plane. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=359.06s)]
*  That generally doesn't apply to our, you know, to the American economy. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=360.06s)]
*  And that's essentially what we're seeing here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=363.94s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=365.54s)]
*  We're seeing them fly by the seat of their pants. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=366.66s)]
*  They have no there is no real economic rationale. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=368.18s)]
*  And the ones that they have given are completely mixed. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=372.82s)]
*  Is it about building up the American industrial base or is this about correcting trade imbalances [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  or is this about making great deals? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=380.58000000000004s)]
*  It's trying to be everything at once. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  And so it is nothing. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=384.82000000000005s)]
*  John, I want to turn to that University of Michigan report on consumer sentiment going [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=385.82000000000005s)]
*  down if prices go up, but maybe only slightly, because that's what we're hearing that we [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=390.5s)]
*  won't see a significant increase. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=396.06s)]
*  Let's say something that was 30 dollars now becomes 35 dollars. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=397.78s)]
*  Even an incremental increase like that, will that start to have an effect on voters or [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=401.65999999999997s)]
*  does it matter at this point what the prices do because people already feel like the economy [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=406.9s)]
*  is soft and they no longer have confidence in it? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=411.38s)]
*  I absolutely think it matters what the prices do. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=414.94s)]
*  And you know, you say a difference of 30 dollars and 35 dollars into some set of Americans [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=418.09999999999997s)]
*  that doesn't make much of a difference. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=423.38s)]
*  But to a lot of them, you know, people who are getting by paycheck to paycheck, you know, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=424.61999999999995s)]
*  if you go to a grocery store one week and you're spending 100 dollars or 125 dollars [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=429.53999999999996s)]
*  for your family, for your meals, and all of a sudden that's up to 145 dollars, that's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=433.9s)]
*  a real hit for a lot of families in this country. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=438.82s)]
*  So it's not just the inflation that they've seen. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=441.82s)]
*  And by the way, inflation has slowed this year. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=444.21999999999997s)]
*  You know, Trump said he was going to eliminate it on day one, basically has not been eliminated. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=446.38s)]
*  The rate of inflation has slowed. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=450.46s)]
*  But all that means is that prices continue to go up at a slower rate. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=452.38s)]
*  And there's reason that consumers are concerned. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=455.97999999999996s)]
*  It's not just about the tariffs. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=458.82s)]
*  It's about the fact that every month things cost more than they used to. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=460.21999999999997s)]
*  But in addition to that, I think what Hayes was just talking about, the sort of mixed [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=464.53999999999996s)]
*  approach of the White House, it's not clear, I think, to most consumers that the White [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=468.41999999999996s)]
*  House really has a plan for what they are doing with these tariffs. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=472.46s)]
*  You know, one question is, you know, Hayes brought up, are we trying to build the industrial [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=476.5s)]
*  base? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=480.86s)]
*  So one question is, are we trying to block other products from coming into this country, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=481.1s)]
*  which is part of that long term manufacturing idea? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=485.74s)]
*  Are we trying to get revenue by bringing more products into the country with higher tariffs? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=489.02s)]
*  Because sometimes Trump says this is how he's going to pay for tax cuts. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=493.62s)]
*  It doesn't make a lot of sense to us and it doesn't make a lot of sense to consumers. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=496.78000000000003s)]
*  And I think that's what you're seeing in that sentiment. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=500.66s)]
*  And we should remind people that Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, says that they [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=503.5s)]
*  will probably have to increase their prices in coming weeks. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=507.62s)]
*  So that will impact people as well. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=510.06s)]
*  Hayes, I want to move to the Republican budget bill, which seems to be in a bit of trouble. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=512.74s)]
*  What's next for Speaker Mike Johnson? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=518.3s)]
*  Where is the room for compromise? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=520.18s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=521.9s)]
*  And I'm sure Speaker Johnson is asking himself that exact question tonight as we prepare. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=523.14s)]
*  They're trying to figure out how to get all sides on board before Sunday evening. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=527.98s)]
*  They have a new vote in the House budget committee, try to move the big, beautiful bill [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=533.22s)]
*  forward. The problem is that the two sides. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=536.7s)]
*  Are kind of diametrically opposed in what they want. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=540.14s)]
*  On the one hand, you have the hardliners who voted against the bill today who say the spending [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=542.42s)]
*  cuts don't go far enough. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=546.6199999999999s)]
*  They say that it is unbalanced. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=548.0999999999999s)]
*  It has a lot of the perks up front where you see the tax cuts up front, the the the MAGA baby [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=549.6999999999999s)]
*  accounts up front. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=556.2199999999999s)]
*  But then the tax thousand dollars for every child. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=557.78s)]
*  Exactly. And then the cuts come later on, like in twenty twenty eight, twenty twenty nine, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=560.5s)]
*  after Trump is out of office. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=566.3s)]
*  So that's part of the conservative side. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=568.0200000000001s)]
*  Then you have the moderate who are saying we know that if you cut as deeply as you want, that [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=570.74s)]
*  will hurt our voters, that will hurt our chances in our swing districts. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=575.38s)]
*  And we want to be reelected. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=578.1800000000001s)]
*  So we want to where Johnson finds a compromise on these two things is a great question, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=579.82s)]
*  especially when you consider once this bill passes and goes to the Senate, they have [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=585.26s)]
*  change they want to make, then has to go back to the House and then get votes all over [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=588.7s)]
*  again. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6q7wMXbYI&t=593.1400000000001s)]
