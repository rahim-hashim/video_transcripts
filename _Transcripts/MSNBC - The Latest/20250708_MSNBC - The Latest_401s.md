# Young women are working at near-record rates
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI)
*  Newly released data shows that young women are working at nearly record rates. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=0.0s)]
*  A study from the Hamilton Project looked at workforce participation of so-called prime-age men and women. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  And that research found young women now are more likely to work than the same age group years ago. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=10.3s)]
*  Nearly 78 percent of women in their 20s and 30s are working. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=16.2s)]
*  Interestingly, the opposite is true for men. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=20.0s)]
*  The study found that a small but growing share of prime-age men are actually taking on more of the caregiving work at home. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=22.5s)]
*  Some fascinating trends here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=29.5s)]
*  Joining us now to discuss, editor-at-large for the nonprofit news publication, the 19th, Erin Haines. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=30.8s)]
*  She's also an MSNBC political contributor. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=35.9s)]
*  Erin, I have to say when I was reading this piece in the 19th, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=38.1s)]
*  I was struck because I had done some work during the pandemic around the so-called she session [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=41.9s)]
*  that showed me women were stepping back from their work because they had now the onus of child care [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=47.1s)]
*  when those facilities were closed during the pandemic. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=53.3s)]
*  So I was a little bit heartened to see this data showing that more women are working now than before. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=55.7s)]
*  What were your takeaways here? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=61.2s)]
*  What did you see in these trends? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=62.5s)]
*  Allie, you're making such a good point. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=65.1s)]
*  You know, the 19th was really born in the pandemic and so much of what we saw was how the pandemic shaped women [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=66.7s)]
*  and their role in the workforce and frankly, their refusal to go back to the status quo because of so many of the lessons [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=73.6s)]
*  that they learned that I think are important to reflect on five years later, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=79.5s)]
*  I mean, this research is fascinating, shared with the 19th and really shown for the first time [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=82.4s)]
*  that more young men than ever before are staying home to care for family. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=89.0s)]
*  This is a generational reset, right? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=92.7s)]
*  I mean, I'm old enough to have a parent who six decades ago was living in a world where women could still be fired from a job [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=94.7s)]
*  if they got married. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=103.10000000000001s)]
*  Almost all sole breadwinners were men, but that is not the case today. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=104.10000000000001s)]
*  And it really is a generational reset on who works, who cares and have a really defining success. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think it is fascinating the way that that traditional, you could call it 1950s mindset is shifting [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=116.1s)]
*  where both parents can be out in the workforce and heteronormative couples. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  But I also think that there is a piece of this that's out of necessity, right? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=125.6s)]
*  But then there's also the other piece of it that especially rebuilding the workforce after COVID, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=129.9s)]
*  teleworking can really help women stay engaged in the workforce after they have children because usually that's an inflection point, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=134.7s)]
*  Talk about the factors that this research shows allow women to stay active and engaged to the levels that they are right now. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=141.7s)]
*  Well, you are making a really good point. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean, in a lot of ways, this is definitely a sign of progress, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=150.9s)]
*  But we do have to point out that not all of what is driving women into the workforce is a desire to be at work, right? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=153.5s)]
*  I mean, you have this remote flex advantage in our story. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=158.5s)]
*  We talk about how a third of mothers with young children work remotely at least part time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=161.8s)]
*  Some are even working full time remotely. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=165.9s)]
*  More fathers are also doing the same. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  But economic necessity and desire is a real thing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  Women are stepping into the workforce, not just out of choice, but also out of need. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=172.9s)]
*  We know that this is especially true for women of color. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=176.9s)]
*  The cost of living is climbing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  Caregiving, as I know, I don't have to tell a lot of people watching here, is not inexpensive. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=183.0s)]
*  But also, again, coming out of the pandemic, the importance of caregiving, the role of caregiving and the burden of caregiving, quite frankly, has become a lot more visible. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=189.8s)]
*  But it's also become a lot more supported. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=198.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think child care is such a central piece of this because when I look at this study, yes, I think it shows progress that women are able to stay and sustain in the workforce at greater rates than their mothers before them, especially if they are desiring to be part of that workforce. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=200.3s)]
*  I think the gender equity piece, even though it's only ticking up a little bit, is crucial when we talk about equity in caregiving relationships, again, for heteronormative couples. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=217.5s)]
*  But when I see these numbers, then I also think about, OK, a child care system that was already under strain is clearly going to be that way going forward. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=227.8s)]
*  Right. I mean, that brings up a whole other set of issues. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=236.5s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, look, we do have to say the men's caregiving is on the rise. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=239.8s)]
*  Right. The percentage of men ages 25 to 34 not working because they're caregiving. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=243.4s)]
*  Caregivers has doubled since 2001. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=247.2s)]
*  So that is an important cultural shift that we do need to note. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=249.6s)]
*  So, and you've got high workforce participation, more equitable caregiving. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  That means opportunity for wage parity is growing, but you still got these costs and care barriers remaining. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=257.4s)]
*  So, you know, when women and men are in the workforce, women are in the workforce, men are caregiving, families are thriving. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=263.9s)]
*  And so does the economy. Like, this is good for our economy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=270.59999999999997s)]
*  But if we don't have policies like paid leave and child care, the process really does stay fragile. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=273.1s)]
*  So, I mean, I think while we are kind of watching this quiet revolution and work in gender to make it stick, we really need our systems to catch up with our values. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=278.5s)]
*  I mean, I know in this reconciliation bill, you know, child care was something that was on the agenda. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=287.5s)]
*  But, I mean, we're witnessing this generational realignment and we need our government. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=294.1s)]
*  We need our society to catch up with that. Women are reclaiming their economic power. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=298.7s)]
*  Men are stepping into these caregiving roles, but the system still has to catch up. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=302.1s)]
*  Yeah, flexing gender normative roles, I think, is such a key part of this story. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=307.3s)]
*  You know, the study explains some of why we see women being able to grow their numbers in the workforce. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=312.8s)]
*  Does it provide any explanations for why men might be changing their focus into caregiving? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=319.8s)]
*  I think that they're realizing that they are, it is important for them to be part of the equation, right? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=326.3s)]
*  Not to just make that household work, but really to make the economy work. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=333.2s)]
*  Like, women are able to participate more fully, not just in the workplace, but more fully in society when they do have help with that caregiving. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=338.2s)]
*  And so, you know, as these gender norms are changing, I think we are seeing some of that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=347.1s)]
*  But I think what this research points to is that this is an area right for even more exploration about how our households are changing and how this is just really not the workforce that our mothers and grandmothers were in. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=352.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's an absolutely fascinating study, especially for people like us who were so interested and fascinated with our reporting from the pandemic, the so-called she session. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=366.4s)]
*  Erin Haynes, a lot more for us to unpack here in the future, I'm sure. For now, we'll leave it there. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=375.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=379.79999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Sh7e0RirI&t=382.4s)]
