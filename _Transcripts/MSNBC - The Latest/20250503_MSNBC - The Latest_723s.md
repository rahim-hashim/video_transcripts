# Dems have gotten ‘lazy:’ Beto O’Rourke urges Dem leaders to fight against Trump’s agenda
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY)
*  The music is so good. Welcome back to the weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=0.0s)]
*  The backlash to President Trump's agenda is continuing to galvanize people across the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=4.08s)]
*  nation. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets on May Day, also known as International [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=8.6s)]
*  Workers Day, to protest against Trump's most extreme policies on immigration, the economy, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=13.92s)]
*  education. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Protesters in Tuscaloosa, Alabama also voiced their opposition to Trump's commencement speech [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=20.52s)]
*  at the University of Alabama, taking place the same day. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=25.8s)]
*  Our next two guests were among that chorus of voices, reminding us of the power of every [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=29.36s)]
*  single one of us has to enact change. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=34.16s)]
*  Every change in America has come from a movement. It has come from not from Washington, D.C., [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=40.32s)]
*  or even a state capital. Every change in this country has come from a movement that has [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=47.08s)]
*  bubbled up, and you've got to make your voices heard. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=51.96s)]
*  We are building public sentiment against which nothing can survive. So remember, you have [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=55.28s)]
*  the power, and we are grateful that you brought that power here today in Tuscaloosa. Let's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=64.28s)]
*  go out and share it with this country and win America back. Let's do this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=69.76s)]
*  Joining us now, former Congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas, founder of Powered by the People, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=76.36s)]
*  and former Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, a distinguished senior fellow at the Center [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=81.92s)]
*  for American Progress. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=86.68s)]
*  Gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. I guess my first question for you, let's start [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=87.88s)]
*  with you, Senator Jones, is this feels different, right? For weeks and weeks, people were saying, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=93.44s)]
*  where's the resistance? Where's the opposition? Where are people? Where are the people on [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=98.48s)]
*  the streets, and where are the leaders helping them to get there? What has changed in the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=102.28s)]
*  last couple of weeks for you guys? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=106.2s)]
*  You know, Eugene, I think people are just kind of feeling their voices, getting their [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=108.64s)]
*  footing a little bit. And I want to make one quick correction on you. Donald Trump didn't [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=112.52s)]
*  give a commencement address at the University of Alabama. Those exercises didn't start [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=117.56s)]
*  till the next day. He invited himself to Tuscaloosa and had to create an event in which they [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=121.88s)]
*  couldn't hardly get people to come to. They had to open it up to the general public at [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=127.76s)]
*  one point. So this, I think just even that was the backlash. The fact that the president [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=132.0s)]
*  had felt compelled to invite himself was not invited by the university. This was just [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=137.96s)]
*  kind of a small piece of what we're seeing across America. And I think people are getting [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=142.8s)]
*  their footing, and they're starting to see what's happening with due process. They're [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  starting to see what's happening with the cuts and how many times Trump is losing in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=151.32s)]
*  court. And that empowers people to get out to the streets and start this movement and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=155.68s)]
*  to keep it going. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, we obviously are seeing an uptick in protests and some people fighting [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=162.4s)]
*  back against the administration that has eluded us for the past 100 days. But it is a national [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=169.6s)]
*  movement that has not quite flowered yet, is how the New York Times puts it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=174.8s)]
*  Former Congressman O'Rourke, I want to ask you a little bit about this, but the opposition, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=180.56s)]
*  the Times writes, lacks a leader, a central message or shared goals beyond a rejection [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  of Mr. Trump, even as some Democrats become more aggressive. Their deeply unpopular party [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=190.0s)]
*  is struggling to articulate a unified line of attack. So what is the line of attack [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=194.76s)]
*  here and why can't Democrats get their act together? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=201.84s)]
*  The encouraging thing for me about what's going on and what we just saw in Tuscaloosa is [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=206.8s)]
*  that those students at the University of Alabama did not wait for the DNC or elected [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=212.16s)]
*  Democrats or really anyone else to tell them what to do. They took matters and our future [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=217.72s)]
*  into their own hands. They organized that protest. They invited Doug Jones and myself. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  They brought 1500 people out. And as you mentioned, we're seeing that all across the country. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=227.6s)]
*  And that's a great thing. In the opener, you had Doug Jones talking about the power is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  not with the president, it's not with the courts, it's not with the legislature. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=238.04s)]
*  As Lincoln said, public sentiment is everything. With it, nothing can fail. Without it, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=240.92s)]
*  nothing can succeed. And public sentiment, we're seeing it everywhere. We're seeing it in Waco, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=246.68s)]
*  Texas, where I was last week, in Denton, in Tulsa, everywhere. So I'm very encouraged. And out of [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=251.4s)]
*  that, I think you're going to see leaders emerge, maybe some from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, who will be [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=258.04s)]
*  running in 2026. And they will give those national elected leaders the message. And I believe the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=262.52s)]
*  message is we fight for you. But the challenge with that message is you can't just say it. You [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=269.4s)]
*  got to show it. And you got to show up everywhere and fight on every front. And that's why we were [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=274.6s)]
*  in Tuscaloosa this week. Senator Jones, to this point of public sentiment, and yet public sentiment, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=279.16s)]
*  according to the polls, the raff, the polls that came out last week shows that the public sentiment [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=285.56s)]
*  isn't exactly with the Democratic Party. NBC News poll shows that the Democratic Party's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=291.24s)]
*  unfavorable rating is at 60 percent. In all fairness, the unfavorable rating for the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=297.48s)]
*  Republican Party is 55 percent. But in a Washington Post poll that was out last week, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=301.88s)]
*  folks were asked the question, who do you feel is out of touch, President Trump, the Republican [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=307.56s)]
*  Party, or the Democratic Party? And 69 percent said that the Democratic Party was out of touch. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=313.24s)]
*  How does the party get that part of the public sentiment turned around? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=321.48s)]
*  You know, I think that one of the challenges Democrats have these days, Jonathan, is to make [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=328.44s)]
*  sure that we not only resist Trump, that we not only oppose this regime that we're seeing, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=333.32s)]
*  but that we offer a better vision for America. I think Democrats have failed to some extent on that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=338.68s)]
*  In trying to reach people exactly where they are, understand that in today's world, all politics is [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=345.48s)]
*  not local. All politics is personal. And that means personal for them and their communities. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=351.56s)]
*  And we've got to talk to people and understand that that's where they are. But governing and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=357.0s)]
*  governing efficiently. You know, look, this past week was like the 14th anniversary of an incredible [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=362.04s)]
*  wrath of tornadoes that brought death and destruction across America. Tuscaloosa and people [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=367.72s)]
*  in Alabama rebuilt. We never asked for what's happening any more than the people of Tuscaloosa [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=373.72s)]
*  asked for that tornado. We're not asked for what's happening now, the destruction of our government [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=379.32s)]
*  and our institutions of government. But we've got opportunities to rebuild, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=384.04s)]
*  and we need to take those opportunities and we need to tell the American people [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=387.96000000000004s)]
*  exactly how we're going to do it and how we're going to make it more efficient and responsible [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=391.56s)]
*  to what they believe is an appropriate response for government. That's what Democrats can do. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  It's a two-step process, and we're going to start working on that very soon. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  You talked about how this is kind of a grassroots effort that they called you guys and invited you. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=405.40000000000003s)]
*  They're not waiting on the DNC. They're not waiting on the D-Trip or even you guys or [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=412.2s)]
*  any organizations to get this stuff started. But I'm curious how do you sustain that, right? Because [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=416.2s)]
*  that kind of energy is, what are we in, month four of the administration? We have quite a bit [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=421.64s)]
*  of time to go before the midterms and before 2028. And so what does it look like to sustain [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=428.52s)]
*  this energy? Because that feels like a lot of that's going to fall on the shoulders [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=434.2s)]
*  of leaders of the party like yourself and the Senator here. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=438.36s)]
*  I really believe you got to show up everywhere. You got to fight on every front, and you got to be [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=443.56s)]
*  there for every single community that is under attack. I think our party, unfortunately, has [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=447.96000000000004s)]
*  gotten lazy and overly enamored of seven so-called battleground or blue wall states to the detriment [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=453.64s)]
*  of Alabama and Mississippi and Texas and Louisiana. I mean, those are our fellow Americans too, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=461.08000000000004s)]
*  and I don't blame them for saying, hey, the Democratic Party has not been showing up for me, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=467.0s)]
*  listening to me, fighting for me. So when this pollster asks whether the Democratic [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=471.24s)]
*  Party represents my values, what the hell do you expect me to say? So when we show up and listen [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=475.16s)]
*  and reflect back what we're hearing, I think we're going to engender the support and the enthusiasm [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=480.68s)]
*  that we need. But the leaders that we have in place right now with some exceptions, including [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=485.8s)]
*  present company, they're just not getting the job done. And so again, I'm optimistic and encouraged [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=491.56s)]
*  by people who are taking matters into their own hands. They're organizing these protests and these [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=496.84s)]
*  marches. And we know from American history, whether it was John Lewis at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=501.24s)]
*  1965 or our pushback against family separation in 2018, that public sentiment, the power of people [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=505.96s)]
*  can change what presidents can do and make this country better. And so it's going to be tough, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=513.48s)]
*  but we are going to get through this and we're going to be all the better for it, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=518.68s)]
*  thanks to the people of America. Just really quickly, you said that the leadership basically [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=521.88s)]
*  wasn't getting the job done. So should people like Chuck Schumer or Hacking Jeffy, should they step [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=526.92s)]
*  down from leadership? You know, when you look at Chuck Schumer, just as a specific example, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=531.3199999999999s)]
*  and you had that continuing resolution, that government funding bill, which is really just [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=536.92s)]
*  a giveaway to Elon Musk and Donald Trump after they had decimated government agencies, illegally [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=541.0799999999999s)]
*  impounded to congressionally authorized and appropriated funds, every member of the House, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=547.64s)]
*  Democratic side stood strong, but for one, Chuck Schumer signaled he was going to do the same [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=552.36s)]
*  and then lost the only leverage we had, that unity, and surrendered to Trump and Musk. The battle [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=557.08s)]
*  line in a Democratic party right now is not between moderates and progressives. It's between those [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=563.64s)]
*  who are going to fight and those who are going to surrender. And if you're not willing to fight, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=567.96s)]
*  get out of the way and allow someone to step up who will. Senator Jones, in that vein, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=571.56s)]
*  who do you consider to be the de facto leader of the Democratic party? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=577.8s)]
*  Oh, I think there's a lot of leaders across the party. I think, you know, you can't point to one [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=581.56s)]
*  national leader at this point. I think you're looking at seeing a lot of governors push back. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=585.96s)]
*  You're looking at a lot of former members of Congress like Beto who are pushing back. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=590.36s)]
*  I think he, Beto had the right tone a few minutes ago and he said, look, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=595.88s)]
*  this is a movement in which leaders are going to emerge. We will see that. And it's not just fiery [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=600.12s)]
*  rhetoric. It's getting things done. It is making sure people understand and getting the messages [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=605.8s)]
*  out there. Showing up, as Beto said, showing up and making sure people are heard. That's the thing [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=610.76s)]
*  people are looking for now. As much as anything, they want people to show up and listen and to make [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=616.28s)]
*  sure their voices are carried. This is going to take a little time. This is not something you can [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=622.12s)]
*  you can just snap your fingers and all of a sudden pop, there's a leader, you know, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=627.0s)]
*  popping in the door. That's just not the case. This is going to take a little bit of time, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=630.52s)]
*  but I think what you're seeing in this first 100 days is that now those leaders are starting [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=635.08s)]
*  to get their voices. They're starting to emerge and they're starting to learn lessons that are [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=640.36s)]
*  coming from the American people. Real quickly, Congressman Warwick, I take the senator's point. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=644.9200000000001s)]
*  It'll take a little time, but should should national Democrats get used to the fact that [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=650.2s)]
*  they're not in the driver's seat and that this is coming from the ground up? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=655.96s)]
*  Yeah, and that's a great thing. You know, again, I think so much of our misfortune can be tied not [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=661.0s)]
*  to Donald Trump, not to the Republicans, not to the MAGA movement, but to Democrats being lazy and [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=666.8399999999999s)]
*  focusing on consultants and polls and focus groups and message testing instead of being with the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=671.7199999999999s)]
*  people that you want to serve. And you can't just be with them in Pennsylvania, Michigan and [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=677.56s)]
*  Wisconsin. You got to be with them in Tuscaloosa, Alabama and El Paso, Texas. And so that's what I'm [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=681.3199999999999s)]
*  seeing. And that's what's encouraging to me. And if the Democratic Party wants to be with them, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=686.1999999999999s)]
*  wants to win, they're going to listen to those people who right now are showing the leadership [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=690.6s)]
*  that this country so desperately needs. Former Congressman Beto O'Rourke and former Senator [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=695.24s)]
*  Doug Jones, thank you both very much. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhAJQ7xvNGY&t=700.76s)]
