# ‘A lot of incompatibilities’: Musk exits Trump’s White House, says DOGE will go on
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo)
*  The man who came to Washington to blow up the way government operates is gone today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=0.0s)]
*  129 days after Elon Musk promised to end the tyranny of bureaucracy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=5.0s)]
*  The world's richest man posted on X, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=11.0s)]
*  as my scheduled time as a special government employee comes to an end, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=13.0s)]
*  I would like to thank President Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=17.0s)]
*  The Doge mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=22.0s)]
*  But Musk's stint as the president's self-described first buddy came at a cost, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=27.0s)]
*  personally with his company SpaceX and Tesla, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=32.0s)]
*  seeing their brand reputations plummet, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=35.0s)]
*  and of course for the thousands of federal employees who got the axe. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=37.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Teddy Schleifer, New York Times reporter and MSNBC contributor, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=41.0s)]
*  and former Republican congressman of Florida, Carlos Garbello, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=46.0s)]
*  an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=49.0s)]
*  Teddy, in your new article about Musk, you write that he's leaving Washington disillusioned. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=51.0s)]
*  I mean, we already heard him speak against Donald Trump's tax and spending bill. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=56.0s)]
*  What's his goal now? Is it just to go back and rebuild his companies, rebuild his reputation? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=61.0s)]
*  What's his game now? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=67.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think one of the most notable things about the way he's choreographing his exit is how public he's being, right? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=69.0s)]
*  I mean, he puts up this tweet last night, sort of, you know, offering a final message to the troops, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=76.0s)]
*  and he has done a series of kind of on-record interviews about his commitment to Tesla and SpaceX. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=82.0s)]
*  Some of these interviews have been at Tesla and SpaceX. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=88.0s)]
*  He clearly is at least attuned to the idea that he has been overextended on his political adventures, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=91.0s)]
*  and he wants to let shareholders know and investors know that he is back in charge at the companies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=100.0s)]
*  Does he think he's genuinely, from what we know, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=106.0s)]
*  Does he genuinely think he's been successful in his time in D.C.? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=109.0s)]
*  You know, his interviews have been pretty interesting, actually. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=114.0s)]
*  He has been candid about the fact that he's not been as successful as he thought. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=117.0s)]
*  You know, he has said that the bureaucracy was more entrenched than he believed. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=121.0s)]
*  You know, he has spoken, obviously, about his frustrations with the budget bill, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=126.0s)]
*  and he's sort of blaming not Trump, but blaming Republicans on Capitol Hill. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=131.0s)]
*  I mean, obviously, this is a very self-serving explanation, right? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=136.0s)]
*  It's like, I couldn't accomplish everything I wanted to because things are hard, essentially, is the argument. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=139.0s)]
*  You know, I think Elon might have been judged more favorably if he had had smaller ambitions. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=146.0s)]
*  I mean, remember, he was talking about cutting $2 trillion from the yearly budget. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=153.0s)]
*  I mean, what if he had gone out there and said in November 2024 that he only wants to cut $100 billion? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=158.0s)]
*  Then we might be sitting here saying, well, Musk has cut $150 billion. Good job. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=165.0s)]
*  I feel like to some extent he was a victim of kind of his own expectation setting. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=170.0s)]
*  So, Congressman, next week the president is expected to send, what is it, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=174.0s)]
*  more than $9 billion in Doge cuts to Congress to try to make them permanent. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=179.0s)]
*  Does he have a permanent impact? What do you think the long-term impact of Doge will be? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=184.0s)]
*  Look, I think that he did make a difference. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=191.0s)]
*  Obviously, he put a spotlight on government efficiency and on ways that the federal government could be improved. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=195.0s)]
*  The way he did it obviously was unpopular and controversial. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=202.0s)]
*  Well, did he improve it, I guess, is the more important question, right? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=205.0s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=208.0s)]
*  A lot of people have been saying for a long time that government could be more efficient, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=210.0s)]
*  so it's not like he reinvented the wheel there. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=214.0s)]
*  Right. At the end of the day, time will tell whether or not he was effective in what he set out to do. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=216.0s)]
*  But what I'll say, Chris, is that this — it's not — I wouldn't call it a divorce, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=223.0s)]
*  but this kind of parting of ways between Elon Musk and Donald Trump isn't a big surprise [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=228.0s)]
*  because Elon Musk is actually more of a classic small-government conservative [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=233.0s)]
*  who believes in reforming government, cutting government. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=238.0s)]
*  He's in favor of finding savings in programs like Social Security and Medicare. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=241.0s)]
*  That is not what the president's movement is about. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=247.0s)]
*  The president's very close to unions. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=251.0s)]
*  Elon Musk is a union skeptic. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=254.0s)]
*  The president believes in tariffs. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=256.0s)]
*  Elon Musk does not believe in tariffs. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=258.0s)]
*  So there are a lot of incompatibilities between Elon Musk and the president and his movement, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=261.0s)]
*  and I think that's one of the big reasons why they're kind of parting ways right now. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=267.0s)]
*  Well, do we have a good sense of what the relationship is right now, Teddy? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=271.0s)]
*  I mean, is it a divorce? Is it a temporary separation? Is it a conscious uncoupling? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=274.0s)]
*  What is the relationship? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=280.0s)]
*  I don't think it's that bad. You know, I mean, I think the relationship is good. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=283.0s)]
*  It is probably not as electric or euphoric as things were in those kind of heady days of November 2024 [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=288.0s)]
*  when Musk was at Mar-a-Lago all the time. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=296.0s)]
*  I mean, from our understanding and reporting, you know, Trump and Musk still have a good relationship. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=299.0s)]
*  They still talk a lot, though, you know, and I wouldn't discount the possibility [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=303.0s)]
*  that Musk remains more involved than we think he's going to be. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=307.0s)]
*  You know, again, he's really trying to lean into this public messaging [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=311.0s)]
*  about, you know, the divorce or however he wants to put it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=317.0s)]
*  But, you know, I think Trump would still call Elon Musk probably a lot over the next couple of years. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=322.0s)]
*  Teddy Schleifer, former Congressman Carlos Scarbello. More to come on this. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=328.0s)]
*  I don't think we've heard the last. Thank you both so much. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=333.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplEzdgcuIo&t=346.0s)]
