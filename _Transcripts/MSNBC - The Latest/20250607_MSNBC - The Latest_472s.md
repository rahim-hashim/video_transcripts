# Xi ‘holds the cards’ after Trump ‘shot before he aimed’ with tariffs: National security expert
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU)
*  Joining me now, former Obama White House Deputy National Security Advisor and MSNBC political [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=0.0s)]
*  contributor Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=4.92s)]
*  Welcome back, Ben. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=6.92s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=7.92s)]
*  So let's talk about the expectations for Monday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=8.92s)]
*  You have U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Besson, who said only a conversation between Trump [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=10.88s)]
*  and Chinese, rather China's Xi Jinping, could solve the differences. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=15.6s)]
*  So how much do these talks matter? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=19.72s)]
*  And does China have a fundamental advantage in this trade war? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=22.8s)]
*  The talks always matter at the leader level with the Chinese, because Xi Jinping is the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=28.7s)]
*  ultimate decision-maker in China. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=32.86s)]
*  That's normal. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=35.14s)]
*  These matter even more, because on the U.S. side, there are multiple policies happening [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=36.5s)]
*  at once. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=41.14s)]
*  You've got people like Scott Besson, who clearly wants to kind of calm the markets down, clearly [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=42.379999999999995s)]
*  wants to kind of unwind the trade war that his boss started. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=46.3s)]
*  But then you've got all kinds of Trump advisors who are spoiling for a fight, who want to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=49.16s)]
*  escalate things. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=52.94s)]
*  And so I think what Xi Jinping wants to do, and I think he's been quite firm with Trump, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=54.2s)]
*  and Trump seems to have a lot of affection for Xi Jinping as a strongman. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=57.7s)]
*  Xi Jinping wants to say, look, let's just calm this down. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=63.46s)]
*  You need to rein in your more escalatory, if not crazy, advisors. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=66.02000000000001s)]
*  I also think, Xi Jinping, to your question, Alex, is holding a lot of cards here, because [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=72.02000000000001s)]
*  in addition to the fact that the global markets are being disrupted, and that led to a lot [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=77.18s)]
*  of Trump supporters putting pressure on him to unwind these tariffs, China has restricted [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=81.30000000000001s)]
*  the export of what are called rare earth materials that they have a massive global monopoly on [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=85.94s)]
*  to the U.S. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=91.7s)]
*  And U.S. manufacturing can't really work without these inputs from the Chinese. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=92.7s)]
*  So I think Trump didn't, you know, he shot before he aimed in this trade war. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=97.66s)]
*  China has a lot of leverage here, and they're trying to use it to just turn the dial back [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=103.22s)]
*  down. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=108.02000000000001s)]
*  Okay, but good to know these talks on Monday. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=109.02000000000001s)]
*  They're important. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=111.18s)]
*  We'll be watching that closely. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=112.18s)]
*  Let's go on to Iran now, Ben, because the Trump administration has proposed an interim [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=113.38s)]
*  arrangement allowing Iran to continue enriching uranium while a plan is being worked out to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=117.42s)]
*  block Iran's path to a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=123.1s)]
*  This is according to two sources with knowledge of the matter, as well as two foreign diplomats. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  Under this proposal, the U.S. will assist building uranium enrichment facilities managed [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=130.9s)]
*  by a consortium of Arab nations, which will provide nuclear fuel to Iran for non-nuclear [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=135.9s)]
*  purposes only. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=142.38s)]
*  You Ben helped craft the Obama administration's Iran deal, which Trump tore up. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=144.82s)]
*  Is this a viable compromise, and does it buy more time for diplomacy, perhaps? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=149.82s)]
*  Yeah, it buys time for diplomacy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=154.9s)]
*  Clearly, the Trump people want a deal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=157.98s)]
*  They want this kind of off their plate. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=160.82s)]
*  They don't want the risk of a nuclear armed Iran or the risk of an Israeli strike on Iran [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=162.34s)]
*  that could start a much wider regional war. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=167.22s)]
*  The irony of all this, Alex, of course, is that we had a nuclear deal in place. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=170.66s)]
*  Trump pulled out of it because it was Obama's deal. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=174.52s)]
*  What the Iranians want is they want to maintain some kind of domestic nuclear program, some [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  kind of domestic enrichment capacity. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  That means there are centrifuges spinning inside of Iran that are enriching uranium [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  for nuclear purposes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=187.4s)]
*  If they can have that capability, you can have a deal. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=189.52s)]
*  That's what essentially happened in the Obama years. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=192.8s)]
*  They shipped all their fuel out. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  They took out a bunch of those centrifuges and put them under storage. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=195.88s)]
*  They're inspections. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  If the Trump people can get comfortable with the Iranians having some minimal capability, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=200.4s)]
*  not for weapons purposes, for medical purposes, other energy purposes, then I think you can [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=205.4s)]
*  get a deal. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=210.16s)]
*  This is kind of a bridge, and they want to test whether the Iranians will let go of a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=211.16s)]
*  program entirely if they can kind of get fuel from somewhere else. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=215.56s)]
*  I don't know that the Iranians will agree to that, which is partially why this is being [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=219.24s)]
*  proposed as an interim step. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  The Trump people have to come to terms with the fact that their own hardliners are not [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=224.12s)]
*  going to get what they want from the Iranians and get a deal because Iran is not going to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=227.06s)]
*  agree to having no nuclear program. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=230.98s)]
*  So once again, they're kind of buying time for their own internal policy contradictions [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=232.82s)]
*  here. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=236.74s)]
*  What they've said they want is not what they're going to be able to get, but they, I think, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=237.74s)]
*  like are trying to get to the place where they can say yes to the Iranians. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=241.86s)]
*  And you have Vladimir Putin, who told President Trump on their phone call this week he's interested [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=245.18s)]
*  in participating in the Iran negotiations. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=248.74s)]
*  He says he could help bring the deal to a quick close. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=251.02s)]
*  Moscow certainly has ties, close ones, with Tehran. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=254.02s)]
*  Would Putin help negotiations or would he just complicate matters further? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=257.42s)]
*  I mean, he was obviously involved in the last Iran deal, involved Russia and China and the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=261.98s)]
*  Europeans, and they could be helpful in certain things, like if the Iranians are shipping [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=267.26s)]
*  their nuclear fuel out of the country, which is what they did in the last deal, that you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=271.92s)]
*  want that fuel out so they don't have fuel to build a bomb, Russia could help ship that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=276.38s)]
*  or Russia could take that onto their soil. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=281.7s)]
*  They could help in that kind of way. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=284.06s)]
*  But the reality here, frankly, Alex, is I think Putin is trying to appeal to Trump, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=286.82s)]
*  leader to leader, look at the kind of ways in which we can cooperate. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=292.41999999999996s)]
*  If you just kind of look the other way and let me do what I'm doing in Ukraine or if [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=295.38s)]
*  you continue to pressure the Ukrainians to make all the concessions that I want in terms [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=299.18s)]
*  of territory and in terms of their future relationship with the United States. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=304.3s)]
*  So I don't think the price like what Putin could deliver in this deal is worth it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=307.96s)]
*  But Trump, I think, is susceptible to that kind of appeal from Putin. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=313.88s)]
*  He should be focused on ending the war in Ukraine by putting some pressure on Putin [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=317.56s)]
*  instead of trying to build some larger cooperative agenda. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=321.12s)]
*  He doesn't need to do that to conclude an Iran deal. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  Ben, speaking of that Putin phone call, after it, the White House said an immediate peace [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=327.47999999999996s)]
*  deal with Russia and Ukraine isn't going to happen. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  Trump later compared the two countries to two young children who hate each other and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=335.56s)]
*  said it might be better to let them fight for a while before pulling them apart. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=339.0s)]
*  This is after Trump's increasing frustration with Putin on this topic, suggesting that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=344.12s)]
*  he might pressure him into ending the war. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=348.48s)]
*  Does the ambivalence of Trump's comments suggest he's not willing to punish Putin? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=351.6s)]
*  I mean, does he not fundamentally understand Putin's obsession to conquer Ukraine? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=356.32s)]
*  He clearly either doesn't understand or doesn't care, Alex. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  And his description is kind of pointless. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=366.04s)]
*  He keeps trying to talk about Russia and Ukraine like he would talk about political adversaries [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=368.62s)]
*  at a campaign rally. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  This is the real world in which there is a war going on that has killed or wounded hundreds [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=376.18s)]
*  and hundreds of thousands of people and imperils Ukraine's survival and European security. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  And the reality is the only person that Trump has meaningfully pressured for the last few [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  months is President Zelensky. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=390.76s)]
*  He's the one that has had to make concessions to Trump. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=393.32s)]
*  He's the one that agreed to a 30 day ceasefire, which Putin would not agree to. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=395.90000000000003s)]
*  He's the one who agreed to fly to Istanbul to meet with Putin, which Putin would not [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=400.0s)]
*  do. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=403.32s)]
*  He's the one who's had to worry about whether the U.S. is going to cut off the support that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=404.32s)]
*  his nation depends upon. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=407.2s)]
*  And so, of course, during that period, we saw Russia escalate the war. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=409.36s)]
*  Before the Ukrainians did that operation in Russia, you saw the largest drone attacks [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=414.56s)]
*  from Russia. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=418.44s)]
*  You saw the missile strikes on Kiev. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=420.2s)]
*  You saw the Russians escalate. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=420.76s)]
*  All Trump's diplomacy has done thus far is actually escalate the war and empower Russia. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=422.56s)]
*  And so now for him to say, maybe I'm going to walk away. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=429.16s)]
*  Well, if he walks away without providing significant additional military support to Ukraine, walking [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=431.96s)]
*  away is a gift to Vladimir Putin. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9jnbFd8lU&t=437.32s)]
