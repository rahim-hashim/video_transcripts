# NOW: Conclave begins to choose new Pope
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho)
*  And I'm just pausing to listen for a moment because it looks like they've now completed the oath and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=0.0s)]
*  There was an announcement of such and now we see some of the people here leaving [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=6.66s)]
*  So that just left behind will be the Cardinals [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  Claudia walk us through who these people are who are leaving and how [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=16.06s)]
*  We expect this to all unfold now and we see of course the the Vatican guards. They're ready as well [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=20.18s)]
*  Oh [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=25.7s)]
*  That's right [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=27.7s)]
*  I don't know everyone who's not involved in the actual election needs to leave the Sistine Chapel and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=28.34s)]
*  Just as we saw at the last Cardinal swear the oath [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=34.58s)]
*  I heard a big round of applause that right behind me in st. Peter's Square [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  Because there's a lot of people actually watching this [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=44.0s)]
*  Percent what this this moment this historic moment on maxi screens in st. Peter's Square [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=47.14s)]
*  So now everybody is leaving and after and after the the Cardinal electors are left inside [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=52.339999999999996s)]
*  They will close the doors, but before the closing of the doors [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=57.98s)]
*  There will be the famous phrase pronounced the extra omnes that is Latin for everyone out [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=62.26s)]
*  And then we'll see those doors closing and from that moment on [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=68.78s)]
*  The Cardinal electors will be completely isolated from the world and they will have only one mission [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=72.74s)]
*  That is to elect the new Pope on earth [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=78.46s)]
*  Deborah's we watch this to the the Vatican Guard standby also known as the elite Swiss [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=82.26s)]
*  Guards who are watching there. Can you talk to us about the history of that? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=89.42s)]
*  Well the Swiss guards have had the role of protecting the Pope and generally it's very ceremonial [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=95.5s)]
*  but we need to think back in the 1500s when there was a sack of Rome and many lost their lives trying to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=100.7s)]
*  Protect the Pope so when push comes to shove and there's been a critical moment a dangerous moment in history [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=106.84s)]
*  They've had to actually give up their lives in order to protect the Pope so even if right now [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=112.72s)]
*  We're seeing them standing there. It's a very significant serious role [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=116.72s)]
*  This is a big moment right we're about to see this conclave [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=124.64s)]
*  Begin those doors are about to close the Vatican guards [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=129.04s)]
*  Left behind to stand by outside that room. Let's just listen in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=133.68s)]
*  The [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=163.82s)]
*  Doors are closed [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=170.56s)]
*  And guided by or with the help of the Virgin Mary. I know being part of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=172.96s)]
*  The thinking and the history the theology of all of this [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=179.32s)]
*  Claudio do they go vote now? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, I just what I can tell you on it just it was another round of applause there in the square as soon as they saw those [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=188.72s)]
*  Doors closing because this is I mean this I've followed [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=194.72s)]
*  Three conclaves and it always sends shivers down my spine when I see this moment because it's so so historical [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  It's there's so much tradition behind this isn't that Deborah is it's like watching history unfold [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=203.92s)]
*  And even though it's always the same tradition. It just gets to you doesn't it? So right now [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  So right now [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  The that's it. We're not gonna see anything from and we're gonna know we're not gonna know anything of what's happening inside the Sistine Chapel [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=217.56s)]
*  Until we will see white smoke coming out and until we will see the new pope coming out of the balcony [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=225.64s)]
*  So there but I would what's happening right now is right now Claudio. What is happening? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=231.56s)]
*  Is that there will be a meditation the second one? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=235.64s)]
*  since the Pope has died of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  Cardinal Raniero Cantalamesa [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  He used to be the former preacher of the papal household and he will speak to the Cardinals gathered in that room about the very serious [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=243.44s)]
*  Responsibility they have in front of them in terms of being [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=251.36s)]
*  About who they should pick to lead the Catholic Church and who's the right individual for that? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=255.24s)]
*  So certainly that will take a little bit of time. So the voting probably wouldn't happen take place immediately [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=259.08s)]
*  But it'll certainly give them some food for thought and make them reflect about this [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=265.52s)]
*  decision before them [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=271.02s)]
*  Yeah, father just seeing those doors close. It was sort of a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=273.53999999999996s)]
*  Powerful moment. What what were you thinking? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=278.94s)]
*  I'm thinking right now of how they must be or a lot of them [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=282.82s)]
*  I mean I imagine the first thing that I would do if I were one of them is begin to pray [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=287.3s)]
*  Say, okay. Well, we've done our preparation and now it's kind of like it marks the beginning of a new phase in this whole [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=292.14s)]
*  This whole process this whole ritual and you know imagine sitting there and also thinking [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=299.38s)]
*  Of all the past conclaves and then some of those Cardinals have been in past conclave some this is their first one [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=305.46000000000004s)]
*  And they're kind of taking the torch [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=311.36s)]
*  Okay. Now it's our turn to try and discern together [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=314.18s)]
*  Who will be which one of us will be the best choice to lead the church to continue? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=319.02s)]
*  To kind of inspire the 1.3 billion Catholics throughout the world to live their faith [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=324.26s)]
*  So that sense of okay with the door closing a new phase of this process has begun [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=328.94s)]
*  I'm part of it and I imagine just asking the Holy Spirit for the grace so they can do a good job [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=334.41999999999996s)]
*  Do the best they can to listen to listen to each other to discern to be guided and just to be in that place [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=341.29999999999995s)]
*  They must be humbled, you know to kind of be such a you know, we've been the Catholic Church has been around for 2,000 years [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=348.54s)]
*  So these types of things have been happening and every generation, you know [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  It's just some more people more human beings just like us [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=358.98s)]
*  Who have who kind of take the torch and carry it forward? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=362.26s)]
*  Imagine there's a lot of different emotions going through their hearts and their minds right now [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=365.74s)]
*  Yeah, no one knows at this moment who that next person will be [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=369.58s)]
*  Claudio you interviewed the Pope's tailor and anticipation of whoever is [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=373.7s)]
*  Selected he's got vestments in multiple sizes ready to go right? Tell us about what you learned [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=379.38s)]
*  Well, it's such a small [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=387.02s)]
*  Tailor shop just steps away from the Vatican in Borgo Pio [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=388.62s)]
*  That's the small area just around here at the Vatican and he prepared three white cassocks one small medium and one large [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=392.58s)]
*  Because obviously we're not gonna know until the last minute who the Pope is going to be [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=400.3s)]
*  So they just want to make sure that the castle fits them and then yesterday the Vatican released some [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=404.74s)]
*  Some video from inside the Sistine Chapel where we saw those cassocks hanging on a clothes rack [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=411.06s)]
*  So it was very cute because there was no people would could just go in and see him working on these cassocks [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  There was no secrecy [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=423.48s)]
*  Certainly it's not as secret as the as the conclave itself [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=425.64000000000004s)]
*  So it was very fascinating to see the the behind the scenes of making of a cassock and also all these details [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=431.0s)]
*  He told me that in theory there should be 33 buttons on the cassock [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=436.68s)]
*  Obviously, you know the years of Christ even though he said at these days, you know [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=442.04s)]
*  It's maybe 28 29 because I don't know for fashion or garment needs [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=446.56s)]
*  And so there's all this little we can see them right there actually yeah [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  Anna they they are they're there [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=456.44000000000005s)]
*  Hanging on the in the room of tears. That's right. This is a sacristy behind the Sistine Chapel [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=459.52000000000004s)]
*  It's called the room of tears Deborah because Pope's weep [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=465.44000000000005s)]
*  Such an emotional moment that yes, it's gotten that reputation over the years [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=470.04s)]
*  So they solid a lacrimet. So yes exactly the room of tears that has this this is this is where exactly after a [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=473.40000000000003s)]
*  Cardinal receives the two-third of the votes and he's elected Pope then [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=480.91999999999996s)]
*  In this case the senior Cardinal Bishop Pietro Parolin will ask him [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=485.91999999999996s)]
*  Do you accept if the Pope if the Pope if the Cardinal accepts? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=490.79999999999995s)]
*  Then you know he becomes Pope and then he will be taken back to the sacristy actually first he's asked [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=495.96s)]
*  Which name he wants to be known as Pope as we know? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=503.08s)]
*  Cardinal Bergoglio wants to be known as Pope Francis that Cardinal Ratzinger wants to be known as Benedict 16 and so forth and then they've been [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=507.42s)]
*  Taken to that sacristy behind the Sistine Chapel where they will [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=514.62s)]
*  Where he will wear for the first time the white cassock then he will go back into the Sistine Chapel [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=518.5s)]
*  Receive the congratulations from the other from the other cardinals and then after an hour [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=523.5400000000001s)]
*  We will see him appear on the central loggia the central balcony of st. Peter's Square where the world will know [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=528.26s)]
*  Who was elected Pope and we see all these people there in st [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=535.22s)]
*  Peter's Square just waiting just waiting with the rest of the world who are watching these images [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=539.7s)]
*  Keeping an eye on that that chimney on the Sistine Chapel's [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=544.9000000000001s)]
*  Rooftop and we know the stoves are ready to burn the ballots in this first vote one vote coming today [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=550.98s)]
*  And so Kim if if they don't agree on a pope today [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=558.9000000000001s)]
*  And I don't think many people are expecting that to happen. What happens after that is their campaigning? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=563.5s)]
*  Do we know are they secluded what takes place? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=570.1400000000001s)]
*  Well, they go back to the Casa Santa Marta tonight. And again, I think this is a very prayerful time [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=573.6600000000001s)]
*  For everybody you've talked a lot about the solemnity of what they're experiencing right now [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=578.94s)]
*  They come back in the morning for mass. There will be two votes tomorrow in the morning [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=583.22s)]
*  And then two votes tomorrow if needed in the afternoon [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=587.4599999999999s)]
*  And so you can see smoke at various times during the day in the middle of the day and then again around this time again [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=590.38s)]
*  tomorrow night [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Wguv2_Zho&t=596.02s)]
