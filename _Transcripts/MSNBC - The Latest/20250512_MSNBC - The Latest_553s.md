# Trump's surgeon general pick is angering both the left and the right
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ)
*  You just announced your new nominee for the U.S. Surgeon General, who never finished her [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=0.0s)]
*  residency and is not a practicing physician. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=5.88s)]
*  So can you explain why you picked her to be America's top doctor? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=8.92s)]
*  Because Bobby thought she was fantastic. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=12.42s)]
*  She's highly, she's a brilliant woman. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=14.18s)]
*  Bobby really thought she was great. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=16.6s)]
*  I don't know her. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=18.16s)]
*  I listened to the recommendation of Bobby. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=19.16s)]
*  Donald Trump passing the buck again. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=21.84s)]
*  This time about his pick, or as he puts it, R.F.K. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=24.2s)]
*  for U.S. Surgeon General Casey Means. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=27.48s)]
*  Means is a doctor turned wellness influencer who is prominent in the make America healthy [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=30.4s)]
*  again sphere. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=35.36s)]
*  It has the Associated Press reports. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=36.36s)]
*  She quote, has no government experience and dropped out of her surgical residency program, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=38.32s)]
*  saying she became disillusioned with traditional medicine. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  In other words, she fits right into this Trump administration 2.0. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=47.36s)]
*  Molly John Fass and Cameron Caskey are still with us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=52.4s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  Cameron, what does her selection say to you? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=57.04s)]
*  Well I was reading up on it and I saw that she said she talked to trees, which made me [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=60.24s)]
*  say, oh my god, I miss Game of Thrones because they do that on that show. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=65.28s)]
*  It's very concerning. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=69.88s)]
*  I think that the make America healthy again movement is one of those examples of something [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=70.88s)]
*  that's so absurd we get distracted from how very dangerous it is. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  But there are outbreaks happening all over the country right now and we're already seeing [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=79.28s)]
*  the consequences of R.F.K. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=83.04s)]
*  Meyers madness. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=85.6s)]
*  There's certain things from the Trump administration and from all the things they're doing to pull [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=86.6s)]
*  apart the government where we are going to be seeing the effects for decades. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=90.91999999999999s)]
*  This is one of them and we're already seeing it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=95.28s)]
*  I think actually the most interesting piece of all of this is that the make America healthy [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  again movement is not actually unified behind her. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  There are a lot of people who think she's like not sufficiently anti-vax. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  We have this quote from some maha leader Mike Adams writing on X. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=112.2s)]
*  She's not a health freedom advocate. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  She's not a vaccine truther. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=120.68s)]
*  She'll never recommend natural cancer cures or remedies. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  She's basically cosplaying as a maha champion. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=126.68s)]
*  In reality she's an establishment pick and she'll push the establishment narrative 100% [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=130.0s)]
*  guaranteed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=135.72s)]
*  Count on it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=137.28s)]
*  So is she too crazy or not crazy enough Molly? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=138.28s)]
*  Don't threaten me with a good time. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=143.16s)]
*  The establishment pick. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=144.84s)]
*  She might get people to do medicine. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=146.74s)]
*  This is the fundamental problem with R.F.K. and with all of this is that it's undermining [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=149.28s)]
*  the Americans faith in vaccines right. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=154.04s)]
*  Things like measles mumps rubella right. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=157.0s)]
*  Kids used to die as babies because we did not have vaccines. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=160.0s)]
*  Now we have vaccines so less children die of preventable diseases except right now we [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=164.22s)]
*  have measles outbreaks in Texas and there's some in New Jersey and it's and you know lots [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=169.02s)]
*  of states actually yeah and it's sort of spreading and and they are and you see the polling that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=175.66s)]
*  people are less confident in vaccines and you know so much of the job that she's going [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=180.72s)]
*  to take on as surgeon general is about messaging to the American people like get your vaccines [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=186.06s)]
*  and go to the doctor and get a flu shot. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  These are like simple things but it's the fact that we don't know if she even believes [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=194.54s)]
*  in these sort of medical norms is how we're in trouble. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  But to some extent it is on brand for what this administration is about which is whether [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=204.06s)]
*  it is the deep state or the health officials they want you to have distrust in the government [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=209.62s)]
*  right there used to be a time when Americans would trust our institutions to be able to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  give us good health care advice or give us good science or give us good you know vaccine [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=220.86s)]
*  guidance but now we don't trust that just the same way we're supposed to believe that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=227.38000000000002s)]
*  Department of Justice is spying on us or that the deep state is running the CIA or running [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=232.58s)]
*  the Department of Defense. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=238.06s)]
*  It doesn't matter what the department is it's the same tactic. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=240.18s)]
*  I mean two of the people that we've talked about just in the past couple minutes have [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=243.46s)]
*  been a crypto guy and an influencer so you can't blame people for looking at this and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=247.34s)]
*  saying how am I supposed to have faith in our government because people like this are [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=252.78s)]
*  being allowed in our government. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=255.34s)]
*  R.F.K. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=256.5s)]
*  Jr. is one of the greatest examples of nepotism gone wrong that we've ever seen in this country [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=257.5s)]
*  and he's making decisions right now that are leading to things like a hepatitis A outbreak [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=263.54s)]
*  in Los Angeles and these are things we're going to be seeing the consequences of for [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=267.94s)]
*  So when people look at our institutions the institutions that we really need to trust [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=274.74s)]
*  and they see guys like this what are they supposed to say other than this American experiment [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=279.98s)]
*  we have is not working very well right now. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=284.62s)]
*  Well what do you think effective messaging against this looks like because the reality [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=286.54s)]
*  about the Maha movement is I have some family members who have been pulled into it are sort [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=291.7s)]
*  of Maha adjacent. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=296.58s)]
*  You know it begins with very understandable and legitimate concerns and fears about the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=298.34000000000003s)]
*  amount of money that pharmaceutical industries have made off of people their profits off [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=303.26s)]
*  of our suffering and so a lot of people there you know they actually have genuine concern [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=307.74s)]
*  and empathy for others and worries about our American medical system. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=313.46s)]
*  The challenge though is then that often what they're met with or the solution that they're [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=318.78s)]
*  offered are these influencers who are actually doing the same thing they're saying I will [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=322.18s)]
*  sell you a bottle of sketchy pills to fix that problem or here's some horse medicine [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=326.5s)]
*  you should take when you have covid but and so you know they're also making a profit off [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=331.42s)]
*  of your pain actually they just have found this like effective way to take advantage [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=335.90000000000003s)]
*  of the lack of trust and hurt. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=340.44s)]
*  So how do you message against that how do you get people back into the fold kind of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=342.38s)]
*  background into reality when the truth is the problem started with something that is [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=346.02000000000004s)]
*  very very real. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=349.78000000000003s)]
*  One of the first things I would say is talk to your doctor but people don't seem to respect [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=352.3s)]
*  qualifications anymore. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=355.98s)]
*  I mean you see people freak out about DEI hires whenever something goes wrong MAGA immediately [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=357.3s)]
*  finds a woman or minority involved and says hey look at this thing that DEI did so qualifications [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=363.34000000000003s)]
*  don't mean much to people and therefore I don't know what to say. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=370.54s)]
*  So what I would say is that we're coming from this post covid era right so one of the reasons [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=373.48s)]
*  why there's so much backlash against expertise and doctors and pharmaceutical companies and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=379.48s)]
*  all of this is because of covid right. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=386.82s)]
*  There was there was a feeling among some people that the wrong things were told you know it [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=388.61999999999995s)]
*  was a once in a lifetime hopefully pandemic and there were a lot of sort of on the fly [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=393.65999999999997s)]
*  you know you can get it when you're outside you can't get it when you're outside you need [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=399.61999999999995s)]
*  to be you know there just was a lot of people doing the best they could and that didn't [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=402.61999999999995s)]
*  mean you know still people died some people got long COVID all sorts of really bad stuff [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=406.94s)]
*  happened but they weren't in control of the outcomes and I think if you look back to the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=411.73999999999995s)]
*  1918 flu pandemic you can see a similar thing a sort of rebellion against medical professionals [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=415.82s)]
*  so I think we're riding through some of that. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=421.74s)]
*  The problem with Trump is that what he did was he elevated RFK jr. I think because he [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=424.06s)]
*  thought it would help him get elected and I think it did and you know he doesn't have [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=428.42s)]
*  he doesn't really care about the details which is what we see again and again with this administration. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=433.21999999999997s)]
*  I'm really worried not only about this institutional threat to you know trust in expertise trust [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=438.26s)]
*  in your doctor or other public health experts they're also purging a lot of data yeah yeah [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=445.52s)]
*  and so like the CDC has stopped collecting data on a number of important surveys related [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=452.56s)]
*  to mental health related to substance abuse related to diabetes people you know people [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=459.24s)]
*  in the lgbtq plus community we're just not collecting a lot of information that we had [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=466.44s)]
*  been and it will take a really long time to rebuild that infrastructure. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=472.48s)]
*  Do you think there's any way to get people to care about that I guess is my question [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=476.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't know how to get people to care about the fact that they are using people's private [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  information to make things like an autism registry yes Medicare and Medicaid information [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=484.52000000000004s)]
*  is being used to put these people on a list and crack down on autism which is there's [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7LJ9ff-OyQ&t=489.64000000000004s)]
