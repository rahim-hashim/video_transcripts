# Remembering Pope Francis' relationship with Trump and Biden
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM)
*  And President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will arrive in Rome in just a couple of hours to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=0.0s)]
*  attend the funeral. We now also know that President Biden and Dr. Joe Biden will be there. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  They are two presidents with very different relationships, personally and professionally [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=10.4s)]
*  with the late pope. For Trump, a pope who publicly challenged his policies from immigration to climate [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=14.64s)]
*  change. For Biden, a pope who didn't always agree with him, but with whom he had a real connection. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=20.96s)]
*  If tragedy is a defining characteristic of Joe Biden's life, the loss of his wife and daughter [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=27.52s)]
*  in a car crash in 1972, the untimely death of his son Bo of brain cancer in 2015. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=34.72s)]
*  Joe, Bo should be the one running for president, not me. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=42.0s)]
*  Then this was a seminal moment of healing. At a cancer conference five months after Bo's death, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=45.68s)]
*  Biden says Pope Francis asked to meet with him and his family. And I wish every [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=52.16s)]
*  grieving parent, brother, sister, mother, father, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=59.68s)]
*  would have had the benefit of his words, his prayers, his presence. He provided us with more [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=66.64s)]
*  comfort than even he, I think, will ever understand. To understand Biden, those closest to him say, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=74.32s)]
*  you must understand his lifelong connection to his Roman Catholic faith. But also what is perhaps [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=82.08s)]
*  his unlikely connection with Pope Francis? You are the most significant warrior for peace I've [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  ever met. These are men that came into office in a sense with similar mandates to clean up their own [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=93.44s)]
*  houses. And I think because that, in a sense, they found one another, they found ways to communicate [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=98.64s)]
*  despite their differences, where they had a sense of mutual respect. The world's two most [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=103.92s)]
*  prominent and powerful Catholics with much in common, both known for their empathy, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=109.52s)]
*  both finding their power later in life, Francis at 76, Biden at 78. So help me God. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=115.28s)]
*  And both also content without the perks of power, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=123.36s)]
*  Francis riding the bus as bishop, Biden with his affinity for Amtrak. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=126.64s)]
*  But it's abortion and the Dobbs decision that illuminates how their personal closeness [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=133.68s)]
*  seemed to defy their differences. Biden's position, of course, is consistent with his party, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=138.72s)]
*  but not his church. And here in Rome, the pope suggested that Biden should think more carefully [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=143.68s)]
*  about what it means to be a Catholic. Biden's often reminded of that split when he attends [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=148.88s)]
*  weekly mass with anti-abortion protesters outside his church in Delaware. And yet on Francis's 2015 [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=154.32s)]
*  visit to the U.S., Biden stayed close, greeting him at the airport alongside President Obama. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=162.24s)]
*  Front row for his address to Congress and there for the farewell in Philly, building a bridge with [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=168.48s)]
*  the Vatican that continued into Biden's presidency. The Vatican's made no secrets about the fact that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=174.16s)]
*  they consider their relationship with the Biden administration to be a much more friendlier and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=180.0s)]
*  open relationship than they had with the Trump administration. Biden had met with popes before, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  John Paul II at the Vatican in 1980 when he was a senator, Benedict in 2014, where Biden says he [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  told the pope to lighten up on American nuns accused of straying too far from their mission. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=196.32s)]
*  But with Francis, there was a deeper relationship that for the pope transcended their significant [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=201.76s)]
*  differences. He focuses on the fact that they are both passionately devoted to combating climate [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  change and their attention to the poor and helping migrants and immigrants. And he's not going to let [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  the other elements interfere with what common grounds they have together. In 2021, when Biden [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=219.68s)]
*  and Francis met again at the Vatican, the president gave the pope a century old handmade cloak, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=228.0s)]
*  the box that held it inscribed with this Bible verse. If any of you has a grievance against [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=233.68s)]
*  someone, forgive as the Lord forgave you. Joining us now, Eugene Robinson, Pulitzer Prize-winning [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=239.52s)]
*  journalist and an MSNBC political analyst. As I was reminded of the pope and what he meant to Joe [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=246.96s)]
*  Biden in terms of his son, Bo, who of course died of cancer. I was also thinking earlier this week, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=253.84s)]
*  I met with the parents of Hirsch Goldberg-Polin, who of course was the American Israeli who was [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=260.08s)]
*  killed. And they talked about meeting so many world leaders who offered sympathy, but they said [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=265.6s)]
*  Pope Francis showed empathy. What is the power of empathy in the modern world? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=271.44s)]
*  Empathy is a very, very powerful force, Chris. And it's something, it's the way that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=279.12s)]
*  that Pope Francis used his papacy and his entire life as a priest. Really, he was almost a parish [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=286.88s)]
*  priest in St. Peter's because he made the faithful feel and non-Catholics feel that he embraced them [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=299.92s)]
*  no matter what differences they might have, including doctrinal differences or differences [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  on various issues. He disagreed with President Biden, not just on abortion, but for example, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=321.92s)]
*  on gay marriage. Yet Francis made clear that there is room in the church for LGBTQ people [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=329.2s)]
*  and that gay unions could be blessed, not sanctified, but blessed within the church. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=340.96s)]
*  He was a pope with open arms. And I think President Biden not only respected that and responded [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=349.68s)]
*  to it, but I think he felt very deeply that this was a good man and a good pope. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=359.2s)]
*  You know, the fact that President Biden and the pope had differing views on any number of things, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=368.64s)]
*  as you say, and that it didn't impact their personal closeness, took a lot of notice within [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=373.52s)]
*  the church, within the religious community. And I think some people liked it more than others. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  But the fact that they could work together on the issues that they both care about, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=384.64s)]
*  is there also a message for today's political landscape? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=389.84s)]
*  I sure hope so. I hope so. And I think both of them hoped so, that by example, they show [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=394.64s)]
*  there is room for disagreement, yet cooperation. That those two things, disagreement and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=405.12s)]
*  cooperation, were not mutually exclusive. And that we could all agree on a certain humanity [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=415.6s)]
*  and a certain empathy. We could all agree that we want to end suffering, that we want to end [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=427.12s)]
*  hunger and poverty, that we want to end war. And then we could talk about how we do these things, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=437.36s)]
*  but we could agree on those basics. So when you get beyond the basics, and I think there is this [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=444.56s)]
*  intangible thing, right? I've had people ask me, why so much attention to a pope from one religion? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=452.64s)]
*  And obviously, he's the leader of nearly 1.4 billion Catholics. He's the most recognizable [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=458.8s)]
*  religious leader in the world. But not every pope has gotten the kind of attention that John Paul [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=465.2s)]
*  or Francis has gotten. What do you think it is that has, the appeal that has transcended people of [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=472.08s)]
*  faith? Well, first of all, the popes you mentioned, John Paul and Pope Francis, in their way, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=480.24s)]
*  they were both very strong personalities, very different personalities, but very strong [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  personalities in that they were sort of pure and complete representations of their belief system. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=495.68s)]
*  And they were both in their way, men of action. Pope Francis, of course, was the first pope from [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=506.08s)]
*  Latin America, the first pope from the Southern Hemisphere. So there was an affinity there with [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=518.88s)]
*  many people around the world that I think we don't fully appreciate. I think that was a very deep [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=525.68s)]
*  connection that many Catholics around the world felt with him because of those qualities, because [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=534.64s)]
*  of his beginnings. And then beyond that, because of the way he represented the poor and the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=542.3199999999999s)]
*  dispossessed and those sort of on the outside. And he called for more equality, a better sharing [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=554.0s)]
*  of the bounty of the earth and the bounty of the world economy that included those who, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=565.4399999999999s)]
*  at the moment, are left out. And I think that was just really important to many people, and not just [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=575.76s)]
*  Catholics around the world, but people really identified with this pope. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7Sa3h24aM&t=584.0s)]
