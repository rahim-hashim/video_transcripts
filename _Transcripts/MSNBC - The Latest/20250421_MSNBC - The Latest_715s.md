# 'He hit the ball squarely into his own goal': Analyst blames Trump for market plunge
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA)
*  We are keeping a close eye on the Vatican as the world mourns the loss of Pope Francis, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=0.0s)]
*  known as the People's Pope. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=5.08s)]
*  He passed away early this morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=6.8s)]
*  We'll have much more coverage on his incredible legacy and life and what comes next for the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=8.4s)]
*  world's 1.4 billion Catholics coming up shortly. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=13.32s)]
*  But we start with breaking news out of the White House and the brewing conflict sparked [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=17.1s)]
*  by Donald Trump. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=21.02s)]
*  It threatens to send shockwaves to the U.S. economy and the world's economies. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  The market's reacting to Donald Trump's ongoing onslaught of personal attacks and smears on [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=26.88s)]
*  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=32.86s)]
*  All three major stock indices experiencing major losses today. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=35.4s)]
*  The Dow Jones down more than 900 points. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=39.44s)]
*  The cause? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=41.84s)]
*  The dangerous one-man game of chicken that Donald Trump is playing with the job of the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=48.24s)]
*  Shortly after markets opened today, Donald Trump called on Powell to cut interest rates [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=51.28s)]
*  and called him a quote, major loser, end quote. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=55.24s)]
*  That smear came on the heels of Kevin Hassett, Donald Trump's director for the National Economic [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=59.36s)]
*  Council, telling reporters on Friday while markets were closed that the Trump administration [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=64.16s)]
*  is looking at possible ways to fire Jerome Powell. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=69.68s)]
*  Powell has said in public on camera that he cannot be fired by Donald Trump. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=73.76s)]
*  He has said that publicly. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=78.48s)]
*  But the ongoing attacks and this direct attack on the institution that undergirds the entire [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=80.4s)]
*  American and by extension world economies, the institution that investors here and around [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  the world look to and trust is leading to fears of a deepening economic crisis. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=92.38000000000001s)]
*  New York Times reports this quote, the U.S. dollar continued its slide against nearly [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  every other major currency. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  It fell about 1% against the euro on Monday to the lowest in more than three years. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=106.64s)]
*  The dollar also fell against the Japanese yen to its lowest level since September. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=112.32s)]
*  The trend is even more stark against some other currencies. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=117.44s)]
*  The dollar at its lowest. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=120.44s)]
*  It has been against the Swiss franc in more than a decade. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=122.16s)]
*  Here's how our friend and colleague Steve Leesman put it earlier today. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=125.88s)]
*  This is what you get. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=130.72s)]
*  I mean, somebody needs to turn to the camera and tell the president to stop. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=131.72s)]
*  He is messing with the foundation of this country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=136.28s)]
*  He's messing with the foundation of the economy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=139.28s)]
*  He's messing with America's place in the global financial system. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=141.76000000000002s)]
*  Where's Jamie Dimon and David Solomon and Brian Moynihan? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  Where are the leaders of our financial community calling on the president to stop this business [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=149.84s)]
*  about trying to fire the Fed chair and you see what you get here in the markets, right? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=155.8s)]
*  I think these people have to, they're the leaders of the financial community. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=161.4s)]
*  They have a ton at stake and I think they have to step up. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=165.28s)]
*  Right there, which you just saw is where we start today with Steve Leesman, CNBC Senior [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=170.8s)]
*  Economics reporter. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=174.56s)]
*  Over to you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=178.16s)]
*  I mean, where are those people? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=179.16s)]
*  And I've been asking this story from a political chair in which I sit, seeing the incoming [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=180.16s)]
*  instability, seeing the, I mean, chicken isn't the right analogy because Jerome Powell isn't [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=187.24s)]
*  playing chicken. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=192.72s)]
*  He's doing his job. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=193.72s)]
*  But Trump is playing chicken with something even bigger than the markets, with the global [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=195.32s)]
*  economy, with the country, with our place in the world. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=199.88s)]
*  Why aren't those folks speaking up? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=202.52s)]
*  Well, I think they fear the president. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=205.12s)]
*  I mean, you've seen the way he's gone after the legal firms. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=208.2s)]
*  He's gone after the universities. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=211.0s)]
*  They don't want him to go out. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=212.96s)]
*  Look, they have a lot at stake. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=214.36s)]
*  I don't judge them, but it just strikes me that at some point somebody with some authority [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=216.52s)]
*  has to step up and say, this is not the way to do things. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=222.64s)]
*  I mean, look, Nicole, this was another day in financial markets in Trump's America. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=225.88s)]
*  He turned around and he hit the ball squarely into his own goal and he scored another own [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  goal. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=237.6s)]
*  This did not have to happen today. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=238.6s)]
*  We ended up down 900 and some points on the Dow Jones. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=239.67999999999998s)]
*  We were off as much as 1200 and it really looks directly related to his comments and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=243.6s)]
*  that the president is going to potentially fire the Fed chair. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=249.52s)]
*  We don't know if that's going to happen. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=253.12s)]
*  Some people put a low probability on it, but let me see if I can connect this to the things [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  that you report on all day long, which is not necessarily financial markets, but what's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=258.68s)]
*  going on with the Supreme Court, what's going on with the legal firms, going on with Harvard [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=263.04s)]
*  and these other schools. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=266.32s)]
*  There are things that the president has done that nobody ever thought a president would [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=267.52s)]
*  do. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=272.48s)]
*  That's why in financial markets you cannot dismiss some probability that the president [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=274.48s)]
*  will fire the Fed chair. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=280.44s)]
*  People say, oh, it's not going to happen. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  I said, well, we thought he was going to follow the Supreme Court. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=283.56s)]
*  We thought he was not going to necessarily withhold X billions of dollars from Harvard. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=286.44s)]
*  So it's all of the same piece in that you cannot relax and you cannot bet on a team [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=290.66s)]
*  where the captain is hitting the ball into his own net. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=296.76s)]
*  Steve, let me try to connect the questions you asked to the questions I've asked for [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=300.48s)]
*  nine years. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=305.76s)]
*  I mean, why not Jamie Dimon? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=306.76s)]
*  And I will judge him in this context. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  I would never question his economic acumen, right? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=312.56s)]
*  Not my expertise. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  I come and I speak to you with all the humility I can muster. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=317.08000000000004s)]
*  But as an American, why not ask every corner of our country to want the best for the whole [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=321.68s)]
*  country? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=328.32s)]
*  If you destroy the economy, you destroy the first person Donald Trump promised to help, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=329.32s)]
*  the forgotten man and woman. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=334.84s)]
*  Why not judge Jamie Dimon for not doing more to stand up for the forgotten men and women [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=336.2s)]
*  who are the whole reason we're here? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=343.48s)]
*  Donald Trump so effectively communicated with them going back to 2015. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=345.28s)]
*  Why not ask Jamie Dimon to do more for them? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=349.08s)]
*  Well, I obviously think they ought to be stepping up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  They ought to be talking. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  I guess the point I was making is these are regulated institutions and this president, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=356.8s)]
*  if he wants, can bring the hammer down on them. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=360.6s)]
*  They have a responsibility to show it is I'm not going to defend them. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=363.68s)]
*  I think they do need to speak up. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think unless if this goes any further, look, the thing that connects all of the things [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  that were in the red today and you read them, the dollar bonds and stocks is people are [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=373.32s)]
*  selling U.S. assets. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=379.02s)]
*  They're selling America. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=380.82s)]
*  And we've talked about that before. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=382.32s)]
*  And at some point, they need to step up and help put some kind of floor under this market, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=384.2s)]
*  some kind of sense that there are people in this country with authority who will step [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=389.47999999999996s)]
*  up to protect essentially America's preeminent place in the globe when it comes to financial [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=394.28s)]
*  markets. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=400.08s)]
*  You know, I, Andrew Sorkin's out here and I, like a dog with a bone, I could not let [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=401.08s)]
*  it go that what you're saying, what he was saying was true, that they're afraid, not [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=407.52s)]
*  necessarily just for themselves, but for the institutions they lead, the businesses they [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  lead and the shareholders to whom they are responsible. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=418.12s)]
*  But I guess I want to ask you if that's changing, if they see Harvard taking a different approach [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=422.48s)]
*  and standing and fighting, if they see the four law firms that decided to fight Donald [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=428.36s)]
*  Trump's retribution and they see the court siding with them, are those stories being [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=433.12s)]
*  tracked closely? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=439.3s)]
*  Are they being watched by the leaders of companies and the general counsels of companies? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=440.52s)]
*  I mean, are they considering a more confrontational posture? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  Not that I know of. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=450.44s)]
*  I mean, I know I've talked to some of them on background and their initial, before all [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=451.44s)]
*  this stuff with the Fed chair started, was to try to lay low, ride it out and see if [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=455.24s)]
*  they could essentially get by unscathed. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=460.84s)]
*  But I think you're making an interesting point, Nicole, that they're fast approaching a place [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=463.71999999999997s)]
*  where they're not going to be able to get by unscathed, where their share prices and [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=467.78s)]
*  all the things that they actually care about and the work that they do is not going to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=472.21999999999997s)]
*  be, they cannot be immune from this. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=476.06s)]
*  And at some point they're going to have to step forward. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=478.38s)]
*  I will point out, Nicole, that Congress has not shown much more spine than these bankers [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=480.97999999999996s)]
*  out there. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=487.53999999999996s)]
*  So in terms of where I know some Democrats have spoken up, but in terms of the actual [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=488.53999999999996s)]
*  actions taken by Congress, they have not done anything. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=492.62s)]
*  I know that there's been some attempt to do some behind the scenes work. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=496.06s)]
*  I know that Scott Besson, you read that story in the Wall Street Journal where they had [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=499.70000000000005s)]
*  to wait for Peter Navarro to leave the room in order for Besson and Lutnick to go in and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=503.94s)]
*  get the president to null his or to change his mind about his reciprocal tariffs. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=509.22s)]
*  Well, if that's what's going on in the White House, it's kind of interesting to think about [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=515.7s)]
*  whether the bankers could even have some effect. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=519.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, look, that is the quintessential Trump story. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=521.46s)]
*  I mean, the first time he left the country, advisors had to wait for other advisors to [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=525.5799999999999s)]
*  leave the room to sneak in America's affirmation to Article 5 and our NATO obligations into [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=530.42s)]
*  a speech. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=536.3s)]
*  I mean, the Trump story is always some version of this, right? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=537.3s)]
*  Besson has to wait and it's like third grade, right? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=540.8199999999999s)]
*  You have to wait until the bully goes to the bathroom to get all the kids to stand on the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=543.3399999999999s)]
*  side of the kid being bullied. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=547.3399999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's the quintessential Trump story. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=548.3399999999999s)]
*  And I guess I always come back to this curiosity about whether they're changing the way they [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=551.14s)]
*  look at Trump, whether it's no longer a set of policies, but a real desire to understand [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=557.26s)]
*  the psychology of Donald Trump and the people around him. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=561.8199999999999s)]
*  Have they shifted the lens with which they're looking at Trump? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=564.62s)]
*  Are they still trying to gird? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=569.02s)]
*  I think they're trying to keep on his good side because, as you remember, Nicole, they [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=572.62s)]
*  are trying to get the Federal Reserve and other bank regulators to loosen some of the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=577.34s)]
*  regulations that came out of the great financial crisis. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=582.94s)]
*  And so they're hoping for that to come through. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=586.38s)]
*  And I think that is something that is keeping them at bay, the hope that that will happen [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=588.4200000000001s)]
*  and whether or not they speak up. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=593.3000000000001s)]
*  I think they think there's some danger that they could put that reform that they're hoping [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=595.5s)]
*  for in danger if they come out and try to get the president to ease the rhetoric about [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=599.4200000000001s)]
*  the Fed chair. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=604.7800000000001s)]
*  Look, I don't think it's an issue that the president... [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=606.22s)]
*  Well, it is, but we've kind of normalized this idea that the president is going to have [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=608.22s)]
*  his say on monetary policy. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=612.5799999999999s)]
*  But the idea of him calling him a loser and toying with this idea of replacing him, that's [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=616.26s)]
*  what ends up creating or making a third world financial system or third world country out [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=621.6999999999999s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=627.3s)]
*  Is there a scenario where they think this passes? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=629.54s)]
*  Is there still wish casting or do they take Donald Trump seriously? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=634.38s)]
*  I mean, that's for you to figure out. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=639.38s)]
*  I think they would listen to you on that. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=642.14s)]
*  It's the old seriously versus literally. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=643.7800000000001s)]
*  Nobody listens to me. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=645.7800000000001s)]
*  Nobody in my house. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=646.7800000000001s)]
*  Nobody listens. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=647.7800000000001s)]
*  I mean, I guess what I'm really trying to ask is are they hoping for the best still? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=648.7800000000001s)]
*  Do they think he'll move on from Jerome Powell? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=654.0600000000001s)]
*  I think they are hoping for the best. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=657.0600000000001s)]
*  I think they're kind of dismissing it. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=658.82s)]
*  Look, I'm getting messages from people, it's going to happen, it's going to happen, he's [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=662.22s)]
*  going to replace him. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=665.8199999999999s)]
*  And I'm getting messages from people that say, nah, he would never do it. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=666.8199999999999s)]
*  So I mean, it's the old... [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=670.38s)]
*  You know, like I said, Nicole, they promised me there'd be no politics on this. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=672.4599999999999s)]
*  It's the seriously versus literally idea. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=675.6999999999999s)]
*  I think that when we look at how these markets are trading, we see them trading with some [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=679.02s)]
*  probability. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=683.54s)]
*  That's what I think what today's sell off was about, that there could be a replacement [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=684.54s)]
*  of the Fed chair and that would, as we've discussed, deeply undermine trust and faith [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=688.1s)]
*  in the U.S. capital system. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHMqIbFzaA&t=693.1800000000001s)]
