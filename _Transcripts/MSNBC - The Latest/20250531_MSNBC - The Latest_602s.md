# ‘The musk will linger in the air’: Rep. Crockett on Elon Musk’s departure leading DOGE
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ)
*  Joining us now is the congresswoman from Texas Jasmine Crockett who serves on the house doge subcommittee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=0.0s)]
*  congresswoman welcome to the weekend, so just your thoughts on Elon Musk and his departure from Washington [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=7.76s)]
*  Hallelujah [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=19.06s)]
*  What I gotta say is it Sunday let us all give thanks to the good Lord above listen [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  Let me tell you something he is gone, but the musk is still going to linger in the air [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=26.3s)]
*  We know as you went through in your intro that there are so many people that have been impacted by [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=31.740000000000002s)]
*  These ridiculous and not thought-out cuts, and it's not just the federal workers [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=38.34s)]
*  It's those constituents of ours our citizens that are being impacted the hardest by these cuts [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  and so here it is you basically let this guy run wild and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=50.88s)]
*  Honestly, I feel like all of the cuts to federal employees [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=55.74s)]
*  That was nothing more than a distraction for the things that he really wanted to do which is to make sure that there was no [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=59.9s)]
*  oversight over [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=66.1s)]
*  His companies the companies that were under investigation [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=67.86s)]
*  this was to kind of keep us busy and distracted and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=71.22s)]
*  Unfortunately in the process we have harmed our federal government and ultimately we are harming our overall economy [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=74.94s)]
*  Congressman like you said the damage has already been done the people been fired the change a lot of those changes have been made is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=82.72s)]
*  There any reason for folks to anticipate that at some point? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=89.72s)]
*  The you guys will the Congress or someone will be able to claw back some of these jobs and policies that people really need around [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=93.96s)]
*  the country I [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  Mean would you really want to work for the federal government at this moment? I mean like like let's be honest [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=103.24s)]
*  You know in in reality we have been down as it relates to some of our federal workforce anyway [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=108.83999999999999s)]
*  This is one reason that the Biden-Harris administration [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=115.3s)]
*  invested so much money in the inflation reduction act when it came to the IRS because they wanted to make sure that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  Those people they were best trained to do those complicated [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=124.52s)]
*  audits of people's taxes basically the very very rich [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=128.64s)]
*  Making sure that we have the best of the best to make sure that we could bring in additional income [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=132.32s)]
*  In addition to that while we've been talking about the reconciliation package [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=136.56s)]
*  And we've been talking about the cuts and how many people are going to potentially lose their health care or how many people are gonna lose? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=140.4s)]
*  Food off of their tables one of the things that we've not been able to do because there's again still so much in this terrible [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=146.8s)]
*  Bill is talk about things that happened in the Oversight Committee such as deciding that they don't want [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  federal government employees to have the protections the protections that the federal court [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  Has acknowledged and said hey, you've got to reinstate these federal employees instead [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=164.32s)]
*  They want to change federal employees to at will so a lot of the things that once attracted people [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=168.86s)]
*  To want to come and work for the federal government. They are disappearing as well as well as making them pay more into [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=174.12s)]
*  Their first so it's it's absolutely insane and nobody wants to come work for us right now [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=181.96s)]
*  Congresswoman yesterday in the Oval Office it didn't exactly sound like Trump and Elon Musk were completely [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=187.52s)]
*  Breaking up he sounded like he might still be lingering in some unofficial capacity [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=193.78s)]
*  Yet, you know he had to end his special. He was at the final day as a special employee [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=199.84s)]
*  How is the House Oversight Committee going to keep holding Doge and the Elon Musk accountable? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  You said keep we never started [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=213.72s)]
*  Doge was just a little pet [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=217.56s)]
*  project for [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=220.52s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene to be able to say hey, they gave me something [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  I've got a gavel and so, you know the last Doge hearing that we had it was on [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=225.76s)]
*  trans folk [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=232.64s)]
*  Doing fencing. I mean we were talking to people that don't get any federal dollars whatsoever [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=234.16s)]
*  And dealing with that we have a Doge subcommittee hearing coming up and it's to talk about NGOs and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=239.48s)]
*  Basically to go after them [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  We have had a hearing on PBS and talk about why it's important to quote-unquote defund PBS [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=247.32s)]
*  I mean, we've not dealt with those things. We have tried to subpoena Elon Musk before the Republicans did not want to do that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=253.9s)]
*  I don't know why you wouldn't want to have your main man come in and tell us about all the great work that he's doing [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=260.16s)]
*  Unless he absolutely isn't doing any great work. So listen, I think that unfortunately [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=266.04s)]
*  We're gonna have to wait until the Democrats are in the majority [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=271.48s)]
*  Which will hopefully be in the midterms and then we can absolutely [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=274.36s)]
*  Bring Elon Musk in and we can have him under oath and we can have him [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=278.36s)]
*  Tell us about everything that he did because as I've been home this week [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=282.68s)]
*  To hear from my seniors that are concerned and don't have answers about how much information [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=286.96s)]
*  He had access to and what he did with that sensitive information. They are scared [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=292.2s)]
*  I'm congressman have a listen to what Elon Musk had to say in an interview on Tuesday about [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=298.08s)]
*  His thoughts on the so-called big beautiful bill that was passed by the house. I [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=306.28s)]
*  Was like disappointed to see the massive spending bill frankly [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=313.28s)]
*  Which increases the budget deficit not this decrease it and I reminds the work that the Doge team is doing [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=319.84s)]
*  I think a boat can be can be can be big or it could be beautiful [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=325.64000000000004s)]
*  Congresswoman I have no question just hold forth [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=333.72s)]
*  Listen I mean, you know, yeah, I'm not necessarily besties with Elon [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=341.68s)]
*  But when I can agree I'm just gonna agree because it's just the truth [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=347.24s)]
*  The reality is that we saw when this bill passed the house which it barely made it over the finish line [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=350.58s)]
*  215 to 214 we know that there were two Republicans that somehow went in my a we know that two Republicans voted with us [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=356.65999999999997s)]
*  And then we know that one Republican just voted president and let me just tell you [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=363.26s)]
*  Even if a Republican voted with us, it wasn't for the same reasons [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=367.97999999999996s)]
*  Okay, but we got to the same result, which is that this is a big bad bill [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=371.53999999999996s)]
*  Okay, and their reasons for saying you know what we're not gonna vote for this is because they still want to raise the debt ceiling [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  by five trillion dollars and so what I have explained to people is that the cuts that they want to give to the rich folk in [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=382.0s)]
*  This country are so deep that even after cutting almost 14 million people off their health care and cutting over [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=388.78s)]
*  $300 billion out of snap benefits as well as all the other ugly stuff [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=396.28s)]
*  And we don't talk about the fact that they want to have this big chunk of money so that ice agents can get approximately [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=401.3s)]
*  $42,000 a piece in a bonus [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=409.02s)]
*  So we had money that was going up for crazy stuff [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=411.42s)]
*  And then we also of course had to set aside enough money so that somebody could go golfing [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=414.18s)]
*  I believe that the number may be a billion dollars or so [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=419.14s)]
*  Over the four years for him to be able to go golfing [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=422.46s)]
*  This doesn't really make sense and frankly nobody has asked for these things to be their priorities [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=425.64s)]
*  But there are fiscal responsible [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=430.58000000000004s)]
*  Republicans that are saying listen [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=434.02000000000004s)]
*  I don't think they really care about the cuts [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=435.54s)]
*  But they absolutely care about the fact that we still are needing to lift the debt ceiling and honestly have nothing to show for it [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=437.58000000000004s)]
*  One might say that you would call this a bad-built bad-built butch bill [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=444.06s)]
*  You made a point about the senior [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=451.62s)]
*  Constituents speaking to you worried about their data [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=454.54s)]
*  Well one spending expenditure that doge signed off on is for the national security vendor Palantir to compile [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=457.06s)]
*  sweeping amounts of Americans personal data [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=465.66s)]
*  What is with that and what can I mean? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=469.66s)]
*  Privacy experts should be alarmed any American who cares about privacy should be alarmed [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=473.14000000000004s)]
*  What is going to happen with this you know this huge new? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=479.1s)]
*  vendor outlay [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=483.46s)]
*  Yeah, I have no idea but as my you know senior constituents were asking me [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=486.62s)]
*  What can they do because they are afraid you know what I am suggesting to any? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=492.78s)]
*  American senior or otherwise that is concerned to go ahead and make sure you are submitting your stories to your congressional member [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=497.65999999999997s)]
*  I you know am a lawyer right so as I was telling my seniors [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=504.94s)]
*  I need to be able to build my case and so I want to hear your stories so that ultimately [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=509.14s)]
*  When we are in the majority and when we do decide that we are going to have various hearings [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=514.42s)]
*  I can make it clear that this isn't about partisanship and frankly this isn't about me [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=519.5s)]
*  Just trying to do something just to say that I did it [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=524.14s)]
*  I am doing exactly what it is that my constituents have told me is a priority as I am their voice [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=526.5s)]
*  And so I need to make sure that the things that are top of mind for them that I make those things [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=532.78s)]
*  Heard and fleshed out on the federal level and frankly right now. You know we talked a lot about Elon [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=538.9s)]
*  We talked a lot about Donald Trump, but we are not putting enough blame on congressional Republicans and their complicity [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=545.1s)]
*  Listen these guys didn't go in and rob us blind by themselves [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=551.8199999999999s)]
*  They had a lot of people that conspired with them and our accomplices to them [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=556.26s)]
*  So when you are going out and voting just think about the fact that when we say that we are struggling and in a constitutional [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=562.6s)]
*  Crisis because these three co-equal branches of government seem to not necessarily be holding up [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=569.64s)]
*  It's because the people that are supposed to hold up their oaths have decided to abdicate their duties [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=575.44s)]
*  You [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1tnSQBzSCQ&t=592.48s)]
