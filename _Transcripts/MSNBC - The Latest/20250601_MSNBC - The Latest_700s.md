# Conservative lawyer: Attacks on judges are about ‘Trump getting what he wants’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM)
*  We begin with the escalating attacks by President Donald Trump and other White House officials [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=0.0s)]
*  against federal judges in response to the growing number of unfavorable court rulings [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=5.68s)]
*  that continue to pile up against this administration. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=10.96s)]
*  You can't have a judge in Boston running foreign policy in places all over the country [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=15.22s)]
*  because he's got a liberal bent or he's a radical left person. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=21.62s)]
*  We see this as this broader problem of rogue judges erecting essentially a judicial blockade. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=26.34s)]
*  Three judges of the U.S. Court of International Trade disagreed and brazenly abused their [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=34.94s)]
*  judicial power to usurp the authority of President Trump. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=39.78s)]
*  There is a troubling and dangerous trend of unelected judges inserting themselves into [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=42.78s)]
*  the presidential decision-making process. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=46.7s)]
*  When you have 700 judges, 10, 15, 20, 25 communist judges can try to run the entire country, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=48.78s)]
*  grind the gears of government to a halt, try to undermine and overthrow the previous election [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=56.06s)]
*  result. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=60.84s)]
*  It's been rightly called the judicial coup. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=61.84s)]
*  Throwing around terms like judicial coup, rogue judges, activist judges, communist judges, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=64.9s)]
*  the efforts by the White House appear focused on trying to undermine public confidence in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=71.42s)]
*  the judiciary. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=76.42s)]
*  Former Trump White House attorney Ty Cobb tells the New York Times, quote, Trump's attacks [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=78.02000000000001s)]
*  on the judges is an attempt to undo the separation of powers. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=82.44000000000001s)]
*  It's an attempt to take what is three co-equal branches and make it one dominant branch. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=86.28s)]
*  On Friday, we saw the latest example of a judge challenging Trump policies with a federal [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=93.06s)]
*  judge in California blocking the administration from revoking the temporary protected status [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=97.82000000000001s)]
*  of roughly 5,000 Venezuelans, which was a Biden-era extension of the program that Homeland [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=103.14s)]
*  Security Secretary Kristi Noem terminated. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=109.22s)]
*  Remember, with Congress under Republican control, it has been left to the judicial branch to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=112.58s)]
*  exercise the constitutional role of checks and balances on the man who would simply prefer [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=119.42s)]
*  to be a king. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=125.0s)]
*  Joining us now, conservative attorney George Conway. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=126.42s)]
*  He is president of the Society for the Rule of Law and Kimberly Atkins-Storz, senior opinion [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=129.56s)]
*  writer and columnist at the Boston Globe. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=134.88s)]
*  Thank you both very much for coming back to the weekend. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=139.04s)]
*  George? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  What do you, communist judges, radical left judges, these attacks on judges in the federal [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=144.68s)]
*  judiciary, what do you make of those attacks in addition to the president's attacks on [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=151.4s)]
*  the Federalist Society? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=156.72s)]
*  Because I thought they were like this, at least in Trump 1. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=158.0s)]
*  Well, they were. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=161.56s)]
*  And I say that I was a member of the Federalist Society for a long time. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=163.28s)]
*  In fact, I was a member of the Board of Visitors, National Board of Visitors. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=166.36s)]
*  Are you still? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=169.8s)]
*  No, not anymore. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=170.8s)]
*  Okay, just checking. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=171.8s)]
*  For at least 10 years. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=172.8s)]
*  So look, I mean, this is lying hypocrisy on the part of the administration, which is nothing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=174.84s)]
*  new. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=181.0s)]
*  If, for example, let's take the trade decision, the tariff decision. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=182.0s)]
*  Let's say President Kamala Harris were a nut job and she enacted a bunch of tariffs to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=186.72s)]
*  please organize labor, let's say. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=193.28s)]
*  And that had happened. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=196.32s)]
*  We would have had like 15 conservatives lawsuits brought everywhere in the country and it would [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=197.89999999999998s)]
*  have been in the same court. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=203.88s)]
*  And that court would have ruled exactly the same way and the Republicans would be fine. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  Yay, yay, yay, yay. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=211.72s)]
*  This is not about the law. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=213.0s)]
*  It's not about communist judges. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=215.84s)]
*  It's about Donald Trump getting what he wants. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=219.04s)]
*  And Ty Cobb was absolutely right there. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is the Trump too has been an attack on Congress. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=224.68s)]
*  He's pointing at the Capitol Dome as you can see out the window. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=231.88s)]
*  Because they're ignoring all these statutes that the courts are saying, wait a minute, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=235.12s)]
*  you can't ignore all these statutes. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=238.04s)]
*  And when the courts are saying, wait a minute, you can't make stuff up. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=239.72s)]
*  You can't ignore statutes. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=242.88s)]
*  You can't write statutes via executive order. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=244.08s)]
*  They're saying the courts are communist and launching a judicial coup. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=247.36s)]
*  So it's hip hop. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  But it's not just hip hop. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  It also is like a tactic and a strategy. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=258.0s)]
*  This is something there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  There's a reason why they're using language like a coup, activist judges. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  They're trying to, as Jonathan said in the intro, undermine the public's trust in our [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=266.6s)]
*  process. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=272.6s)]
*  So what's the reason that they want to do that? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=274.12s)]
*  Well, because it makes it easier for them to try to denigrate it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=275.40000000000003s)]
*  We all learned in elementary school, there are three branches of judges. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=280.16s)]
*  The legislative branch makes the laws, the executive enforces them, and the court says [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=283.92s)]
*  what the law is and what is constitutional. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=288.32000000000005s)]
*  And those, both the Congress and the courts are barriers to Donald Trump to what he wants [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  to do. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=296.56s)]
*  And he wants to plow through everything. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=297.56s)]
*  But what is really terrifying, well, there's a lot of things terrifying it, but one is [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=300.4s)]
*  these attacks on judges are putting actual people at risk. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=304.8s)]
*  It's putting judges and their families at risk. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=307.52s)]
*  We've seen in the past. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=309.16s)]
*  They're having to ramp up security. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=310.16s)]
*  They have to ramp up security. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=311.16s)]
*  We've seen in the past where people have shown up to the home of judges and committed violence. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=312.84s)]
*  So this is very, very dangerous at a very incendiary time. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=317.84s)]
*  It seems that the president has absolutely no regard about that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=321.94s)]
*  None. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=325.28s)]
*  So pardons have become big business now in D.C. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=326.28s)]
*  Literally. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=330.20000000000005s)]
*  We had yesterday, Liz Oyer was on our show and she was talking about how it's over $1 [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  billion that will not be paid to victims because of the people he's already pardoned. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  So that's restitution. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=342.8s)]
*  And then you have the lobbyists who are now working the pardon scene here in D.C. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=344.44s)]
*  And can you talk about what is going on with just this cottage industry now? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=349.92s)]
*  Look, I mean, when you have a administration that has completely abandoned any process, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=355.84s)]
*  normally the process is you go to the pardon office, the pardon office at the DOJ makes [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=362.59999999999997s)]
*  a neutral and objective assessment based upon law enforcement priorities and principles [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=368.08s)]
*  of justice. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=373.96s)]
*  And when you go past that, and other presidents have done it before, but not to the same extent. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=374.96s)]
*  And not as early. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=380.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=381.08s)]
*  They're doing it early. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=382.08s)]
*  They're doing it early. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=383.76s)]
*  And then you have all these grifting gatekeepers who want a profit off of it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=384.76s)]
*  This government has become, the government's an industry generally, people consider it [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=392.84s)]
*  because it's big, but this is an industry now that's become for profit for this particular [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=398.56s)]
*  administration and the people who surround it and suck up to it and live off of it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=405.12s)]
*  Why are they so empowered to be so brazen and just flout the law? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=411.56s)]
*  Because it's... [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=415.08s)]
*  I'm not listening to that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=416.08s)]
*  Who's going to prosecute you? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=417.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=418.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=419.08s)]
*  The DOJ is not going to do that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=420.08s)]
*  And the Republicans on the Hill aren't going to do it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=421.08s)]
*  It's not just the President of the United States who has criminal immunity for official [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=422.76s)]
*  acts. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=427.36s)]
*  What this administration is telling everybody is everyone who is our friend has criminal [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=429.15999999999997s)]
*  immunity for everything. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=434.6s)]
*  And deep pockets too. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  Because what a lot of these lobbyists that are working on, they're not doing it out of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=439.23999999999995s)]
*  goodwill. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=441.64s)]
*  They're being paid top dollar in order to get these pardon requests in front of Donald [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=442.64s)]
*  Trump. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=448.28s)]
*  And that is really detrimental if you want to remember what the clemency power is supposed [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=449.28s)]

*  It is a tool of justice. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=455.32s)]
*  It's for people who have paid their time and have been repentant. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=456.32s)]
*  It's for people who may have faced some sort of injustice. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=460.08s)]
*  It's to right wrongs that may have been done. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=463.08s)]
*  It's not meant to be a get out of jail free. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=465.68s)]
*  This is the most messed up monopoly game ever. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=468.48s)]
*  Someone gets elected and then his friends get out of jail free cards while everybody [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=473.68s)]
*  else pays more taxes. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=478.44s)]
*  And instead of remorse, you have the guy in the car with his wife saying, we screwed the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=479.44s)]
*  feds or something. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=483.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=484.4s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=485.4s)]
*  On this messed up monopoly game, there's a new thing here which we should talk more about. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=486.4s)]
*  You just brought it up. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=491.16s)]
*  The criminal immunity that the Supreme Court gave the president, that is a huge factor [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=492.4s)]
*  here that I don't think we talk enough about. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=498.96s)]
*  Why is he so brazen? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=502.12s)]
*  Because the Supreme Court's like, do what you want to do. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=504.0s)]
*  Just call it official acts. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=507.0s)]
*  I got a yes and no on that one. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=508.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=510.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=511.12s)]
*  If the president... [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=512.12s)]
*  That was a yes first. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=513.12s)]
*  Look, I mean, the immunity extends to acts within the official... [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=514.12s)]
*  Outer perimeter of official duties. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=522.8s)]
*  Doesn't extend to taking bribes. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  And the Supreme Court said taking bribes or gratuities, bribes, crypto schemes, none of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=526.1999999999999s)]
*  that is covered. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=534.88s)]
*  The only reason why he has immunity for that is because he's sitting as sitting president, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=537.4s)]
*  can't be prosecuted, and he can tell the Justice Department what its priorities are. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=542.4399999999999s)]
*  One thing on the Supreme Court, as we're talking about in WAPO, a headmind recently, Supreme [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=546.56s)]
*  Court walks a tightrope as it confronts Trump's power moves. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=551.24s)]
*  Roberts wants to avoid conflict with the other branches until he absolutely has to come into [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=554.6400000000001s)]
*  conflict with them, said John Yoo, who is a law professor at the University of California [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=559.08s)]
*  at Berkeley. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=563.2s)]
*  And he also said, the court doesn't have the sword or the purse. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=564.2s)]
*  Its power is persuasion, and the justices understand that more than most people and [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=568.5200000000001s)]
*  are sensitive to it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=573.0s)]
*  Now... [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=575.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=576.2s)]
*  Yes, sure. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=577.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=578.2s)]
*  There's a way to operate behind the scenes. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=580.2s)]
*  But at the same time, if you don't make it clear to the other branches of government [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=583.48s)]
*  that you are doing your job, you know what I mean? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=587.36s)]
*  You don't want a direct confrontation. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=590.76s)]
*  That was also in the article. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=592.2s)]
*  You don't want a direct confrontation with the executive branch. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=593.2s)]
*  Your job is to do that all the time. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=596.12s)]
*  You are always in direct conflict with the other branches of government. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=598.0400000000001s)]
*  Yes, you always rub up. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=601.32s)]
*  That's the part of the job. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=602.4000000000001s)]
*  And I will add first on the immunity, what you said is exactly right, George. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=604.96s)]
*  That is not how Donald Trump treats immunity. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=609.04s)]
*  He believes that he has the Supreme Court in his... [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=610.9599999999999s)]
*  Or supposed to. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=616.16s)]
*  Supposed to have the Supreme Court in his corner and that they're going to bless everything [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=617.16s)]
*  that he does. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=621.68s)]
*  That was the reason for that wonderful thank you that he gave with a handshake at the State [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=622.68s)]
*  of the Union to Chief Justice John Roberts. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=626.5999999999999s)]
*  But the problem is Chief Justice John Roberts, who is the institutionalist who cares about [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=629.16s)]
*  the reputation of the court, does, and John, you was exactly right, does walk really, really [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=634.84s)]
*  carefully when it comes up to it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=639.1600000000001s)]
*  It's actually other justices like Kataji Brown Jackson who stood up and said, look, judges [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=640.6800000000001s)]
*  are being attacked and this is wrong and this needs to stop. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=645.32s)]
*  John Roberts issued a written short statement some months ago and thought that that was [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=649.0400000000001s)]
*  doing the... [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=654.32s)]
*  He gave him a lot of flowers for that one, yeah. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=655.32s)]
*  Yeah, I was not one of those people. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=656.84s)]
*  He is the head of the federal judiciary. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=658.44s)]
*  He has the bully pulpit. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=661.6s)]
*  Yes, he has one vote on the court. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=663.36s)]
*  He's no more powerful than the other justices. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=665.2s)]
*  But in that position, he does have a lot of power to step up and say, hey, not only do [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=667.2s)]
*  you not attack judges, when they issue you an order, you follow it. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=672.0s)]
*  And he can do that and he has yet to do that and that's a problem. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mV9RzKdsrM&t=676.44s)]
