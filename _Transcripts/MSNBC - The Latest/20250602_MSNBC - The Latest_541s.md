# 'I imagine she has consultants, maybe they’re on vacation’: Nicolle Wallace on Joni Ernst's apology
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo)
*  They will be coming off. So we people are not well, we all are going to die. So for heaven's sakes, for heaven's sakes, folks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=0.0s)]
*  We all are going to die. Peek-banga, right? We showed you that moment on Friday. That was Republican Senator Joni Ernst in Iowa telling her constituents, quote, well, we're all going to die. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=16.0s)]
*  She said it in her defense of her own support for Donald Trump's big, beautiful bill and the consequences, which her constituents claim will make people die. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=32.0s)]
*  The clip went viral. Joni Ernst was roundly mocked over her callousness, over her support of a bill that is going to do real damage to real people's lives, her constituents. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=43.0s)]
*  She's supposed to at least pretend publicly to care. So on Saturday, she issued this apology. We're going to show it to you in full. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=53.0s)]
*  She's up for reelection next November. We want to show you how seriously she took the reaction to her comments. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=61.0s)]
*  Hello, everyone. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for a statement that I made yesterday at my town hall. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=68.0s)]
*  See, I was in the process of answering a question that had been asked by an audience member when a woman who was extremely distraught screamed out from the back corner of the auditorium, people are going to die. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=79.0s)]
*  And I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this earth. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=95.0s)]
*  So I apologize. And I'm really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=110.0s)]
*  But for those that would like to see eternal and everlasting life, I encourage you to embrace my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=122.0s)]
*  I don't know what's going on with her. I imagine she has consultants. Maybe they were on vacation. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=137.0s)]
*  Yeah, wow. Joining our coverage, Mitch Landrieu. He served as mayor of New Orleans and a senior adviser to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Sarah's with us as well. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=144.0s)]
*  So, Mitch, I'm old enough to remember when the Republicans trumped up propaganda about death panels almost or certainly created a lot of legislative friction for President Obama's health care policies. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=153.0s)]
*  I won't ask you where the outrage is, because I think conservatives write in their own brief, as we were discussing in the last block, about how conservatives in Congress have left the arena. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=172.0s)]
*  But what do you make of just how out of it the Republicans are when they use their time and their platform and their on-air moments to defend saying to a constituent scared about Medicaid cuts, quote, we're all going to die, and then go on to mock them in that video? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=182.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's great to see you and it's great to see my friend Sarah, who I love. That comment, you know, I've done a lot of community meetings in my time in office, and sometimes you'll say something that you don't mean, and the next day you go, you know what, I was a little out of the way. I didn't really mean that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=200.0s)]
*  So I was actually more shocked by her not so much Mother Teresa explanation the next day. Sometimes people let you into a window of their soul that tells you who they really are. They don't really require much explanation. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=214.0s)]
*  This bill, it's really presents a clear choice. The Republicans think that for some reason there's an incredible need to give the wealthiest people in America a tax break and to do that, that you have to take away life saving health care from the American people. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=229.0s)]
*  Make no mistake about it. People will die because of this. If you live in a rural area and your rural hospital closes down and your daddy or your mama have a heart attack and they can't get them there in a reasonable period of time, they will die. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=245.0s)]
*  If there's no early diagnosis from cancer and no treatment or a child falls down on the playground and really hurts themselves really badly, people are going to get hurt. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=257.0s)]
*  So I can't for the life of me think about why anybody in America thinks it's fair to give the wealthiest people in the country who really don't need it a tax break at the expense of taking life saving health care away from millions of Americans. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=266.0s)]
*  And on top of that, when you're called on it to basically say that you're doing in the name of Jesus Christ, which is just absurd because anybody who professes to know much about that at all will tell you that it's about lifting people up and saving them, not hurting them and then joking about it and being malicious. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=279.0s)]
*  That's where their heart is. And it's really unfortunate that so many congressmen and women are so afraid of Donald Trump. They won't just stand up and say what is so patently obvious and fair for most of the American people. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=296.0s)]
*  And it's really just a damn shame. And Joni, Joni, it should be a shame to herself for that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=308.0s)]
*  Mitch, what opportunities do you see for Democrats to just speak to everybody, you know, to just sort of stand there and say, whoever you voted for, I will never stand here and shrug my shoulders and say that people are going to die and there's nothing I'm going to do. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=313.0s)]
*  Even if I'm in the minority, even if I don't win, right, I'm going to fight for all of you. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=331.0s)]
*  Well, there are certain things that are losing that are worth losing elections over this. Sarah and I have not talked for a long time, but I bet you a lot of money. She'll confirm what I'm about to say. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=336.0s)]
*  If you're doing focus groups and there are there are Trump supporters in those focus groups and you tell them, do you think it's fair to take health care away from working people that are going to threaten their lives in exchange for giving the wealthiest among us the tax break? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=344.0s)]
*  They will say absolutely not. And the same thing is true, by the way, of the tariffs, if and when they go into effect, they think they're not fair. So literally, this is really not anymore. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=358.0s)]
*  We've said this many, many times, and I pray that the people in America will understand this isn't about being a Republican or a Democrat anymore. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=367.0s)]
*  You're witnessing something far more onerous, far more dark than was seen in the history of the country in a long time. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=374.0s)]
*  And shame on the folks for Congress for not stepping up to the plate and who have the power and have the votes and those of us out here, we just have to stand up and be counted every day all day, do whatever it is that you can to push back against us. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=381.0s)]
*  Because fundamentally, most Americans will know this is unfair. And this is not what makes us really great as Americans. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=394.0s)]
*  Sarah, I've noted the absence of Steve Bannon in the Musk-Bannon wars, and this is sort of the part of the MAGA base that Bannon used to be in the room advocating for and protecting people that depended on Medicaid, for whom it was a matter of life and death. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=401.0s)]
*  In Jody Ernst's comments, you sort of see the consequence of his absence. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=416.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, this, first of all, that video of her, it looks, she must be having a nervous breakdown. She is in a cemetery while she is making that joke. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=422.0s)]
*  And one of the first things, one of the first rules about making a joke like that is it should be funny. And there was nothing funny about that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=431.0s)]
*  It was, I think, what the kids call cringe is how it felt. I mean, this is a thing they've learned from Donald Trump, right, is like you say something stupid, you don't apologize, you double down. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=439.0s)]
*  And so that was her doubling down. But this is the kind of thing that Democrats should be all over, because what she did was highlight the thing that is the most pernicious about the bill, which is that people are going to lose Medicaid. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=449.0s)]
*  And Republicans right now are out there desperately trying to convince people that that's not true. They are lying to people about what this bill does because they know that that is going to be deeply unpopular and not just unpopular with Democrats. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=466.0s)]
*  And this is where I think a lot of Republicans are trying to catch up to the fact that their coalition has changed. And it includes now a lot of people who are on Medicare, a lot of people who depend on these social services, a lot of lower income Americans in rural areas. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=480.0s)]
*  And so mocking them. But that's why Trump is very populist about these things. He tries to act all the time like they won't touch these programs. And so her sort of doubling down on this and drawing more attention to the fact that it will do real harm is one of those big PR disasters that I think they think they're being clever on, but is absolutely going to backfire. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=497.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nR2BMQ0hJo&t=527.0s)]
