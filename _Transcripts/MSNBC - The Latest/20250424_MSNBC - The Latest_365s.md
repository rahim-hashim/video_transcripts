# Zelenskyy slams Russia for deadly overnight attack on Kyiv
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY)
*  In past hour breaking overnight Russia pummeled Kiev and other parts of Ukraine with a barrage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=0.0s)]
*  of missiles and drones. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=5.54s)]
*  It was the biggest attack in the capital in months. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=7.16s)]
*  Take a look at these pictures. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=9.4s)]
*  At least 12 people were killed, dozens of others were injured. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=10.68s)]
*  President Trump insisting moments ago that President Putin is listening to him after [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=15.36s)]
*  saying on social media earlier that he is not happy about the Kiev attack and pushing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=19.8s)]
*  Putin to make a deal with Ukraine. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=23.6s)]
*  Just after the president suggested yesterday that President Zelensky is to blame for the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=26.2s)]
*  lack of a deal between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=30.28s)]
*  Both the U.S. and Russia are pushing Ukraine to make territorial concessions, including [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=33.28s)]
*  leaving Crimea in Russian hands. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=37.32s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News Chief Foreign Affairs and Washington correspondent Andrea Mitchell. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  Andrea, always great seeing you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  So, this barrage overnight of missiles and drones was the antithesis of anything that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=46.04s)]
*  could be possibly a light towards peace. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=53.64s)]
*  And it's just inexplicable. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  Putin has all of these advantages. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=60.28s)]
*  He's got a highly favorable peace offer from the U.S. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=62.0s)]
*  He has not agreed to the ceasefire. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=66.72s)]
*  President Zelensky's response today, he was traveling in South Africa when this happened [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=70.4s)]
*  and rushed home because of it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=74.32s)]
*  This response was it's been 44 days since the U.S. proposed a ceasefire and Ukraine, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=77.76s)]
*  Zelensky immediately agreed to it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  And Vladimir Putin has not. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=86.28s)]
*  So now they're not only ramping up the missile barrage, which has been continuous during [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=88.48s)]
*  those 44 days, but attacking Kiev, the capital, which is not something that ordinarily has [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  happened at this stage in the war. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=99.76s)]
*  It certainly signals to the contrary of what the U.S. is saying, of what the president [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=101.84s)]
*  is saying, that Putin wants peace and is ready for peace and that Zelensky, he said last [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=106.64s)]
*  night in an Oval Office photo op, he said, Zelensky has been harder than Putin. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=113.64s)]
*  Well, it's certainly not the case in terms of who's willing to stop the missiles and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=120.24s)]
*  stop shooting and who isn't. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=125.76s)]
*  And so meanwhile, we see that the president's envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to meet [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=129.12s)]
*  with Putin in Russia again tomorrow. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=134.12s)]
*  This is a fourth or fifth meeting. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=136.64s)]
*  What do we know about that? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  And is there the equivalent of that towards the Ukrainians? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=146.2s)]
*  In fact, a high level meeting where there were high officials from Ukraine, the foreign [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=148.32s)]
*  minister and Zelensky's personal representative, Andrei Yermak, were in London for that meeting, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=153.68s)]
*  which was supposed to be with Witkoff and Rubio and the foreign ministers from Germany, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=160.48s)]
*  France and the U.K. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  And instead, it was Rubio announced that he wasn't going and that Witkoff wasn't going. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=167.0s)]
*  Well, that meant the U.S. had called the meeting, that this London meeting was downgraded to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  a meeting of technical experts. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=176.04s)]
*  Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, the special envoy of the president to the State Department, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  represented the U.S. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=183.76s)]
*  But it was not nearly at the level that it would have been. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=184.76s)]
*  The offer itself highly favors Russia because it would let the U.S. recognize the sovereignty [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=189.04s)]
*  of Crimea, which was taken by Russia, invaded and occupied in 2014, and give up probably [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=196.84s)]
*  18 to 20 percent of territory that is considered Ukrainian territory and as well bar Ukraine [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=205.72s)]
*  from ever joining NATO. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=212.24s)]
*  It's not considered a favorable offer at all or an even-handed offer for Ukraine as the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=214.36s)]
*  victim to an aggressor. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=220.0s)]
*  And it's Ukraine that is being asked to pay a very heavy price by signing it and being [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=222.52s)]
*  pressured by, let me just say very quickly, that the implicit threat here is if the president's [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=227.0s)]
*  impatience until today in this overnight strike by Putin, but if his impatience with Zelensky [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  continues to ramp up as it did yesterday, that the real implicit threat is that the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  U.S. would pull out, cut off the talks, and again withdraw military aid and intelligence, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  which would be a terrible blow to Ukraine. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  And Andrea, that intelligence and aid, which could be at least balanced somewhat if the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=253.32s)]
*  United States does pull back on that, by the Europeans, it seems as though, Andrea, curious [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=259.08s)]
*  about your thoughts, how Europe is playing less and less of a role in much of this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=264.92s)]
*  Yes, there are the meetings in Paris and yes, there are the discussions, but in actual help [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=271.32s)]
*  and effective assistance, it seems as though they're not playing a part and Saudi Arabia [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=277.88s)]
*  is playing more of a part. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=285.12s)]
*  Well, the U.S. has cut Europe out completely until just last week there was that first [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=286.12s)]
*  meeting and then the second meeting was supposed to be, as you know, yesterday. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=291.64s)]
*  They're doing it directly and that's because Europe is very critical of this U.S. proposal. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  So as we understand it from, I was talking to European leaders as well, last night, European [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=300.32s)]
*  leaders are really siding with Ukraine that this is not balanced and they've been cut [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=307.4s)]
*  out of it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  They're ready to step up, but they don't have the air defenses and the intel that we [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  can provide or are providing. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=317.08s)]
*  The NATO Secretary General, Mark Rudi, will be meeting at 3 o'clock this afternoon at [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=320.28s)]
*  the State Department with Marco Rubio. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=324.55999999999995s)]
*  I'll be there. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=327.28s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=328.28s)]
*  Andrea, you know, I keep coming back to the fact that when I get a chance to speak with [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=329.28s)]
*  you, I could do this all day because it's always such a treat. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=334.52s)]
*  The feeling is mutual. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=339.0s)]
*  Thanks, Andrea. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=340.0s)]
*  Thank you for saying it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=341.0s)]
*  It's great to speak with you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=342.0s)]
*  You're the best. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=343.0s)]
*  I appreciate your time. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=344.0s)]
*  You as well. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=345.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4myY0NZ5LY&t=349.28s)]
