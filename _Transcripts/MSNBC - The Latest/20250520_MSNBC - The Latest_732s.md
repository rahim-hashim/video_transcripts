# Crisis: Melber on DOJ charging Dem as mayor’s case boomerangs on Trump
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ)
*  But the Trump administration, which is led by a president who promised and vowed political [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=0.0s)]
*  retribution, is going after multiple people in the opposition party. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=4.2s)]
*  Nothing normal about it, a line crossed, and the evidence, for the most part, and we'll [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=10.36s)]
*  get into it, cuts against the idea that this would be a valid or normal charge. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  The New York Times account of the underlying incident puts it simply. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=20.96s)]
*  The Trump DOJ's case turns on claims that have already been contradicted by video footage [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=24.72s)]
*  and by witnesses who are at the scene. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=32.2s)]
*  Now that is a journalistic account. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=35.04s)]
*  It's from the New York Times. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=37.5s)]
*  They are not trying to play ball for one side or the other. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=39.8s)]
*  If you check the Times account of, say, other cases that might involve members of either [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=42.92s)]
*  party, say, one of the recent Democratic members of Congress who faced corruption charges and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=48.04s)]
*  was later convicted, Bob Menendez, you didn't have that kind of really clear rebuttal of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=53.0s)]
*  the underlying case. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=59.68s)]
*  And that's important because part of the game here is trying to create mud or confusion [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=61.56s)]
*  in the perspective of what happened so that you don't really know whether this is a political [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  case. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=71.68s)]
*  And a lot of legal experts, the ACLU today says this is an improper, partisan, political [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=72.68s)]
*  case. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=78.88s)]
*  Now more broadly, we know what Trump campaigned on. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=80.92s)]
*  A lot of times when you deal with allegations of government abuse of power, the person at [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=84.2s)]
*  the top denies it completely, and then you have to go into their mindset and with evidence [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=89.04s)]
*  determine whether there is malicious intent. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=94.98s)]
*  In this instance overall, not this specific member of Congress charge, and we'll get into [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=98.42s)]
*  the details, but overall I would remind you, as a matter of fact, that the current president [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=102.76s)]
*  has already admitted to the goal of abusing power, to target opponents and Democrats, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=107.68s)]
*  to go after people, to intimidate. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  So that's a context for the Justice Department's efforts to charge, try, and potentially jail [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=116.92s)]
*  a federal lawmaker who's in the co-equal branch of government that of course oversees the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  DOJ and DHS and ICE. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=129.8s)]
*  Co-equal. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=132.44s)]
*  So we're dealing with the line crossed in a very big way tonight. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=133.88s)]
*  And a week ago or a month ago, you wouldn't see reporting that this line was crossed because [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  they hadn't gone after members of Congress this way. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=141.56s)]
*  Now the incident happened at that ICE facility. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=146.46s)]
*  You may recall headlines about it, which matters because the federal officials there, while [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=148.98s)]
*  they're not immune from any and anything ever they might do, they are in the heart of their [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=154.92s)]
*  because they have a legal role in overseeing ICE and detention facilities in general. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=161.6s)]
*  That's why they hold hearings. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=167.2s)]
*  That's why they sometimes do site visits and tours and subpoenas and gather evidence. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=168.2s)]
*  And so this ultimately tonight is a troubling case for the separation of powers and the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=172.11999999999998s)]
*  way our government works. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=177.56s)]
*  The DOJ charging this Congresswoman, LaMonica McIver, for what they claim is an assault [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=179.0s)]
*  on federal agents in that situation at the ICE facility. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=186.14s)]
*  There was a clash at this Newark facility. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=189.78s)]
*  The DOJ under Trump is claiming that she did forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=193.14000000000001s)]
*  intimidate and interfere with agents. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=198.3s)]
*  That she was some sort of physical menace against the trained armed group of ICE agents [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=201.1s)]
*  there. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=208.7s)]
*  These charges were announced in a very dramatic way by someone who first and foremost rose [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=210.02s)]
*  to prominence as Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Alina Habba. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=214.18s)]
*  She announced them because she is now in that state of New Jersey, the interim U.S. attorney. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=218.22s)]
*  That's the top federal prosecutor in her district. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=223.54000000000002s)]
*  Journalists identifying that it was a fairly new and inexperienced aide who helped set [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=226.96s)]
*  up these charges and had begun working for Habba just this month. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=231.56s)]
*  That matters because there are a bunch of career, non-partisan folks who do this kind [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=235.46s)]
*  of work. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=240.82000000000002s)]
*  So if they had initiated the charge, which is the normal process, that would be less [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=241.82000000000002s)]
*  suspicious than having all these political people who are directly tied to the president. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=246.66s)]
*  As for the congresswoman, her team says she got the charging document this morning, meaning [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  the effort to get the news out or the online tweets out came first because it was about [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=258.42s)]
*  12 or so hours after the announcement that she, a member of Congress and now a federal [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=264.58s)]
*  defendant, was actually appraised of her rights and the charges. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=269.7s)]
*  She's also said, so this is according to her, that there was an offer of some kind of plea [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=273.18s)]
*  deal, and she's rejecting that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=277.06s)]
*  The first hearing will be tomorrow morning, as she's explaining. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=278.58s)]
*  Representative, can we talk to you about the charges brought against you? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  Look, it's political intimidation, and I'm looking forward to my day in court. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=285.97999999999996s)]
*  Political intimidation. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=291.58s)]
*  Now, if you want to be more skeptical, you have plenty of cases that involve politics, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=293.05999999999995s)]
*  and you hear a lot about the politicians, whoever they may be, saying it's because they're [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=298.29999999999995s)]
*  in politics that they're in any scrutiny at all. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=302.05999999999995s)]
*  But there is other pieces of evidence here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=305.82s)]
*  The Washington Post reporting how this is a highly unusual action by DOJ to charge a [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=307.74s)]
*  sitting member of Congress in an incident where no one was injured. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  That matters again because you look at this and you say there's a line crossed. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=318.53999999999996s)]
*  This isn't about allegations of corruption or personal conduct or some other activities, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=323.74s)]
*  which of course nobody, because of a political job or any other reason, should be above the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=328.5s)]
*  law. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=332.38s)]
*  We've heard that said many times. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=333.38s)]
*  This isn't out there in those kind of ways. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=334.7s)]
*  This is over here in the heart of her duties, in an incident where no one was actually injured, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=336.54s)]
*  but where the DOJ under Trump now wants to say this was about an assault, a battery, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=344.46s)]
*  a hurting of other individuals. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=348.3s)]
*  And so while there can be valid prosecutions of people who happen to be in the opposing [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=350.62s)]
*  party, I mentioned one, Senator Menendez, before, this is beyond suspicious, and it [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=356.21999999999997s)]
*  comes amidst a wider effort. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=361.9s)]
*  So at a certain point, while everyone who cares about fairness and facts doesn't want [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=364.78s)]
*  to assume too much, at a certain point, this isn't the story of one skirmish or one lawmaker. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=368.38s)]
*  It is the escalating story of how the Trump administration, after Trump promised to do [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=374.62s)]
*  it, appears to be doing what he vowed, political retribution, abusing federal power to go after [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=379.41999999999996s)]
*  people with the express intent of scaring them or shutting them up. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=385.65999999999997s)]
*  A lot of experts and other elected officials speaking out along those lines. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=390.54s)]
*  This is not typical to charge a member of Congress, and neither is the way the Justice [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=396.22s)]
*  Department rolled it out. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=399.74s)]
*  Very rare to file charges against a sitting member of Congress. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=400.78000000000003s)]
*  This is not about even what happened there. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=403.90000000000003s)]
*  It's about a fight in this country about due process. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=406.14000000000004s)]
*  It's complete political theater. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=409.66s)]
*  This is a classic example of the administration, the executive branch, weaponizing government. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=411.1s)]
*  And some of the new criticism. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=418.94s)]
*  Now, as I told you, with that context in mind, we can look at the underlying incident, which [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=420.94s)]
*  DOJ wants to treat under Trump as some kind of deliberate premeditated assault, and which [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=425.09999999999997s)]
*  many other accounts are skeptical of. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=431.26s)]
*  The congresswoman was with other lawmakers, both federal and local, visiting the facility. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=433.65999999999997s)]
*  There was a kind of a scrum or a conflict that broke out. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=439.02s)]
*  ICE agents moved to make an arrest that they have now completely dropped of the local mayor [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=441.65999999999997s)]
*  of Newark. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=447.26s)]
*  And McIvor and others are basically seen in what was an unexpected situation, scuffling [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=448.21999999999997s)]
*  or surrounding, and you can use any word you want, you can see it for yourself there, in [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=453.18s)]
*  what was clearly an unexpected chaotic situation because the federal officials have a role [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=457.58s)]
*  in overseeing the very place that they're at. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=463.65999999999997s)]
*  And now the federal agents seem to be clashing with them. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=465.42s)]
*  Now, in a back and forth clash, reasonable people, reasonable jurors can debate who's [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=468.7s)]
*  pushing who and who's reacting or who's out of control. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=472.78s)]
*  There's also footage that was posted on social media that shows McIvor asking officers [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=476.62s)]
*  basically stop touching us. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=481.1s)]
*  Again, if this were a congressional hearing, some of the same federal agents would have [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=483.34000000000003s)]
*  the duty of keeping security and protecting the members of Congress. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=486.86s)]
*  Here it became kind of, as you see, a pretty tense grouping of people, and she's talking [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=490.62s)]
*  there. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=496.14s)]
*  Now, the other mayor, who was also quoted in the montage I just played for you, matters [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=497.26s)]
*  a lot in this because there was a case, you may have heard about it, you follow the news, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=502.94s)]
*  that the feds brought, which is a lesser charge, a very, what lawyers call a ticky-tack or [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=508.78000000000003s)]
*  kind of silly charge, of the mayor trespassing. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=513.42s)]
*  Again, that's unusual. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=516.7s)]
*  It could happen, right, if he ran into someone's home, but usually when you're the mayor and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=518.54s)]
*  you go to a government facility in public, you know, with your aides in a formal way, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=522.14s)]
*  you don't usually get a federal trespassing charge. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=526.38s)]
*  And that's what the DOJ initially tried against Newark Mayor Ross Baraka. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=528.7s)]
*  That case fell apart. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=532.94s)]
*  If that was their big opening gambit against a Democrat, it already completely collapsed [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=534.94s)]
*  because the DOJ has dropped those charges. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=541.58s)]
*  And if you're thinking, wow, there's so much going on, how do you keep track? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=543.98s)]
*  Well, that's new. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=546.38s)]
*  If it sounds new, it is new. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=547.42s)]
*  That was just last night. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=548.46s)]
*  Flimsy charges, as the New York Times reported, Baraka was actually initially allowed past [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=550.14s)]
*  the fence. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=555.1s)]
*  That's kind of the opposite of trespassing. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=555.66s)]
*  Then, quote, invited past the gates before he was arrested, seemingly contradicting the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=557.8199999999999s)]
*  accusations that came more from Trump DOJ that he had, quote, barged into the facility [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=563.3399999999999s)]
*  without permission. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=567.18s)]
*  He was then asked to leave multiple times and exited voluntarily. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=568.14s)]
*  Top Democrats, experienced and serious people saying, the line is crossed, we have a problem. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=572.4599999999999s)]
*  The ACLU, nonpartisan, calling this an autocratic and clearly political type of crackdown. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=578.06s)]
*  And then if you want to talk about the footage where you say things did look a little out [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=584.7s)]
*  of control and not like the ideal government oversight, that's fair. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=588.14s)]
*  People can criticize all sorts of ways that politicians in both parties exercise their [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=592.46s)]
*  duties. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=597.58s)]
*  But legal experts do not see this as a traditional or fair-minded prosecution. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=598.86s)]
*  And we've seen members of both parties do all kinds of things that sometimes get unwieldy [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=604.38s)]
*  in their political politicking and oversight. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=610.0600000000001s)]
*  Even when those actions were terminated in one case, for example, a Republican riot, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=613.5s)]
*  the Brooks Brothers riot around election debates, or Republican operatives were basically [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=617.98s)]
*  storming the place. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=623.5s)]
*  You could call that local trespassing, arguing that ballots should be treated differently. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=624.3s)]
*  That's on the Republican side. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=628.9399999999999s)]
*  Or you had MTG and Matt Gaetz, who showed up very aggressively at a federal prison where [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=630.2199999999999s)]
*  they wanted to make a point about January 6. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=636.54s)]
*  Again, you could criticize that. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=638.86s)]
*  And some people said there were aspects of it that were in poor taste or misleading. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=640.7s)]
*  But you don't typically have, under administrations in both parties previously, arrests made even [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=644.7s)]
*  for these kind of raucous events. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=651.1s)]
*  In 2020, Democrats said they wanted to do a kind of a sit-in and kneel in parts of the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=653.34s)]
*  Capitol. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=658.46s)]
*  And again, people can like or dislike the image on the screen. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=660.46s)]
*  But we are in a country that deals with that kind of political activity by rounding up [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=663.9000000000001s)]
*  lawmakers and threatening them with jail time. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=668.78s)]
*  That's why we're witnessing this major departure. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=671.5799999999999s)]
*  There is a high burden of proof when you deal in these kind of situations. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=674.86s)]
*  The line is crossed. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=679.02s)]
*  All of the hypotheticals about what will we do as a country if we get to this point under Trump? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=680.6999999999999s)]
*  We're here now. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=685.98s)]
*  One of the cases already fell apart. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=687.18s)]
*  That tells you something about the power of evidence, videos, facts, the mayor's case, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=688.6999999999999s)]
*  gone, but replaced quite quickly, quite suspiciously, to be frank, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=694.14s)]
*  by a DOJ that seems hell-bent on moving forward on these kind of unusual cases [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=698.54s)]
*  against sitting officials. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iKARhcXtQ&t=703.5799999999999s)]
