# How Donald Trump’s ‘violent crime’ rhetoric created chaos in California
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s)
*  Joining us now, MSNBC political analyst Anthony Coley. He's the former director for the Office [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=0.0s)]
*  of Public Affairs at the Biden DOJ and Max Boot, a senior fellow for national security studies at [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=5.92s)]
*  the Council on Foreign Relations and a columnist for The Washington Post. Thank you both for joining [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=11.6s)]
*  us as we work on this and think about and talk about this breaking news. Gavin Newsom tweeted out, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=16.32s)]
*  the federal government is sowing chaos so they can have an excuse to escalate. We saw President [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=23.2s)]
*  Trump sign this memo yesterday invoking Title 10. Max, talk about that. Is the President, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=29.12s)]
*  do you agree with Governor Newsom sowing chaos so they have an excuse to escalate? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=36.56s)]
*  Well, it sure seems like Governor Newsom is compelling in his analysis. I mean, if you [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=41.44s)]
*  kind of zoom out to the 20,000 foot view, I mean, what is provoking this confrontation in LA? It's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=47.84s)]
*  the fact that the Trump administration is sending out these heavily armed federal agents in body, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=54.96s)]
*  armor and face masks, in many cases with assault weapons and tactical gear, to round up construction [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=60.32s)]
*  workers, to round up bus boys, to round up hardworking immigrants, some of whom may be [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=67.28s)]
*  undocumented but who are contributing to our economy and are in many cases paying sales taxes, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  paying social security taxes, essentially helping to make America great, to coin a phrase. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=79.84s)]
*  And suddenly the Trump White House has imposed these quotas on ICE to go out and they're demanding [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=87.92s)]
*  more and more roundups. And so I think it was kind of inevitable that you would see this kind of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=93.68s)]
*  confrontation and pushback because they're now going to these workplaces and in heavily [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=97.92s)]
*  Latino working class communities like Paramount in Southern California. And so [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=103.28s)]
*  they're not shying away from the confrontation. They seem to be causing the confrontation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=109.84s)]
*  And you can just see that President Trump revels in the strongman image of, you know, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=115.04s)]
*  there's chaos on the streets, send out the troops, that is imagery that mobilizes his base and that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=119.2s)]
*  accumulates even more power in the White House. So there's no question that the White House [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=128.08s)]
*  is provoking this. And it's a very delicate and very inflammatory situation that could [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=133.2s)]
*  very easily spiral out of control. And today, as we've mentioned many times, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=144.0s)]
*  the border czar is in Los Angeles. And NBC's Jacob Soboroff had a chance to talk to him yesterday. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=149.28s)]
*  Let's play a bit of their conversation and talk about it on the other side. Watch this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=156.32s)]
*  What is the federal military mission in Los Angeles? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=163.76s)]
*  This is a military mission. The president's bringing national guards here to protect the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=167.04s)]
*  public and protect officers. We have officers who have been attacked. We have officers who are injured. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=170.16s)]
*  So he's standing here as a force multiplier for law enforcement here, but not just to protect the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  law enforcement, but to protect the general public. If Democratic leaders want to turn their back on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  public safety, they can. President Trump's not going to. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=183.83999999999997s)]
*  You said it's not a military mission, but isn't that what Title X is? Or am I misunderstanding something? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=186.56s)]
*  They're here for a law enforcement mission to protect the public and protect law enforcement. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=190.56s)]
*  That's what it is. Antony, you are the former DOJ official [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=195.84s)]
*  at the table. Is the border czar correct? Let me just say for the record, this guy just [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=200.72s)]
*  so happens to be on the ground in Southern California at the moment. This is not a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=206.88s)]
*  coincidence. This is carefully orchestrated. And what's striking to me is just these images, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=212.0s)]
*  to Elise's point, these images are bad. The rhetoric coming out of the Trump administration [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=217.36s)]
*  is bad, but neither the images or the rhetoric match what's really happening on the ground [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=222.08s)]
*  across the country. On this particular issue, 2,000 troops, there have been 12 arrests, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=227.12s)]
*  right? That is completely disproportionate. And Donald Trump says the reason he is cracking down [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=234.24s)]
*  on this entire issue in terms of immigration is because violent criminals, undocumented, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=240.24s)]
*  illegal aliens are infiltrating American neighborhoods. The fact of the matter is [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=246.88s)]
*  that violent crime in this country is at record lows. That started, you mentioned, in the Biden [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=253.6s)]
*  administration, that started in the Biden administration. I was in the room with U.S. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=258.48s)]
*  attorneys across the country when they were announcing their tailored programs, crime [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=263.2s)]
*  prevention programs, to bring down, to arrest the curve of violent crime. And we're seeing the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=270.64s)]
*  benefits of that just up the street in Baltimore, right? They have very few homicides at this [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=276.8s)]
*  moment. It's like record low homicides. So my point here is that Donald Trump creates all of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  these, this rhetoric. He's using this rhetoric about an invasion of illegal immigrants when [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=289.12s)]
*  the fact of the matter is that violent crime is at a low. Record lows. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=296.88s)]
*  Hi. Let's bring in NBC News correspondent Steve Patterson in Los Angeles. Steve, I hope that you [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=300.88s)]
*  managed to get a bit of sleep. The last I saw you last night, you were wearing a gas mask while you [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=307.04s)]
*  were reporting because so much tear gas was going on, was coming down around you. Talk about what [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=312.72s)]
*  you're seeing and what you're hearing on the ground. Yeah, still suffering from the tear gas [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  this morning, unfortunately. You know, most of the protests that we saw, at least when we were on [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=324.8s)]
*  the ground in Paramount, most of them were people peacefully protesting, just sort of standing there. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  A lot of insults, of course, hurled at police that were obviously trying to push back against [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=334.32s)]
*  demonstrators spilling out into the street. And that's really what the source of the conflict was. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=339.76s)]
*  By the time we got there, a lot of these guys are local police. They are sheriff's department. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=345.12s)]
*  They are in an assistant role and they really wanted to make that clear in statements that [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  they offer. Sheriff Luna with the LA County Sheriff's Department really saying that they [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=354.56s)]
*  were there just to handle the demonstrations. They were not part of any of these federal raids. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=358.88s)]
*  LAPD sort of echoing the same sentiment. Yet, obviously, these clashes are really tense. We [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=364.08s)]
*  saw that last night at the detention center. About nine o'clock last night, another unlawful [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=369.12s)]
*  assembly declared. You see the car on fire there. That's Paramount. You know, as these sort of things [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  escalate and then the police line starts forming and start pushing back on people. And then those [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=379.04s)]
*  irritants and the nonlethal weaponry fired into the crowd and things get really, really bad. And [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=384.0s)]
*  that's what we saw, obviously, all throughout the day yesterday. But as far as the federal raids go, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=389.68s)]
*  you know, the protests really have been a jumping off point at these flashpoint locations. And I [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=395.04s)]
*  think, obviously, with the escalation that the National Guard coming in offers, I think a lot [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=400.0s)]
*  of people only worry that that is going to worsen the situation is going to make it worse [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=405.28s)]
*  and not better. And that's what we've been hearing from, obviously, you know, the elected officials, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=410.55999999999995s)]
*  the Gavin Newsom, Mayor Bass, but certainly from protesters, too, who believe that, you know, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=416.08s)]
*  they're going to fight back against anything that authorities wheel out. And this will only be [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=423.2s)]
*  another escalation in that, guys. Steve, Steve, Steve, on that on that point about the protesters, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=427.84s)]
*  I'm wondering how many protesters are we talking about? Are we talking about [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=432.8s)]
*  a few dozen, hundreds, thousands? Give us a sense of how many people you saw when you were on the [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=438.24s)]
*  ground. Yeah, I mean, look, these these locations are so vast and so split up. Paramount, for example, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  the place you're looking at right now on screen, right, there's a checkpoint above at sort of the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=451.52s)]
*  light, the intersection where that shot was, where there's kind of a perspective into the sunset, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=456.0s)]
*  a few dozen there, a few dozen near that car, a few dozen outside of the Home Depot. That's where [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=461.04s)]
*  you're seeing right there, that black fence and very familiar with that scene right there. And [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=466.88s)]
*  then a few dozen at the intersection where again, LA County was sort of stationed trying to push [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=471.52000000000004s)]
*  people back from heading to a scene like that, where that cloud of smoke that you're looking at [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  on screen right there, that is tear gas. And if you're in that, you can certainly feel it. So [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=481.04s)]
*  certain dozens of protesters all across the scene like that. And then when you head downtown into LA, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=486.56s)]
*  those dozens turn into hundreds, which can be, I think, a little tougher authorities to get a [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=492.32s)]
*  handle on, especially when you're spread out in multiple locations. And there are agitators, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=496.72s)]
*  of course, in every crowd. Most of the crowds, again, that I saw that I spoke to, that I was [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=500.8s)]
*  interacting with, these are peaceful people that want to get their message across. They brought [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=505.36s)]
*  signs. They're out with families in some places. And others are obviously more agitant, have the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=509.92s)]
*  mask on, and reportedly, I didn't see this, but reportedly throwing things back at authorities [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=515.68s)]
*  that are trying to do their jobs as well. So it's sort of a varied up and down, sort of a [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=522.4s)]
*  back and forth between how many are in the crowd and how many are not. But I would say dozens at [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=528.16s)]
*  all the locations that we've seen. Steve, you've been doing great reporting. Thank you. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=533.8399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAJg-2NG5s&t=545.68s)]
