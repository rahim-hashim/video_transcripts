*  Others were able to get in and see this damage and the desperation in firsthand [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=25.88s)]
*  Dr. Clayton Dalton among them. He's an emergency [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=31.4s)]

*  For the New Yorker entitled hospitals in ruin and dr. Clayton Dalton is joining us now [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time. Dr. Dalton [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=48.36s)]
*  Describe the devastation you saw in Gaza like nothing you've ever seen before [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=51.64s)]
*  Given your background as an emergency physician walk us through what that means for you [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=57.6s)]
*  It's great to be with you on I thank you [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=64.32s)]
*  It's hard to describe and I mean [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=67.64s)]
*  Every every aspect of the health care delivery system was was touched by destruction in some way. It wasn't a question of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=71.08s)]
*  whether or not [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=78.36s)]
*  Components had been damaged or facilities have been damaged. It was just a matter of degree [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=80.08s)]
*  Some of them were functional in the midst of the rubble. Some of them had been completely destroyed absolutely beyond repair [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=85.24s)]
*  Supplies were limited [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  Gaza's in short supply antibiotics were in short supply everything that you would need to take care of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=96.84s)]
*  Patients in this in this environment towards in short supply and this was during the ceasefire [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=101.96s)]
*  This was when medical aid was actually coming in and and still it wasn't enough [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=106.0s)]
*  So I've been in touch with people that I worked alongside who are [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  Palatine health care workers who are still there and they say that it's it's just so much worse, which is hard for me to imagine [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  I mean this was already [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  Beyond anything that I'd ever ever seen before the circumstances they're working in are just so [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  Difficult what brought you to Gaza what inspired you to go there a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=126.36s)]
*  Sense of being able to make some contribution [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=130.56s)]
*  to be able to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=136.08s)]
*  Support them [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=138.08s)]
*  Medically to be able to tell their story that was actually the thing that people asked me to do when I was there [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=139.52s)]
*  The health care workers I worked alongside they were they were so glad to have us there to just to help medically [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=145.36s)]
*  But so many people dozens of people said please just tell [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=150.96s)]
*  The world about what is happening here. Tell them what you see tell them tell them what's happening [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=154.96s)]
*  What's happening here? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=159.52s)]
*  And that's what I've tried to do [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=162.08s)]
*  In your New Yorker video diary [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=165.52s)]
*  There was a doctor who was giving you an inside tour of the damaged ICU who points out medical equipment that had appeared to have been [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=167.44s)]
*  Systematically disabled with bullet holes. I want to play a portion of that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=175.84s)]
*  Took me up into the ICU and showed me a number of different pieces of medical equipment and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=182.08s)]
*  all of them [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=189.44s)]
*  seemed to have a [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=191.04s)]
*  Bullet hole in the screen [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=194.24s)]
*  I don't he was like I don't understand and I I get that I also was struggling to understand [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  This didn't seem like collateral damage to me, you know, these were specific [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=205.08s)]
*  pieces of medical equipment that seems to have been [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=209.48s)]
*  systematically disabled [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=215.12s)]
*  The IDF denies that they specifically targeted medical equipment, but what was your takeaway from this? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=217.84s)]
*  This is horrible, I mean I wasn't I wasn't there when these machines were destroyed I [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=227.56s)]
*  Don't know exactly what happened. I can say that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=233.8s)]
*  The the implication that was shared with me by [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=237.8s)]
*  Dr. Marantz-Foltan who you can see in the video who's the director of the hospital was that he discovered [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=240.96s)]
*  He discovered this damage after soldiers had been active in hospital facility [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=246.4s)]
*  And the idea did deny that that they destroy medical equipment in this way, but it was extremely disturbing [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=252.32s)]
*  It's hard for me to understand any sort of justification for this kind of targeted destruction [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=258.64s)]
*  So much destruction and chaos that I know you witness firsthand that we've seen in the images [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=264.36s)]
*  But you also describe witnessing moments of normalcy [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=269.56s)]
*  Seeing a family congregate over tea children laughing and playing and even flying kites [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=272.76s)]
*  These have to be incredibly dark times for them. And yet what resilience what? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=279.44s)]
*  Perseverance, what did you learn about the spirit of the people there? What do our viewers need to know? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=286.36s)]
*  It was extremely humbling I [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=292.52s)]
*  Saw this in the healthcare workers that I worked alongside in the civilians who were still trying to make a life in this place [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=295.2s)]
*  They were they were kind they were welcoming they were generous [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=301.44s)]
*  They would always be sure that we ate first which made me extremely uncomfortable [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=306.0s)]
*  But there was no negotiating that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=310.6s)]
*  And there's there's so many children nearly half the population of Gaza, which is about two million people is children [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=313.64000000000004s)]
*  And they're just finding a way to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=320.24s)]
*  To live as children in the rubble. They're finding ways to play and to laugh. It's it's what children do [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=323.0s)]
*  I think it's it was so important to me to remember that you know [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=329.6s)]
*  We're exposed to these scenes of destruction of famine and it's so important that we stay aware and conscious of what's happening there [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=333.48s)]
*  But we also have to remember that that these are people just like us and they're trying to live their lives here [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=340.92s)]
*  I think we have to remember the humanity of the people who are here [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  Dr. Clayton Dalton. Thank you so much for sharing what you witnessed sharing your reporting and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  First-hand accounts of what you saw it's so important and we we really value your time today. Thank you [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=356.64s)]
*  Thank you. Good to be with you [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxy8YmaHNOM&t=363.8s)]
