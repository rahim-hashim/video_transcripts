# Dr. Kavita Patel on Biden’s cancer diagnosis: 'All in all, the road ahead is going to be tough.'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I)
*  Joining us now is MSNBC medical contributor and former Obama White House policy director, Dr. Kavita Patel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=0.0s)]
*  Dr. Patel, thank you so much for joining us. This is being described as an aggressive form of cancer [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=6.94s)]
*  What does that mean? How common is it? How easy is it to treat? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=14.32s)]
*  Yeah, so the kind of cancer just a Gleason score of nine which we can break down how they get that score exactly [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=18.12s)]
*  Indicates that it is not only aggressive [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=25.26s)]
*  But it can come on somewhat suddenly brings questions up like when was the president's last exam? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=27.46s)]
*  When or if he had any prostate screening which I would imagine at some point recently he has so we know that this is one [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=33.300000000000004s)]
*  Aggressive to hormone responsive which is a good sign and that means that he can have what we call androgen [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=40.82s)]
*  Depriving therapy to kind of take away and counter some of the interaction of what might be making that cancer grow pretty aggressively [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=47.22s)]
*  That all in all leads to I think just a combination of treatment options [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  That's why he's consulting several doctors in terms of how common this is a more rare form [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=58.64s)]
*  It is more aggressive that spread to the bone [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=62.540000000000006s)]
*  It doesn't say which bone or which part of his body, but I imagine we'll be getting some of those details [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=65.22s)]
*  I think all in all the road ahead is going to be tough when people go through treatment for this type of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=70.02s)]
*  Grade of cancer it can be months and months to even two years and long-term survival given what little we know [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  And I'm just going based off of the statement that we have from the president himself [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=83.2s)]
*  Survival rates can be anywhere five years about 20 to 30 percent [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=87.64s)]
*  And I think all of us in medicine have seen cases all over the map [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=91.4s)]
*  So he's actually pretty healthy going into this and that should hopefully be a good prognosis for him [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=95.42s)]
*  Even though it's spread to his bones. It's still a believe or not very treatable [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  I know that sometimes that kind of thinking of well if it's spread then it's far gone [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=103.88s)]
*  Believe it or not the advances in therapy and the fact that it's hormone responsive [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=108.84s)]
*  Which I think is part of why they put that out there that there's actually not only a plethora of treatment options [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=113.12s)]
*  But this is something in fact even at this aggressive stage of cancer [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=118.04s)]
*  But I've seen with when people unfortunately have a serious illness. It's not from the cancer. It's from something else [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=121.64s)]
*  So this is something that we'll be watching very carefully to see how they put a treatment plan together [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=127.44s)]
*  Can I ask you about the diagnosis because I assume as somebody who was just leading the office of the presidency [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=132.0s)]
*  This was somebody who was probably checked pretty regularly and it's only been a couple of months [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=136.44s)]
*  I'm sure he's probably gotten some routine physicals as well [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=140.4s)]
*  But how how often is somebody screened at that age for? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=142.56s)]
*  Potential prostate cancer and more importantly the fact that they are identifying it being so serious right after him noticing urinary symptoms [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=147.24s)]
*  Just earlier in the week because they said he came in for treatment for urinary symptoms by Friday [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=155.4s)]
*  He was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Yeah that presentation of kind of those urinary symptoms is not that unusual [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=160.16s)]
*  That's actually usually how we kind of find not necessarily prostate cancer [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=166.04s)]
*  But that can be how we detect a more aggressive form of prostate cancer or patient will have symptoms that come on pretty suddenly [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=169.92s)]
*  But to your point amen about I one would imagine I did go back through his publicly released medical records and did not see [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=175.76s)]
*  The prostate specific antigen which is one of the blood tests that can be used to detect prostate cancer [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=181.94s)]
*  I did not see that publicly revealed. He didn't have his entire physical down to that breakdown one would imagine [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=186.56s)]
*  He's had that now at that age it [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  Anybody that the president's age we kind of have like a risk-benefit analysis about whether or not we screen if someone is healthy [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=195.6s)]
*  Which again he's very healthy from a cardiovascular kind of overall assessment [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=202.88s)]
*  He would fit into probably that criteria of someone that I would say mr. President [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=208.28s)]
*  You know this is part of what we would do is routine screening [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=212.08s)]
*  But I have seen cases where you do have a clear prostate specific antigen [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  It's not perfect as a screening mechanism, and then you do see an aggressive form of cancer [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=219.02s)]
*  But to go back to the issue of the screening the fact that it wasn't publicly released does that mean it was tested but not [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=224.72s)]
*  Released or possibly because I did see that they had released cholesterol [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  They they would release certain they had done to something very granular, but they didn't do it for this one. It's possible [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's what unfortunately. That's what it's hard to imagine right really difficult to imagine [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=240.48s)]
*  He hasn't been screened for can you break down for us the options ahead of the former president and his family right now [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=244.85999999999999s)]
*  What are they likely considering this weekend? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=250.94s)]
*  Yeah, so the score kind of helps with what options he might have and just because who would understand what a score Gleason of nine [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=252.96s)]
*  Means without any frame of reference so the highest score is about a ten they get that score by taking kind of biopsies from the cancer [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=260.2s)]
*  looking at the cells under the microscope and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=268.36s)]
*  Prostate cancer cells when they look healthy and normal look one way [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=271.16s)]
*  But when you see cancer you see a bunch of different kinds of cell appearances [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  They take the appearance of kind of the more to most typical cells add that number together and the highest you can get [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=277.32s)]
*  What a combination is ten his was a nine, but it's also hormone sensitive [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=284.56s)]
*  So it does indicate that it's aggressive and spread and pretty high grade [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=287.8s)]
*  Treatment options then pursuing from that can be a combination of radiation surgery [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=293.32s)]
*  Chemotherapy and of course some sort of androgen deprivation therapy, which is in response to the hormone sensitivity [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=298.32s)]
*  Is there anything that you would take off the table in terms of treatment for somebody who is 82 years old? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=304.2s)]
*  No, the surgery might not be an option for him because it can leave him with more symptoms [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=308.2s)]
*  We try to really sense the fact that you know, you can do some things that make things worse [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  So I think that's exactly why he's getting probably multiple opinions and not not unusual [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=317.4s)]
*  And whenever you tell a patient they have cancer no matter who it is. That's the only word they hear [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=322.32s)]
*  So it does take some time, of course [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=326.74s)]
*  All right, dr. Kavita Patel. Thank you so much greatly appreciate your insights on this [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=329.48s)]
*  We'll be talking to you throughout the course of the evening [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS851qYFm8I&t=332.64s)]
