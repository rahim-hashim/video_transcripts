# Eric Holder: ‘It may come down to the American people hitting the streets’ if Trump defies the law
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8)
*  This was another intense week in the ongoing clashes between President Donald Trump and the courts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=0.0s)]
*  Federal judge blocked Trump's efforts to deport Asian migrants to war-torn Libya, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  claiming it would clearly violate a court order. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=11.9s)]
*  Another federal judge used Trump's own words against the Justice Department's argument [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=16.1s)]
*  that the administration has no control over the hundreds of migrants it already deported [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=20.5s)]
*  to a maximum security prison in El Salvador. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=25.7s)]
*  Now this comes as Trump's deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=29.200000000000003s)]
*  said yesterday that the administration is, quote, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  actively looking at suspending habeas corpus, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  the right for anyone in this country to challenge the legality of their detention by the government. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  And there were these stunning comments from Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=45.5s)]
*  on the Trump administration's recent attacks on judges and lawyers [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  at an event hosted by the American Bar Association. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=53.8s)]
*  She said, in part, in all of the uncertainty that exists at this moment, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=57.0s)]
*  this is our time to stand up and be heard. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=61.8s)]
*  She added, right now, we can't lose the battles we are facing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=65.1s)]
*  Joining us now is the former Attorney General of the United States, Eric Holder. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=70.5s)]
*  He's also the chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=75.2s)]
*  Attorney General Holder, as always, thank you very much for coming. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=79.3s)]
*  Good to see you, and congratulations to all of you on this new and great show. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=82.6s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=86.0s)]
*  So let's talk about the Stephen Miller of it all, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=87.5s)]
*  talking about ending habeas corpus for migrants. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=89.9s)]
*  To me, saying that it's just for migrants is like the gateway to just ending it completely. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=94.0s)]
*  But he also wasn't very specific about this migrants. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  He said ending habeas corpus. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=102.0s)]
*  It's all about intimidation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  To put that out there, to put that out as a conversation piece [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  for people to think that it may be for migrants, it may be larger than that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=109.0s)]
*  But Stephen Miller, I don't think he's a lawyer, and he clearly doesn't understand our history. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=114.1s)]
*  I think we've only suspended habeas corpus maybe four times. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=118.3s)]
*  The last time, I think, was after the attacks on Pearl Harbor. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=121.3s)]
*  There's the need to show that there's an invasion and also a threat to public safety. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=125.7s)]
*  And so I don't think there are the necessary conditions to have that happen. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=130.2s)]
*  But you also have to have Congress be engaged in the process. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=133.5s)]
*  Lincoln suspended habeas corpus, and it's a blot on his record. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=137.4s)]
*  I think he did it while Congress was, I think, in recess, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=142.4s)]
*  but I think was affirmed ultimately by Congress there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=145.8s)]
*  So this is something that a non-lawyer, a zealot, an ideologue is putting out there, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=149.0s)]
*  I think, for intimidation purposes as opposed to something that is ultimately realistic. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=155.4s)]
*  So far we've had Justice Katanji Brown Jackson last weekend speaking out [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  about the administration's backsliding on rule of law. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=165.5s)]
*  And then we had Justice Sotomayor and also Justice John Roberts, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=169.0s)]
*  which I feel is particularly notable. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=173.4s)]
*  The Constitution judges and the judiciary is a co-equal branch of government [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=175.8s)]
*  separate from the others with the authority to interpret the Constitution as law. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=180.6s)]
*  Its job is to obviously decide cases, but in the course of that, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=186.9s)]
*  check the excesses of Congress or of the executive, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  and that does require a degree of independence. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=196.6s)]
*  So how extraordinary do you make of this moment [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=204.2s)]
*  where you have Supreme Court justices speaking out? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=207.6s)]
*  Well, I think it's extremely important that all lawyers, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=210.9s)]
*  and especially those who are in positions of power, speak out for the rule of law. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=214.2s)]
*  That's the foundation for everything that makes this nation exceptional. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=218.6s)]
*  And when you have the Chief Justice, two justices of the Supreme Court, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=221.9s)]
*  speaking out for the rule of law, for that which makes this country, as I said, exceptional, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=225.7s)]
*  that is an important thing. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=231.5s)]
*  But it's not only them. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  I think lawyers all across the spectrum and in whatever positions they are [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=233.89999999999998s)]
*  have to be leaders in this fight to preserve the rule of law. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=237.1s)]
*  It's why it's so disheartening to see law firms that have cut deals with this administration [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=240.5s)]
*  and essentially turned their backs on the rule of law. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=245.89999999999998s)]
*  You know, I was part of a group that was trying to put together an amicus curi brief [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=248.89999999999998s)]
*  to support a firm that had been hit with one of these executive orders. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=252.4s)]
*  And we were only able to get 10 of the top 100 law firms to sign onto that brief, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=256.3s)]
*  my firm among them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=261.1s)]
*  But 90 of those firms did not sign. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=262.5s)]
*  90 out of 100 of the top 10 firms. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=265.5s)]
*  And that's something that I think, you know, this is going to end. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=267.90000000000003s)]
*  This is going to end come 2029. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=270.7s)]
*  And people are going to ask institutions and individuals, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  where did you stand in 2025, 26, 27, 28? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=275.3s)]
*  And a lot of these firms, a lot of these individuals who will not stand up for the rule of law now [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=279.8s)]
*  will damage their reputations. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=286.2s)]
*  And I think the commercial interests, perhaps irreparably. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=288.2s)]
*  Do you think those folks, especially maybe the Democrats, the senior partners [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=290.8s)]
*  who are kind of not standing up, the ones that didn't sign onto that letter with you, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=294.2s)]
*  should they leave? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=298.3s)]
*  Should they, do they need to resign? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=299.8s)]
*  Do they need to go? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=301.5s)]
*  You know, that's for their firms to decide. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=302.6s)]
*  They made their own decisions, I suspect, for business reasons [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=305.3s)]
*  as opposed to other things. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=308.2s)]
*  But at some point, at some point, as lawyers, we are protectors of our system, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=310.3s)]
*  of our judicial system. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=314.8s)]
*  And commercial interests have to take, I think, a backseat to that protection that we give. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=316.7s)]
*  Lawyers have lots of, get lots of privileges. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=320.8s)]
*  But I think lawyers also have enormous responsibilities. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=323.8s)]
*  And it was extremely disappointing and surprising to see that lack of support [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=326.5s)]
*  for fellow practitioners of the law against executive orders that are facially invalid. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=332.3s)]
*  And every time they've been tested by a court, by a judge, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=338.9s)]
*  they have been found to be unconstitutional. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=342.8s)]
*  And that was pretty obvious. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=344.5s)]
*  And yet we have seen time and time again the administration, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=345.9s)]
*  the president and his administration defying court orders. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=349.5s)]
*  Now, we know that they're doing all of this because they're trying to push the limits, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  see how far they can go, how much they can get away with. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=358.4s)]
*  But do you think the system can handle the president openly defying, say, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=362.1s)]
*  a firm Supreme Court ruling to not do something? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=369.3s)]
*  He has said that, oh, the Supreme Court says that, of course, I'll abide by a Supreme Court ruling. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=375.3s)]
*  But do you believe that? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=381.3s)]
*  And then what should happen if he does defy a Supreme Court ruling? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=382.5s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's the nightmare scenario, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=387.8s)]
*  where you have the Supreme Court telling the executive branch to do something [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  and the executive branch refuses to do that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't think we're going to get to that point. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=394.9s)]
*  I pray that we don't get to that point. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=396.4s)]
*  Why don't you think we're going to get to that point? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=397.9s)]
*  Because I think the system is going to hold. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=399.4s)]
*  I think I'll take, in this instance, I'll take the president at his word [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=401.0s)]
*  that a Supreme Court ruling would be something that he would abide by. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=405.0s)]
*  Were he not to do that, I would hope that the courts produce all the powers that they have, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=409.4s)]
*  hold people in contempt, fine people, potentially put people in jail who do not follow orders, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=413.5s)]
*  especially coming from the Supreme Court. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=418.7s)]
*  But at the end of the day, it may come down to the American people hitting the streets, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=420.4s)]
*  hitting the streets. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=424.09999999999997s)]
*  This is a former attorney general talking about hitting the streets and protesting [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=425.5s)]
*  and doing things, obviously, in as peaceful a way as is possible. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=429.3s)]
*  But the American people are the ultimate backstop against an executive branch [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=432.59999999999997s)]
*  that is not following the rules. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=436.7s)]
*  Do you think Judge Boesberg will find members of the Trump administration [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=439.5s)]
*  in either criminal contempt in the Venezuela case? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=443.9s)]
*  They're certainly making it relatively easy for him to do that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=448.7s)]
*  I mean, you know, he keeps giving, he's a very patient man. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=452.4s)]
*  And I was a judge, I'm not as all certain that I would let this go on as long as he is, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=455.2s)]
*  but I will defer to him. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=459.09999999999997s)]
*  But the way in which they are conducting themselves in front of him is not consistent [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=461.79999999999995s)]
*  with the way in which you would want to have an executive branch conduct itself, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=467.79999999999995s)]
*  a justice department conduct itself. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=471.7s)]
*  And the thing that really I think is striking is that whatever the Justice Department lawyers [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=473.6s)]
*  are saying is undermined by what the president is saying in his press interactions, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=478.0s)]
*  and then they have to somehow deal with that in front of, you know, Judge Boesberg. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=483.3s)]
*  Well, and that's something I wanted to ask you. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=487.3s)]
*  So President Trump has said that he cannot bring back Garcia, who is a prisoner, Miguel, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=488.70000000000005s)]
*  I think, yeah, exactly. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=497.20000000000005s)]
*  He said, oh, I can't do it. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=500.1s)]
*  I can't bring him back. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=501.90000000000003s)]
*  Does that actually help the case in court down the road that he has been, you know, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=503.2s)]
*  that he suffered and might even, you know, be able to get damages for the government [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  holding him when it is clearly deemed inappropriate and wrong? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=512.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, the president says we can't bring him back, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=518.4s)]
*  but then he says, well, we're paying them $4 million to hold these people. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=521.2s)]
*  And then he said, we can't bring him back. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=524.8s)]
*  Then he says, we can't bring him back. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=525.8s)]
*  I could. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=526.8s)]
*  I just have to make a phone call and I could bring him back. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=527.3s)]
*  And so I think at the end of the day, it's pretty clear that if the administration wants [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=529.8000000000001s)]
*  to, they can get him and any other people, you know, out of that gulag in El Salvador. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=533.9000000000001s)]
*  And I think this is something that will be a stain on this administration. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=539.6s)]
*  And the question will ultimately be, when will the courts say, all right, that's it? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=543.6s)]
*  Don't facilitate, I mean, don't use different kinds of language. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=547.9000000000001s)]
*  Simply say, bring him back and buy a date certain, or bring other people back by a date certain. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=550.7s)]
*  And then the question will be, will the administration follow that court order? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=556.3s)]
*  Do you think they've been using these SAT words, you know, effectuate his return because [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=560.0999999999999s)]
*  they don't want the fight? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=564.8s)]
*  They're hoping that the Trump folks will just do what the underlying kind of ruling is, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=566.0s)]
*  which is like, we want you to bring him back, but they don't want to be so clear because [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  they don't want to watch Donald Trump say, no, we're not doing it to a very clear, direct order. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=574.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think the court was giving the administration some, you know, there's some play in the joints [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=579.8s)]
*  there to try to say, all right, we're telling you to facilitate his return, essentially [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=584.6s)]
*  to me, Matt, well, you got to bring him back, but without, you know, saying a specific time [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=588.6s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=592.1s)]
*  But I think as this case winds its way back to the Supreme Court, and especially after [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=593.1s)]
*  that opinion by Judge Wilkinson of the Fourth Circuit that was so strong, I think the court [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=596.6s)]
*  is now going to have to decide. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=601.6s)]
*  I mean, you can't use language that has play in the joints. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=602.8s)]
*  You're going to have to tell this administration, all right, due process, rule of law says this [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=606.1s)]
*  man has to be brought back. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=610.9s)]
*  Do it by a date certain. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=612.7s)]
*  And then the question will be, will they in fact comply with that order? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=614.3000000000001s)]
*  Play in the joints to me sounds like stiff in the spine. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj8J04sMo8&t=618.5s)]
