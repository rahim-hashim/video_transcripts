# ‘What are we doing here?’: Nicolle Wallace reacts to Trump pardoning Todd and Julie Chrisley
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA)
*  It's a terrible thing, but it's a great thing because your parents are going to be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=0.0s)]
*  Free and clean and I hope we can do it by tomorrow give them [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=4.96s)]
*  I don't know them but give them my regards [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  they were given a pretty harsh treatment based on what I'm hearing just congratulate your parents and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  I hear they're terrific people that should not have happened [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=16.56s)]
*  They're terrific criminals what I mean what what what what are we doing here Harry Lippman [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=22.56s)]
*  Look, it's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=30.04s)]
*  deeply repugnant the the the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=31.56s)]
*  Power that he has may be broad but it's supposed to be in support of social values of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=35.08s)]
*  Mercy and forgiveness for people who admit the crimes they do and then make a better life [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=41.56s)]
*  It's exactly not what this is supposed to be and the wall check case. I think is a crime [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  It's just that the Supreme Court has ruled. He can't be [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=53.92s)]
*  Prosecuted but it sure looks like not just extortion but a flat-out bribe. We know what we're doing [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  We're have we're completely this supposed to be part in parcel of the criminal justice system instead [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=63.32s)]
*  He's using it as an override for the most crass most [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=69.12s)]
*  Political least sort of public spirited reasons there are do you and by the way the other five we just heard about on TV [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=73.52s)]
*  I don't know anything about them either like Liz [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=80.32s)]
*  But I can tell you what presidential candidate they supported and that really should always be irrelevant to a part in application [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=81.88s)]
*  Just a very quick broad point that I want to make is this is all about norms [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=88.92s)]
*  We were talking about this in the first term with Sheriff Joe and others [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  He really did transgress norms and they seem kind of like second level [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=96.92s)]
*  But this really goes to show as with everything else in the DOJ if you just completely demolish norms [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=101.5s)]
*  Whether or not there's a crime there it deeply injures the rule of law and the constitutional justice system [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=108.48s)]
*  And that's what's happening here with pardons [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=114.88s)]
*  Alex we've been circling around this issue of breaking through and stories [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=118.08s)]
*  I mean if there's a pardon story that might break through I want to bring this one up [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=121.94s)]
*  Donald Trump pardons a man named Jonathan Braun in the final days of his first term [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=127.32s)]
*  This is reporting about what he's gone on to do a convicted New York drug dealer [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  Whose 10-year federal prison sentence was commuted by Donald Trump was back in custody after he was accused of several crimes [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=138.28s)]
*  including assaulting a toddler [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=145.72s)]
*  Jonathan Braun was charged in April of violating the terms of his supervised release and ordered detained in Brooklyn Federal Court [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  According to the US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York's office [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  Now [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=158.96s)]
*  This is a longer lifespan of a pardon [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  This was the first term pardon, but this is what this pardoned individual went on to do again [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=164.4s)]
*  I want to quote it accurately quote assaulting a toddler. I [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  Think to Harry's point about how norm-shattering [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=175.24s)]
*  This is we can't lose sight of the ethics behind the pardon right and and in fact criminal justice reform more broadly, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  At one point was a bipartisan issue [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=184.84s)]
*  Are we overly punishing people should we rethink the way we incarcerate people and that is such a worthy? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=186.84s)]
*  Conversation to have and this is just utterly bastardized that entire conversation that you're letting out people who are obviously guilty [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  Who have done bad things and in the case of this individual in particular and I would I would bet in some others as well [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  These are not good people that have shown any penance any sort of contrition have not [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=207.0s)]
*  Rehabilitated themselves in the course of their incarceration and should not be let back out into society and all be forgiven, you know, and I think [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=212.48s)]
*  Trump has done so much bad in such a short time [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=222.44s)]
*  but when you think about the way in which something that is an expression of social benevolence of political benevolence of the state saying [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=225.64s)]
*  Perhaps we made a mistake and tainting that forevermore. We lose something that has been [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=233.32s)]
*  Good like a moral sort of part of the moral foundation of the presidency and of our federal government is its ability to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=239.72s)]
*  to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=247.48s)]
*  Rethink decisions right and to say we're not always right and the ability to admit, you know [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=248.76s)]
*  Overcompensation or a great, you know [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=255.96s)]
*  Stride and overreach is is what makes us good, right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=258.08s)]
*  Right, right and when you shatter that in the way that he has you lose that goodness and I don't mean to be heavy-handed [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=261.26s)]
*  But I do think it's part of the moral erosion [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=267.88s)]
*  That is the sort of at the root of all of these decisions that that Trump is making on his own behalf [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JNxJs2HRLA&t=270.8s)]
