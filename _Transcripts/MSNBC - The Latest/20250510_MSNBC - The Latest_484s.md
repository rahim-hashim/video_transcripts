# Rep. Horsford slams Trump admin. ‘authoritarian tactics’ in Newark mayor’s arrest
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY)
*  Let's bring in Democratic representative from Nevada, Stephen Horsford. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=0.0s)]
*  He sits on the House Ways and Means Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=4.24s)]
*  He's also chairman emeritus of the Congressional Black Caucus. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=6.12s)]
*  Congressman, I want to start with what we were just talking about, this arrest of New [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=9.48s)]
*  York's Mayor Ross Baraka. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=13.16s)]
*  He was taken into custody, the administration is saying, for attempting to enter an ICE [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=14.68s)]
*  detention center. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=19.0s)]
*  What is your reaction and what message does this arrest send to other lawmakers? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=20.36s)]
*  Well, thank you, Christina, for having me on. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=26.4s)]
*  And look, two things are true about the detainment of Mayor Baraka. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  And one is that the Trump administration continues to implement policies that are chaotic. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=36.96s)]
*  And number two, elected officials, on behalf of the constituents they represent, have every [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=45.68s)]
*  right to hold this administration accountable. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=52.0s)]
*  Mayor Baraka was there with several members of the Congressional Black Caucus who represent [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  that area. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  They were there doing their duty on behalf of their constituents, providing oversight. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  And the fact that the mayor was joining them, he represents that city and had already raised [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=67.48s)]
*  major concerns about the lack of building permits over this for-profit detention facility. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=74.72s)]
*  And so I think that there needs to be more accountability of this administration and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=82.52s)]
*  elected officials in Congress or the local officials, in this case Mayor Baraka, have [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=88.48s)]
*  every right to act on behalf of their constituents. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=94.72s)]
*  And this is not the only place we're seeing this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  There are several closed or defunct former prisons around the country that the administration [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=101.04s)]
*  is trying to reopen to turn into detention facilities. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  But a lot of them, as the mayor was alleging, don't have the correct permitting, haven't [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  gotten the permission of the local governments. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=113.48s)]
*  Could these local governments provide a backstop to some of these administration policies? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  Well, I know that Donald Trump and his administration don't believe it, but we are under a rule [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  of law. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=128.56s)]
*  They may have authoritarian tactics, but there are roles to play at the local and state level [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=129.79999999999998s)]
*  when it comes to the operation of any facilities, detention or otherwise. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=138.32s)]
*  I have a local facility like this in the rural part of my district. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  I have conducted oversight tours of that facility in the past, and I plan to do it again. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  And I would commend to this administration that I have every right to do that, as do [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=159.32s)]
*  my colleagues who joined with Mayor Baraka the other day, because it's our constitutional [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=165.64s)]
*  duty under the Article 1 Constitution and as members of Congress. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=172.68s)]
*  I also want to ask you about this effort House Democrats are making, kind of a long shot [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=179.32s)]
*  effort on the Hill to try to stop these drastic cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits as part [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=184.2s)]
*  of this GOP mega bill. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=188.6s)]
*  All right, we're going to dig into some parliamentary procedure here, so stick with me. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=189.88s)]
*  Maybe you can help explain it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=193.44s)]
*  But they've put forward a discharge petition, which with enough signatures would force a [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=194.76s)]
*  floor vote on the bill and prevent the House from making cuts to these key services. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=199.56s)]
*  Can you tell us more about this Democratic strategy here, and do you think it's going [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=204.68s)]
*  to work? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=208.32s)]
*  Well, Leader Jeffries and House Democrats are working every angle possible to prevent [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=209.32s)]
*  some of the most devastating cuts that congressional Republicans and Donald Trump are trying to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=217.6s)]
*  enact on the American people. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=225.4s)]
*  Republicans have said that they don't want to cut Medicaid or take away nutrition programs [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=228.64s)]
*  for children and seniors. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=234.64s)]
*  This is their opportunity to join with Democrats to tell their leadership, no cuts, hands off [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=237.32s)]
*  Medicaid, hands off nutrition assistance, hands off veterans care, and to make sure [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  that these areas are not included in the budget reconciliation. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  Now, sadly, Christina, this week we also have markups that are scheduled in the three major [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=256.56s)]
*  committees, Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Agriculture. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=263.48s)]
*  And those committees will be taking action on the various provisions of the Screw America [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=268.2s)]
*  Bill. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm concerned that they're going to take these actions in the dead of the night. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  They're going to attempt to cause the largest cut to Medicaid, which will affect everyone's [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=279.16s)]
*  health care, and to take away nutrition assistance for children and seniors to do what? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=286.44s)]
*  To give tax breaks to Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and billionaires like them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=293.36s)]
*  We are going to work hard to make sure that that doesn't happen. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  I was going to say, so if you think that's going to happen in the middle of the night, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=302.88s)]
*  one of the criticisms people have given towards Democrats is do more, do enough. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=305.36s)]
*  So if you think they're going to do this, what do you do? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=310.2s)]
*  Do you camp out in the halls in the middle of the night? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=312.0s)]
*  Do you keep an eye? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=313.8s)]
*  Do you get on the committees? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=314.8s)]
*  What can you do? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=315.8s)]
*  Well, as a member of the Ways and Means Committee, led by ranking member Neal, House Democrats [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=316.8s)]
*  are coming in ready and prepared. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=322.92s)]
*  Not only are we going to fight back against the permanent tax cuts for billionaires, but [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=325.28s)]
*  we have proposals to give permanent tax breaks to moms and dads to actually address the housing [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=330.92s)]
*  affordability crisis in our country, to enact policies that actually help working class [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  families and the middle class, and to not do that on the backs of Americans by causing [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=343.92s)]
*  these tax taxes, which are, excuse me, these tariffs, which are taxes to be enacted on [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=351.32s)]
*  the American people. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=357.76s)]
*  We have a comprehensive approach, and it's led by Leader Jeffries and the ranking members [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=359.28s)]
*  of those committees. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=364.64s)]
*  I also want to ask you, since you represent Las Vegas, a big service industry town, one [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=365.64s)]
*  of Trump's most repeated campaign promise was no tax on tips. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=371.11999999999995s)]
*  It's part of this quote, big, beautiful bill, as they've called it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=374.88s)]
*  You just called it something else. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  I can't repeat. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=379.08s)]
*  But, you know, the Economic Policy Institute argues that this would actually hurt more [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=380.08s)]
*  workers than it would help. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=384.08s)]
*  What is your take on this? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=385.88s)]
*  Do you support eliminating tax on tips or do you support leaving it as is? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=386.88s)]
*  So I have introduced legislation based on the input of the workers in Las Vegas and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=392.32s)]
*  across the country. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=399.28s)]
*  My bill, the tips act, not only eliminates the tax on tips because a tip is a gift, it [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=400.84s)]
*  is not a guarantee. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=408.32s)]
*  in the country, people are getting paid as little as $2.13 an hour. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=411.18s)]
*  And so my bill does two things. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=417.42s)]
*  One, it lifts the wage of tipped workers to at least the federal minimum wage or higher, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=419.22s)]
*  and it ensures that there are safeguards so that if the no tax on tips policy is implemented, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=426.9s)]
*  workers continue to pay in for their Social Security, that it's capped at a certain amount [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=435.34s)]
*  so that it can't be abused. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=441.38s)]
*  And lastly, that hedge funds aren't able to call this program a gift and no longer pay [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=444.5s)]
*  tax on it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=455.26s)]
*  So those are important safeguards that my bill includes. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=456.26s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=459.26s)]
*  Congressman Stephen Horsford, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=460.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHiChW1_JDY&t=464.34s)]
