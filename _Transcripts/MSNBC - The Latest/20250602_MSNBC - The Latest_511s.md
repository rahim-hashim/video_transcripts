# 'Every single hallmark of being a hate crime': Colorado AG speaks out on Boulder attack
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE)
*  And now back to our breaking news coverage of that gruesome attack in Boulder, Colorado. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=0.0s)]
*  Local police have just released the suspect's mugshot. He allegedly used incendiary weapons [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=4.64s)]
*  to attack peaceful demonstrators who were marching on behalf of the Israeli hostages in Gaza. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=9.92s)]
*  Boulder police say none of the eight victims have died. Colorado Attorney General Philip Weiser is [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  joining us now. Attorney General, we appreciate you joining us. Our hearts go out to the entire [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=20.96s)]
*  Colorado community, especially those in Boulder and the Jewish community in your state. What is [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=26.08s)]
*  the status of this investigation right now, and can you provide some clarity on the potential charges [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=32.0s)]
*  here? Hon, this is a complex case, obviously, with eight people who currently have been injured, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=36.48s)]
*  one who's in critical condition. The situation could involve both federal and state charges, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  and that's something that the Department of Justice and the Boulder District Attorney Michael [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=51.76s)]
*  Dougherty are going to need to work out. Our Boulder DA's office has been through a very [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=55.28s)]
*  complex and high-profile prosecution involving a shooting, mass shooting, at a King's Supers here [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=60.72s)]
*  in Boulder. That is not too far from where this attack happened. This has every single harm rock [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  of being a hate crime. How that will get held up, either in the federal or the state cases, remains [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=73.44s)]
*  to be seen. There are enhanced penalties, not just for hate crimes, but for attacking older [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=80.48s)]
*  Coloradans. Most of the individuals were older. This was a peaceful march done every single week [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=85.68s)]
*  by the Jewish community, calling out the injustices of the hostages, and they were attacked because of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=91.2s)]
*  who they are, because they're Jews, and on the eve of a Jewish holiday. It is heart-wrenching for all [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=97.04s)]
*  of us in Colorado, obviously very close to home for you as well, Anna. Yeah, I keep on coming back [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=102.4s)]
*  to just having been so many times on Pearl Street Mall and just never ever envisioning something so [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=108.72s)]
*  horrific happening there, and I'm sure anybody could say the same in their own hometowns when [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=115.92s)]
*  an attack or tragedy happens. But we just reported out that Boulder police have said no victims have [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=121.44s)]
*  died, thankfully. Although we do know that there have been charges prepared should that happen, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=127.92s)]
*  murder charges. Can you tell us sort of the state of some of these victims, just how bad of a shape [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=133.76s)]
*  they might be in? It varies. It has been acknowledged by many that one victim who's in critical condition [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  is getting treatment now, and our prayers are with the families of everyone who's there who's affected. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=151.04s)]
*  Some, the burns were more mild, and obviously in between, depending on how people were affected, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=157.04s)]
*  the scenes are gruesome as people who've seen these pictures know. This is a very cruel, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=163.68s)]
*  obviously premeditated attack with the goal of harming, even killing people. It is repulsive. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=169.36s)]
*  It's got to be condemned. There's no possible justification for this. We know antisemitism is [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=176.24s)]
*  on the rise. Even before October 7th, hate crimes against Jews were far more against hate crimes [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  against any other religious community. America is a nation where there's a promise of no bigotry. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=189.04s)]
*  George Washington, famous, he wrote a letter to a Rhode Island synagogue quoting from the book of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=194.48s)]
*  Micah, saying this is a land where everyone should sit safely under their own vine and fig tree. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=198.72s)]
*  That was breach, that promise. It's one that we're going to have to think hard about how we [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  protect religious communities, including Jews. How do we make sure to honor a commitment that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=209.04s)]
*  in America, we don't allow violence. We resolve our differences through the democratic process. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=214.0s)]
*  Those details are going to be forthcoming as we learn more. Obviously now we've [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=232.0s)]
*  know more some specifics, but there's more we're going to learn. Any such situation like this, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=237.44s)]
*  we've got to ask what can we learn? What can we do differently? One important point I would say is [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  if you hear someone talking about such a possible attack, we have to take it seriously. We have to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=247.6s)]
*  take the commitment to protect vulnerable communities seriously. There's homeland security [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=254.0s)]
*  money, money that's actually now being threatened of being taken away from Colorado. We're in court [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=258.4s)]
*  to protect it so that our synagogues, our mosques, other places of worship can be protected from [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=262.72s)]
*  attacks. This sort of attack is one that we need to figure out how we do all we can to prevent. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=268.08s)]
*  We can't allow people to be terrorized. We can't allow fear to win. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=274.32s)]
*  This happened in a busy pedestrian area near the courthouse there in Boulder. It was a group that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=277.52s)]
*  holds this peaceful hostage demonstration weekly, as you described. What was the security presence [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=283.28s)]
*  like? Should there have been more precautions? We're going to have to think hard about what [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=290.0s)]
*  we need to keep doing, how we keep people safe. We can't stop peaceful marches because we're [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=295.52s)]
*  afraid. We can't have religious communities afraid to say who they are. I'm proud of my [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=300.64s)]
*  Jewish heritage. The people who are there, some friends of mine were there. They feel the same [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=306.08s)]
*  way, and we need to protect that. Boulder law enforcement is taking this crime very seriously. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=310.32s)]
*  We need to take seriously all we can do for security. This Pearl Street Mall, as you've [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=317.2s)]
*  talked about, this is an open area that people go, and we need to preserve that. We need to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=321.84s)]
*  preserve our commitment to keeping everyone safe. That's something that I, as attorney general, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=327.84s)]
*  that's something that Boulder DA, Boulder law enforcement are committed to. Any lessons we [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=333.11999999999995s)]
*  can learn from this, we're going to take those and we're going to do all we can to make sure [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=336.88s)]
*  something like this never happens again. I know this is personal for you, and you [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=340.23999999999995s)]
*  talked about the rising numbers of hate crimes or antisemitic crimes, or if this could be a [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=345.04s)]
*  terrorist crime in the U.S. We do know, according to FBI statistics, that these types of crimes [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  have risen for four straight years, hitting a new modern high. Your grandparents survived the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  Holocaust. Your mother was born in a concentration camp. What do you make of this recent rise in [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=367.12s)]
*  antisemitism in America? It's hard to take. My grandmother, my grandfather, and my mom came here [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=372.88s)]
*  believing the promise I mentioned that George Washington said. This is a land where bigotry [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=381.52s)]
*  has no sanction. America is a land for freedom for everyone, for opportunity for everyone, no matter [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=385.68s)]
*  who you are, no matter who you worship, whether you worship, who you love. I take those values very, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=391.44s)]
*  very seriously. That's what's propelled me into public service my whole life. That is something [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=397.28s)]
*  that I hold onto. There was a Holocaust survivor there in this march who was attacked. We have to [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=402.24s)]
*  look evil, look the outrageous acts in the eye, and say never again. That's what we say after [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=410.8s)]
*  the Holocaust, never again. October 7th is another horrendous date where we saw Hamas trying to just [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=417.44s)]
*  kill as many Jews, rape as many Jews as possible. We cannot allow such actions to be normalized, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=423.6s)]
*  to become something that we're remotely accepting. And this is something that all of us [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=431.28s)]
*  as Americans, all of us as people of conscience have to hold onto. It is too easy for people to [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=437.67999999999995s)]
*  sometimes look away or not bear witness to the evil and to the atrocities like this. I will say I'm [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  very heartened by how much condemnation we've been hearing from all quarters, how much support for [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=451.35999999999996s)]
*  the Jewish community. That's what we need in America. We all stand together and we treat hate [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=456.56s)]
*  crimes like this one against hate against all groups. We've seen actions against the LGBTQ [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=461.52s)]
*  community in Colorado. We've seen actions against the black community. These sorts of hate crimes [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=466.72s)]
*  have to be condemned in the strongest terms. We have to hold these perpetrators accountable [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  and have to make clear what type of America we believe in. Colorado Attorney General Philip Wiser, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=476.0s)]
*  thank you for being with us. We really appreciate your time, especially as you're in the heat of [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=481.28s)]
*  an ongoing crisis and emergency there in the state. Thank you. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy0WOZNm2nE&t=486.56s)]
