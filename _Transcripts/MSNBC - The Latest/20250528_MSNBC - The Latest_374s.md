# ‘Moment of confusion and anxiety’: Harvard student speaks out on Trump targeting student visas
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0)
*  I want to bring in the staff writer at the Harvard Crimson, Dhruv Patel, also here with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=0.0s)]
*  us, independent political strategist and co-founder of the Lincoln Project, Reid Galen. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=4.84s)]
*  So Dhruv, you just heard some of your classmates say the administration is treating your community [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=9.0s)]
*  like pawns, or as your colleagues at the Crimson put it, quote, they are talking about the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=13.6s)]
*  human cost of playing politics. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=19.3s)]
*  What's it like on campus right now? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  What are the conversations? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=23.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=25.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=26.44s)]
*  Look, I think it's really a moment of confusion and anxiety for many international students [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=27.44s)]
*  on campus. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=30.92s)]
*  When we saw the Department of Homeland Security's directive come in last Thursday, the immediate [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=31.92s)]
*  question for many international students was what does this actually mean for me? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=36.04s)]
*  Especially for graduating students who are set to walk across the stage at Harvard's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=40.32s)]
*  commencement ceremony tomorrow, it was a question of am I going to be able to actually obtain [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=43.88s)]
*  my diploma next week? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=48.06s)]
*  What we see among students is really a sense of frustration that has resulted in Zoom calls [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  like we just saw among alumni. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=54.68s)]
*  That is the same case when we see protests being held on campus. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=56.88s)]
*  And I think the messaging here is really important because we see that these protests that are [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=59.68s)]
*  being held just days before commencement, they're inviting faculty, they're inviting [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=63.64s)]
*  friends and they're inviting families as well. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=68.2s)]
*  And so we're seeing record turnout at these protests and we're going to continue to see [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=70.4s)]
*  the standoff develop. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=73.68s)]
*  You know, for so long, Dhruv, Harvard has been the place in the world for the best and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=75.44s)]
*  brightest. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=79.56s)]
*  They've aspired to go to Harvard. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=80.56s)]
*  How real is the fear that either they will not be allowed to go to Harvard or with all [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=83.24s)]
*  the uncertainty, they'll just say it's not worth it? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  Look, I think what's important to note here is that when we saw the directive come in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=92.8s)]
*  last Thursday, the question really was what does this mean for me? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=96.96s)]
*  That on Friday, Harvard was granted a temporary restraining order and a federal judge blocked [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=99.96s)]
*  the DHS from enforcing that directive. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=104.56s)]
*  But like we saw, there's a new directive now to place a pause in student visa interviews [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  and there's still an open question of what's to come in the pipeline. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  And so really for international students, it's a mix of, you know, good news and then bad [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  news as well. And for them, it's really being able to confront the moment and being able to, say, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=118.36s)]
*  update on the information as the standoff continues to develop both in the political end, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  but also the legal system. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=127.6s)]
*  Rhee, the amount of resources, time, energy needed for the State Department, first of all, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=129.4s)]
*  to scrub all these folks' social media to determine who is what the administration deems [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=134.4s)]
*  as not acceptable. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=139.6s)]
*  Is this the legitimate waiting out of potential troublemakers or just simply trying to control [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=141.76s)]
*  what people say? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  I think it's about punishing what people say and holding them in the Trump administration's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=151.04s)]
*  mind to account for any criticism of the president himself or the administration or any of their [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=156.88s)]
*  policies. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=161.4s)]
*  And I think this is one thing that we really should understand, is that this is exactly the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  fight they want. One, but two, remember that in a power play, the Trump administration [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=167.24s)]
*  holds all the actual power. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=173.08s)]
*  They can prevent these kids from coming. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=175.16s)]
*  They can kick these kids out. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  They can determine who can and can't enter the country for any reason. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=178.96s)]
*  And so I think that's one thing we have to understand. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=183.12s)]
*  I think the other part, too, is that when we talk about Harvard and you hear if it's going to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  happen to us, it'll happen to you next. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  I think that we who believe in free expression, in the idea of a solid education for all Americans [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=192.2s)]
*  or all humans, we have to expand the argument. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=199.24s)]
*  Right. It's not just about Harvard. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=202.12s)]
*  If we leave it about Harvard, that makes it too elite an argument. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  This is about taking on education as we know it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=208.04s)]
*  It's about taking on what we know as a liberal democracy and the philosophy of free thought and free [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=211.16s)]
*  expression. But we have to make that palatable not only to people who stayed home, but also to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=216.68s)]
*  a lot of the people who support Donald Trump who are not the people that you might think of, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=222.0s)]
*  but a lot of upper middle class people in suburbs who also didn't go to Harvard who maybe don't [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=226.6s)]
*  really like it. And lastly, making sure that people understand that, OK, yes, Harvard gets a lot of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=232.28s)]
*  funding. But what is the downstream benefit of that? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=237.56s)]
*  And I think that that's a story that Harvard needs to tell, too, not just to you and me, Chris, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=240.08s)]
*  but to everybody around the country. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=245.08s)]
*  You know, to that point, Reid, I want to play the argument from the White House press secretary [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=247.08s)]
*  about taking funding from Harvard. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=251.36s)]
*  And the president is more interested in giving that taxpayer money to trade schools and programs [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=255.36s)]
*  in state schools where they are promoting American values, but most importantly, educating the next [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=261.68s)]
*  generation based on skills that we need in our economy and our society, apprenticeships, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=267.88s)]
*  electricians, plumbers. We need more of those in our country and less LGBTQ graduate majors [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=274.12s)]
*  from Harvard University. And that's what this administration's position is. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=280.96s)]
*  Readable Americans agree with that? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  I think some will. Look, I think that it's one of those where we have spent, Chris, the last 50 or 60 [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=289.08s)]
*  years telling everybody that they have to get a higher education and frankly, putting down those [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=295.24s)]
*  who either are unwilling or incapable of getting into college for whatever various reasons. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=300.56s)]
*  And so I think that we do need blue collar people. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=305.47999999999996s)]
*  But also remember that we already have 500,000 open manufacturing jobs that we can't fill with the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=307.88s)]
*  people we have. And so this is just one more lowest common denominator. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=314.68s)]
*  I mean, look, she's a kook. She's going to say whatever it is she needs to say, but they're very good at this. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=318.56s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump on any given day may sound like a buffoon and is a buffoon, but we should never, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=322.76s)]
*  ever deny that the people around him are very savvy about the arguments they're making, to whom they're [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=327.52s)]
*  making and how they're making them so that they spread across the broadest swath of Americans who can try and do [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  that reasonable person test. They'll go, well, yeah, we probably should give more money to trade schools. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=339.72s)]
*  And that's why you have to argue about this upfront, hard every time. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=344.20000000000005s)]
*  Do not sit back and say, well, maybe this time we'll just pass because he's done it before. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLluQf2bt0&t=349.16s)]
