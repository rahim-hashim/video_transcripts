# LA superintendent responds to DHS officials attempting to enter two elementary schools
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0)
*  Eighteen past hour last week DHS officials attempted to enter two public Los Angeles [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=0.0s)]
*  Elementary schools asking to speak to several children. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=5.22s)]
*  The department said they were conducting wellness checks on the children. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=8.34s)]
*  School officials turned them away, however. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=12.3s)]
*  Joining us now, Alberto Carvalho, superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=15.14s)]
*  and a personal friend of mine whom I very much admire. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=19.78s)]
*  Alberto, thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=22.94s)]
*  So what exactly happened in these schools? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=26.46s)]
*  Good morning, Jose. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=30.36s)]
*  Thank you so much for the opportunity. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=31.36s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=32.36s)]
*  Look, last week we had about four to five agents showing up at two elementary schools [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=33.36s)]
*  two hours apart. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=39.8s)]
*  We believe it was the exact same team asking for access to students ranging in grade from [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=40.84s)]
*  first through sixth grade. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=47.82s)]
*  Obviously, we trained our principals, our support staff in denying access to students [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=50.5s)]
*  without a judicial warrant, you know, a criminal warrant signed by a judge. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=56.64s)]
*  I would find it very difficult to believe that a first grader or a second grader would [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=62.54s)]
*  have committed some type of crime that would require some interaction with a federal agency. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=66.53999999999999s)]
*  So the principals asked for identification from these individuals. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=72.36s)]
*  They did produce IDs. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=76.18s)]
*  When the principals attempted to write information from their IDs, they quickly pocketed those [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=78.62s)]
*  IDs and conveyed to the principals that that was not allowed. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=84.06s)]
*  And then they actually conveyed to the principals that they wanted to meet with the students [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=87.92s)]
*  and they had parental permission from these students' parents to have access to them, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=92.4s)]
*  which is counterintuitive since they did declare in a statement that was produced by the Department [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=98.48s)]
*  of Homeland Security after this incident that their reason for being at the schools [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=105.8s)]
*  was because these students were unaccompanied minors. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=111.02s)]
*  By the way, we made contact with the guardians of these children. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=114.42s)]
*  In no instance, at no point was that access granted to these federal agents. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=119.0s)]
*  So I'd like to want to be very clear, Superintendent, what the Department of Homeland Security [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=126.06s)]
*  actually said after this, and I'm just going to quote it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=129.82s)]
*  It says, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=132.86s)]
*  Superintendent, what's your response to that? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=143.12s)]
*  And also, there is a concern for maybe up to hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  minors who cross the border and who many times are in conditions that should be checked on, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  found, and make sure they're okay. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=162.26000000000002s)]
*  I absolutely agree. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  There should be well-deserved checks, but I think we can all agree that one of the safest [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=167.08s)]
*  places in America for children are public schools under the protection of teachers, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=170.52s)]
*  of principals, of superintendents. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  Secondly, let's be clear about one thing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  This is what the agents said when they went to the schools, that they were not ICE, they [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=181.74s)]
*  were with the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=185.94s)]
*  They did not state the reason as to why they want access to the students. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=188.42s)]
*  The statement that was released after the fact does convey that message. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=192.28s)]
*  However, it seems to be somewhat untrue because they did declare that they had spoken with [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=197.2s)]
*  the parents of these children, which would render them something less than unaccompanied [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=204.16s)]
*  than the parents had granted them access. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=208.76s)]
*  This is blatantly untrue. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=211.32s)]
*  I don't want to make an additional point. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=212.72s)]
*  Look, we are compelled from a legal perspective to protect these kids based on FERPA, which [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=216.18s)]
*  is the Federal Education Rights Privacy Law. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=222.5s)]
*  We are compelled to protect children from access to anyone on the basis of privacy and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=227.26s)]
*  confidentiality. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=232.3s)]
*  Secondly, under the Constitution of the United States of America, we are obliged to provide [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=233.3s)]
*  a free public education to every single student regardless of immigration status. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=241.04s)]
*  And then lastly, there is something called in local parentas, which every single educator [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=245.44s)]
*  knows. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=250.48s)]
*  In the absence of a parent, I as an educator, as a superintendent, as a principal, as a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=251.48s)]
*  teacher, need to act in a protective matter as if I were that child's parent. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=256.2s)]
*  So we do not grant access to anyone to have access to our children on the basis of those [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=262.64s)]
*  three very important legal parameters, no matter what. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHk1kusXQ0&t=268.96s)]
