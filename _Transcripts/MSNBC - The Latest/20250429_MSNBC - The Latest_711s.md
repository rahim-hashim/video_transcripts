# 'He's already blinked': Voters lose confidence in Trump's handling of the economy
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU)
*  A failing grade, 100 days into the second Trump administration, nearly half of all Americans, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=0.0s)]
*  45 percent to be exact, believe that Donald Trump deserves an F for the way he has handled [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  the presidency. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=12.08s)]
*  That is according to new poll from NPR, PBS News and Marist. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=13.08s)]
*  And if you look under the hood, the numbers, they are even worse for Donald Trump. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=17.76s)]
*  Just under half of all independents give the president an F. And just 54 percent of his [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=22.12s)]
*  own political base, Republican voters, would give him an A grade. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=27.54s)]
*  NPR reports that, quote, it's driven by views of how he's handling the economy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=31.619999999999997s)]
*  The first 100 days of Trump 2.0 have been defined by dramatic disruption. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=36.54s)]
*  And there has been a lot of it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=41.62s)]
*  The gutting of federal agencies, reorienting of the country's place in the world, a government [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=43.379999999999995s)]
*  at war with universities and law firms and Trump's political critics. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=47.66s)]
*  But the first 100 days has also seen the emergence of a political vulnerability that Donald Trump [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=52.42s)]
*  did not really have in the first Trump administration. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=57.620000000000005s)]
*  And Donald Trump, well, he has no one to blame for it but himself. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=61.14s)]
*  He started the trade war with China and with Canada and with Mexico and practically every [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=65.7s)]
*  country and island here on planet Earth. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=70.14s)]
*  According to the Yale Budget Lab, consumers face an effective tariff rate of 28 percent. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=73.38s)]
*  That is the highest since 1901. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=78.82000000000001s)]
*  The conservative-leaning Wall Street Journal now warns that the tariffs could be Trump's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=81.86s)]
*  undoing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=86.22s)]
*  The editorial board writes that, quote, presidential second terms are rarely successful. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=87.22s)]
*  And on the evidence of his first 100 days, Donald Trump's won't be different. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=92.3s)]
*  The president needs a major reset if he wants to rescue his final years from the economic [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=97.06s)]
*  and foreign policy shocks he has unleashed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=101.78s)]
*  Mr. Trump was elected to control inflation and raise real incomes, but tariffs do the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=104.82s)]
*  opposite. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=110.42s)]
*  It's a mistake to think the tariff damage is only domestic. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=111.42s)]
*  The willy-nilly assault on friends and foes has shaken global confidence in U.S. reliability. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=114.9s)]
*  Voters re-elected Mr. Trump in part because they remembered fondly his first-term economy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=120.98s)]
*  This term, he is indulging his trade and foreign policy obsessions. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=126.14s)]
*  And the early results are negative. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=130.34s)]
*  He'll fail unless he heeds the warnings. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=132.54s)]
*  Team Trump does not appear to be heeding the warnings, at least not today. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=135.78s)]
*  The administration began its 100th day attacking Amazon over reporting by Punchbowl News that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  it was going to show how much Trump's tariffs would be adding to the price of every product. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=144.74s)]
*  Here's what White House Press Secretary Carolyn Levitt had to say about that reporting. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=150.10000000000002s)]
*  I will take this, since I just got off the phone with the president about Amazon's announcement. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=154.62s)]
*  This is a hostile and political act by Amazon. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=161.14000000000001s)]
*  A hostile and political act showing the import duties at checkout would have made it crystal [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=166.58s)]
*  clear exactly who was paying Trump's tariffs. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=171.9s)]
*  That would be you, me, the American consumer. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=174.78s)]
*  In response to the Trump administration's attacks, Amazon released a statement saying, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=177.74s)]
*  quote, the team that runs our ultra low-cost Amazon haul store considered the idea of listing [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=181.3s)]
*  import charges on certain products. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=186.34s)]
*  This was never approved and not going to happen. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=188.82s)]
*  A fight with Amazon, a multiple warning signs about tariffs revealing Donald Trump's political [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=191.46s)]
*  Achilles heel is where we start today. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=195.62s)]
*  Staff writer for The Atlantic and MSNBC political analyst Ashley Parker is here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=198.38s)]
*  Plus MSNBC columnist and author of the newsletter. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=203.06s)]
*  To the contrary, Charlie Sykes, an anchor and correspondent for Bloomberg News, David [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=205.82s)]
*  Gura in Ottawa, Canada covering their elections. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=210.28s)]
*  It is good to see you all, David. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  We're going to talk about what is happening, where you are in Ottawa in just a few minutes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=214.62s)]
*  But first, let's start with the unease over the economy, the cloud that's now looming [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=218.17999999999998s)]
*  over Donald Trump, our politics. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=221.82s)]
*  What is the prevailing Wall Street view on Trump's tariffs at this moment? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=224.82s)]
*  Well, Wall Street is still looking for some sense of certainty from this White House, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=230.5s)]
*  and it's gotten none over these last 100 days. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=235.7s)]
*  If you look at the tariffs policy in particular, there's been starts and stops, pauses. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=238.54s)]
*  All of this is adding to some unease about the direction of all of this, where it's headed. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=242.58s)]
*  And so we've seen obviously dramatic market moves here over the last few months. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=245.74s)]
*  Those have continued. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=249.7s)]
*  And I should say it's not a sign of a healthy market if the market shoots up by a thousand [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=250.7s)]
*  points, just as it's not if it goes down by a thousand points. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=253.54s)]
*  That's giving you an indication here that what Wall Street's looking for actually is [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=256.38s)]
*  some sort of concrete deal. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=259.98s)]
*  And there can be all kinds of happy talk about progress made on one deal or another or talks [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  that may or may not be taking place. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=265.82s)]
*  But until something is actually codified or signed, Wall Street is not going to be happy [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=267.18s)]
*  enough to have confidence in the direction of this economy, the direction of where the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=271.21999999999997s)]
*  White House is going here. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=275.18s)]
*  I think just looking back on these last 100 days, that is the overarching message on both [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=276.26s)]
*  Wall Street and Main Street. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=280.65999999999997s)]
*  A White House pursuing economic policies that aren't resonant with either constituency, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=281.98s)]
*  the president doing things that he hasn't fully explained, both to those high level [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=286.42s)]
*  investors and just regular folks wondering why he's doing what he's doing. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=289.62s)]
*  Alicia. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=292.54s)]
*  Actually, in light of that reality, which David laid out so clearly, you still have [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=293.54s)]
*  a president that was really doubling down on this idea of tariffs. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=297.78s)]
*  You spoke with him just yesterday and you report this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=300.86s)]
*  Trump pushed back on the notion popular among some Wall Street analysts that financial turmoil, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=303.98s)]
*  plummeting markets, the threat of a recession, a weakened dollar would cause him to roll [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=308.94s)]
*  back his tariff policies. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=312.98s)]
*  Quote, it always affects you a little bit, he said, but there's no red line, no certain [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=314.54s)]
*  number at which he would feel compelled to change course. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=319.5s)]
*  Why the commitment to something that he can see in the numbers is not resonating. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=322.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=329.42s)]
*  He told us that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=331.5s)]
*  And one thing that was interesting was the first time he actually did change his tariff [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=332.5s)]
*  policy, or at least do this 90 day pause, which we're in the middle of, was when the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=336.3s)]
*  bond markets went haywire. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=341.1s)]
*  So he told us, you know, there's not a number. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=343.46000000000004s)]
*  I don't really have a red line. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=346.98s)]
*  I can stomach a tremendous amount of pain. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=348.62s)]
*  That said, the first time we saw push come to shove, in this case, he did have a red [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=351.22s)]
*  line and it was the bond markets. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=355.1s)]
*  But as to why he would say this, another thing he told us when we were in the Oval Office [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=356.90000000000003s)]
*  with him last Thursday was he said, look, he just said, I believe this. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=360.54s)]
*  He said, I have believed this in my gut for 35 or 40 years. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=365.98s)]
*  This idea that America is getting ripped off, getting taken advantage of, that we're [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=370.22s)]
*  getting a bad deal. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=373.66s)]
*  And for a president who is not particularly ideological, this is one of his few core political [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=375.5s)]
*  policy beliefs. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=382.02000000000004s)]
*  And I think that helps explain why on the whole, broadly, he is so dug in on tariffs. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=383.02000000000004s)]
*  OK, so, Charlie, let's just go with that, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=388.82000000000005s)]
*  The president says this is something he believes. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=391.46000000000004s)]
*  He believes it in his core. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=393.66s)]
*  As we know, there's sort of a white paper that gave way to all of this about the potential [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=395.98s)]
*  for restructuring global markets, how that would require these tariffs. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=400.58000000000004s)]
*  The problem is, he hasn't actually stuck to the plan as it would need to be followed, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=404.54s)]
*  even in the theoretical, right? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=411.58000000000004s)]
*  It would have to have been targeted in terms of the countries they were going after. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  It would need to have had carrots and sticks that accompanied the tariffs. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  He would have needed to stay the course, not imposing tariffs, rolling them back, imposing [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=421.98s)]
*  them, rolling them back. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  The bad math we've seen out of his own administration, where they themselves could not tell us what [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=428.18s)]
*  the tariff rate on China was, he may have the belief. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=432.9s)]
*  He does not have the discipline to follow the plan necessary, even if you theoretically [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=437.62s)]
*  believe it could be effective. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=443.18s)]
*  Yeah, and that might be a problem. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=444.9s)]
*  This is, as Ashley points out, this is one of his consistent through lines. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=449.78s)]
*  He said a fetish about tariffs forever. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=453.21999999999997s)]
*  But also, this is a president who wants to project strength. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=455.7s)]
*  He wants to have people think that he is a master negotiator who never blinks. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=458.97999999999996s)]
*  But of course, he's already blinked, and he will probably blink again. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=464.26s)]
*  But what is interesting is the way in which he has cut himself loose, both from the economic [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=468.58s)]
*  experts and from all the Wall Street folks who had really talked themselves into thinking [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=473.97999999999996s)]
*  that he was just bluffing, that these were just negotiating ploys. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=478.91999999999996s)]
*  And now they're looking around going, none of this makes sense. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=483.08s)]
*  The math does not add up. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=486.11999999999995s)]
*  They contradict themselves on an almost daily basis. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=487.76s)]
*  And they have this massive uncertainty hanging over them. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  And they know that the worst is yet to come. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=493.84s)]
*  There's almost this tsunami heading toward the West Coast ports where they're saying, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=496.2s)]
*  look, these shipping containers are not coming from China or they're coming empty. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=501.64s)]
*  You have a longshoreman who are saying, look, please take the tariffs off because we're [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=506.35999999999996s)]
*  going to have this massive hit across the board. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=510.67999999999995s)]
*  Trucking companies are experiencing this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=515.9599999999999s)]
*  So the reality is that he's taken a hit in public opinion. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=517.4s)]
*  But the economic pain has not yet been felt, but it is coming. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=524.16s)]
*  What I also think is interesting is the way the public opinion has turned on all of this. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=528.8399999999999s)]
*  This was a big issue in the 2024 campaign, but a lot of voters shrugged it off because [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=534.0s)]
*  they did not take Trump seriously or literally. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=538.72s)]
*  And you get the sense that right now, a lot of voters, swing voters, are thinking, you [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=541.52s)]
*  know what, maybe he is serious about these things. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=546.16s)]
*  Maybe we ought to take him literally and seriously. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  And this poses a real danger to my job, my community, my business, and my 401k. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=551.92s)]
*  I mean, Ashley, to speak to Charlie's point about the fact that we have been warned that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  shipping containers are not fully packed, that Long Beach is not seeing the traffic [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=564.08s)]
*  that they normally see at the port, that you have the CEOs of companies like Target and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=569.76s)]
*  Walmart calling this president saying, Mr. President, two weeks, there may not be sufficient [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=575.12s)]
*  goods on the shelves. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=579.84s)]
*  Consumers are going to start coming to our store and they're not going to have some of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=581.12s)]
*  their basic needs met. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=584.0s)]
*  You then have the reporting from today about Trump calling Jeff Bezos saying that Amazon [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=586.0s)]
*  was considering showing the cost of tariffs on individual products. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=592.24s)]
*  Why is this reporting about Amazon generating so much reaction all the way to the presidential [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=595.76s)]
*  briefing room? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=601.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, again, Donald Trump's argument on tariffs is basically that tariffs are a purely good [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=604.7199999999999s)]
*  thing and there will not be—I mean, one thing that has been interesting is he has [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=611.1999999999999s)]
*  admitted in a way that he typically does not a few times, there may be a little bit of [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=614.96s)]
*  pain. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=620.48s)]
*  We need to take the long view, which is something—he's very impatient. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=621.84s)]
*  He's often focused on winning sort of the day, the minute, the news cycle, but he has [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=625.76s)]
*  shown a little willingness to say to Americans there might be a little pain for long-term [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=630.88s)]
*  gain. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=635.12s)]
*  That said, he's largely dismissed that and papered over it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=635.52s)]
*  And the idea of showing, for Amazon showing, for instance, that this thing that used to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=639.52s)]
*  cost X now costs Y, $10, $20, depending, higher, that is making voters, including many who [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=643.92s)]
*  voted for him, understand exactly the effects of tariffs and understand exactly that pain. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=655.36s)]
*  And it's pocketbook pain, and it's pocketbook pain that you can talk to Democrats and [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  Republicans that decided this past election. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=666.0s)]
*  That is why people chose, at their core, Donald Trump over Joe Biden, because they thought he [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=669.36s)]
*  would be better for the economy. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=674.24s)]
*  And so the economy, as it ever was, is always such a deep political issue that Donald Trump [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=676.08s)]
*  knows he does not want to be blamed for a bad economy and more viscerally than a bad economy, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=682.24s)]
*  sort of daily rising prices. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRAcJEO67TU&t=687.6s)]
