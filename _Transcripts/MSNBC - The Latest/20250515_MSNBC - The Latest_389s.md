# Justices struggled with ‘absurdity’ of Trump admin’s legal arguments: Washington AG
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU)
*  Joining us now, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, who brought one of the lawsuits [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=0.0s)]
*  that went before the Supreme Court today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=4.92s)]
*  That was just one of the interjections we heard from Justice Coney Barrett. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=7.58s)]
*  But was there anything you heard from her today, from Justice Kavanaugh in particular, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  that surprised you, gave you hope for your side? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=16.0s)]
*  Give me your analysis of what you heard today. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=18.76s)]
*  Well, sure. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=20.96s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=22.72s)]
*  I think we heard from justices of all stripes a lot of skepticism about the legal arguments [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=23.72s)]
*  that were being made by the Department of Justice today, not only on the more procedural [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=27.88s)]
*  arguments about the scope of nationwide injunctions, but many justices started to get to the heart [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=31.76s)]
*  of the issue about what it means to be an American and the really hundred plus years [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=36.6s)]
*  of precedent from the Supreme Court and Congress and others about reestablishing that if you're [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=41.28s)]
*  born on American soil, that you are in fact an American. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=45.96s)]
*  But many of the justices really struggled with the Department of Justice's arguments [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=49.6s)]
*  that this wouldn't apply universally. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=54.3s)]
*  And really, I think it started to unravel the absurdity of some of these legal arguments, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=57.2s)]
*  the idea that you would be born in my home state of Washington, but that you could cross [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=60.84s)]
*  across the border into Idaho and you would lose all the rights and privileges that comes [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=64.88s)]
*  with being an American. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=69.08s)]
*  I think a lot of justices really, really struggled with that idea. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=70.28s)]
*  The Solicitor General, who of course, for folks who don't know, argued on behalf of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=73.88s)]
*  the government, was grilled on the practicality of ending those nationwide injunctions. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=77.56s)]
*  And I want you to listen to that and we'll talk about it on the other side. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=83.08s)]
*  Your theory here is arguing that Article 3 and principles of equity both prohibit federal [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=86.64s)]
*  courts from issuing universal injunctions. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=95.04s)]
*  Do I have your argument correct? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=97.28s)]
*  We argue both of those. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=98.8s)]
*  You argue both of those? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=99.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=100.8s)]
*  If that's true, that means even the Supreme Court doesn't have that power. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=101.8s)]
*  The Supreme Court have the authority to issue binding precedent nationwide. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=105.8s)]
*  But we couldn't enforce it against universally, is your argument. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=108.88s)]
*  If there was a decision that violated the precedent of the court, then the affected [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=113.88s)]
*  plaintiffs could get a separate judgment. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=118.44s)]
*  And that means you're talking about the hundreds and thousands of people who weren't part of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  the judgment of the court. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=126.88s)]
*  They would all have to file individual actions? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=129.72s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=133.24s)]
*  Or a class action? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=136.04s)]
*  A class action would be... [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=137.04s)]
*  That makes no sense whatsoever. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=139.44s)]
*  That line of questioning actually, I'm sure you know, stretched beyond Justice Sotomayor. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=143.04s)]
*  You know, a lot of this was about, and we heard a little bit of it there, practicality [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=147.72s)]
*  arguments, but also how it should be applied. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=152.04s)]
*  Obviously, that is at the heart of it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=157.24s)]
*  What did you hear in that exchange and overall about the execution of how the courts can [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=159.5s)]
*  and should operate? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=166.84s)]
*  Well, Chris, a couple of additional things really stood out for me. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  And Justice Sotomayor really hit on the heart of the issue when she made an analogy to the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=172.56s)]
*  Department of Justice's arguments when it comes to gun rights in America and the Second [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=177.36s)]
*  Amendment rights that so many Americans enjoy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=182.44s)]
*  And she asked, you know, what if a president, President Biden or a prior president, had [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=185.24s)]
*  come in and said, no American has the right to possess a firearm anymore? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  And extending the arguments that were made today, that would mean that each individual [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=193.96s)]
*  gun owner or a class action of gun owners could only get relief individually if they [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=197.84s)]
*  were bound together. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  And the arguments that were made today were suggest that a court couldn't enjoin that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=204.12s)]
*  nationwide, which is really, really absurd. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=208.16000000000003s)]
*  And the other thing that I really want to key on is that the court pressed and pressed [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  and pressed about whether the Department of Justice would commit to following one of the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=214.12s)]
*  circuit courts weighing in on this issue. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  And they asked whether if the Second Circuit in the United States weighed in and said, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  in fact, birthright citizenship is your right, whether or not the Department of Justice [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=225.56s)]
*  would abide by that. And time and time again, they caveated their commitment to that by [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  saying, yes, generally what we would, but not unequivocally. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=233.68s)]
*  And the idea that the Department of Justice is saying in the highest court of the land [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=237.84s)]
*  that they wouldn't commit to following an order from one of our circuit courts in America [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  is really, really frankly shocking. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=246.24s)]
*  And it shows that the bounds by which the Department of Justice now is being stretched to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=247.96s)]
*  defend what we see time and time from the president of the United States is unlawfulness [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=251.92s)]
*  and lawlessness. And we can't abide by that as attorney generals representing our states. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  You sound, Mr. Attorney General, as though you have at least some level of confidence [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=260.0s)]
*  based on the arguments that you heard today. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=263.96s)]
*  But I wonder and I and I know a lot of the attorney attorneys general talk to each other, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=267.12s)]
*  particularly Democratic attorneys general. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=271.47999999999996s)]
*  And I wonder if you've had conversations about the impact and what you would do if the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=273.24s)]
*  ruling doesn't go your way. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=278.4s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, today's arguments were principally around the scope of nationwide [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=282.0s)]
*  injunctions and whether they should apply in this case. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=285.76s)]
*  And as the justices really parsed out today, that is a pretty bipartisan concern that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=288.0s)]
*  nationwide injunctions are being used too frequently. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=293.44s)]
*  And I can see the judges. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=296.16s)]
*  Justice is really struggling with that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=297.32s)]
*  And so I'm not sure that how they will come out on that issue. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=298.76s)]
*  But I am certain that when they get to the merits of this issue about birthright citizenship [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=302.04s)]
*  and the 150 years of precedent that's been established in America, defining what it means [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=306.04s)]
*  to America and that they will ultimately reach that decision. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=310.8s)]
*  And I cannot imagine that the justices will determine that that history no longer exists [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=313.72s)]
*  and is not important or was decided incorrectly. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=318.68s)]
*  But in the interim, what we've heard from the Department of Justice is that people would [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  lose their rights of citizenship if they move from my state to Idaho or if they move from [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=324.72s)]
*  New Jersey to Pennsylvania, because Pennsylvania did not participate in this case. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  And that's really absurd. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=334.12s)]
*  And the other thing that I would highlight is that not only are we talking about children [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=335.56s)]
*  losing their American citizenship, but there is a class of people that would not have [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=339.48s)]
*  citizenship of any country because the countries where the home parents might come from [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=343.4s)]
*  would not recognize their citizenship unless they were born in that country. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=349.12s)]
*  And so we're talking about people that would not have protection from America, but also [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=352.6s)]
*  from any country. And we can't let that move forward because of the protections that we [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=355.84s)]
*  provide for children in this country. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=360.36s)]
*  Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown, it's kind of you on a very busy day to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=362.52s)]
*  take the time to talk to us. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=367.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=368.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTJ5Fy8wqU&t=369.32s)]
