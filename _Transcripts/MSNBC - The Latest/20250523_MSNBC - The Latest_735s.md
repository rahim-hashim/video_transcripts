# That was FAST! Ari Melber on Trump losing to Harvard & dropping Dem case — but adding targets
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ)
*  Tonight, Donald Trump is losing again, including in key areas where he has tried to use or [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=0.0s)]
*  allegedly abuse government power to go after foes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=5.48s)]
*  But against those losses, he is doubling down on the so-called retribution tour. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=8.44s)]
*  So it's really a story of two sides of the same coin. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=14.14s)]
*  Here's how Politico, the nonpartisan Washington outlet, puts it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=17.8s)]
*  We've hit, quote, full throttle as they report the revenge campaign is expanding by the day [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=21.52s)]
*  with an ever-lengthening list of targets. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=26.6s)]
*  This is something we've seen not only this week, but over the past several weeks. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=30.060000000000002s)]
*  Trump sometimes loses. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=34.2s)]
*  Some folks fight back. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  Some judges and courts agree with the people fighting back against what in some cases has [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=37.24s)]
*  been found to be government abuse or illegal and unlawful efforts to go after people. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=42.1s)]
*  But then Trump, unlike really most modern presidents faced with setbacks, doubles down [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=46.7s)]
*  further, the testing sometimes courting defiance. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=51.64s)]
*  Facing the limits of what not only Trump but his aides can do in clearly risky ways, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=55.9s)]
*  as some people win when they fight back. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=62.699999999999996s)]
*  The former FBI director's use of the term 86 has sparked something totally different, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=65.02s)]
*  totally new, unprecedented, an investigation by the Trump administration. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  One of the real problems we have in this country right now is the use of the president's power [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=75.53999999999999s)]
*  aiming at individuals who don't have my background or experience. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=80.18s)]
*  U.S. Attorney Alina Haber has announced charges against New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=84.06s)]
*  McIver. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=88.38s)]
*  This is not typical to charge a member of Congress and neither is the way the Justice [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=89.38s)]
*  Department rolled it out. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=92.46s)]
*  It's political intimidation and I'm looking forward to my day in court. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=93.74s)]
*  Pursuing her on that day's incident for a related, now collapsed case and arrest the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=97.02s)]
*  same day of the Newark mayor. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=103.58s)]
*  We agreed to dismiss the case collectively. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=105.22s)]
*  I mean, obviously it was a baseless case. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=107.94s)]
*  The executive branch weaponizing government. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=110.1s)]
*  When you look at the investigations, it's a lot of critics of Donald Trump and Democrats. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=112.86s)]
*  Those who break the law should be prosecuted. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=119.62s)]
*  The Harvard community is reeling this morning after the Trump administration revoked its [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=123.02s)]
*  ability to enroll international students. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=127.26s)]
*  This is authoritarianism on steroids. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=129.82s)]
*  There you hear it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=133.18s)]
*  The escalation, what critics and foes call authoritarian tactics, even as in the first [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=135.94s)]
*  run, the early days as we wrap up a week where the big case against a Democratic mayor [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=141.78s)]
*  was yanked by the Trump DOJ itself. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=146.94s)]
*  We heard him there in that montage. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=150.46s)]
*  That's the Newark mayor. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=151.82s)]
*  So even as they lose that one on the Trump side and even as Harvard is getting some good [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=153.78s)]
*  signs, they just keep expanding the target list, which raises serious questions about [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=158.3s)]
*  what to do when even their losses aren't dissuading them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=163.86s)]
*  So I want to get right to it tonight. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=168.28s)]
*  Gene Robinson, the Pulitzer Prize winner, joins us and knows his way around so many [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=170.29999999999998s)]
*  of these issues. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=174.05999999999997s)]
*  And for a more political perspective, an Obama campaign veteran, Che Comanduri. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  Welcome to you both. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=180.5s)]
*  Gene, I show how this is going. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=182.05999999999997s)]
*  And we have another Harvard law firm headline here tonight I'll start with. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=186.26s)]
*  Some firms bent. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=190.5s)]
*  But now you have a judge striking down the order that targeted Jenner and Block. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  That's one of these firms. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=195.82s)]
*  The ruling saying that Trump is, quote, trying to chill legal representation they don't like [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=197.06s)]
*  by punishing lawyers. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=201.94s)]
*  The fairest way I can put it, Gene, is governments are allowed to issue orders and test things. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=204.06s)]
*  But when they find out they're illegal, they have to stop. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  And that's really what is now being tested as we go into this holiday weekend in the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=215.02s)]
*  next couple of weeks. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=218.74s)]
*  On the law firms, on that mayor I mentioned, they are being told to stop. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=220.02s)]
*  Yeah, being told to stop, but they're not stopping. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=225.5s)]
*  I mean, they keep doing these things. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=228.1s)]
*  And maybe this is what we have to look forward to for the foreseeable future. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=231.54s)]
*  This isn't so much testing the boundaries of what executive power, of what the president [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=237.34s)]
*  can do, because in some of these cases, he's being told, absolutely, you can't do this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=243.94s)]
*  And yet he does it to somebody else, or he does it maybe in a slightly different way, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=250.98s)]
*  or he does it more, and says, well, can I get away with that? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=256.74s)]
*  And so the courts, once again, have been the sort of final protection, our final protection [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=261.82s)]
*  against really an out-of-control executive. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=271.86s)]
*  And this may have to go on for a while, because I don't know how we make him stop other than [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=276.42s)]
*  telling him no, no, no. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=282.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=285.62s)]
*  Che, we all know the term politics as usual. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=286.62s)]
*  This isn't supposed to be politics as usual. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=291.22s)]
*  Letting it become usual, even if they eventually back down, the Trump DOJ did drop the case [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=294.3s)]
*  against the mayor, quickly. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  But they still think politically, that's why I turned to you on the politics, they think [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=302.72s)]
*  they're getting something out of it, and that not everyone will be like the mayor or James [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=305.86s)]
*  Comey, and want to deal with this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=310.3s)]
*  So I leave that for your reflection, Che. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=311.74s)]
*  We'll get your answer. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=313.78s)]
*  I just want to share what the mayor, in his own words, Baraka, told us about that case [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=314.78s)]
*  being pulled. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=319.26s)]
*  This was earlier this week. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=320.42s)]
*  Our lawyers and their lawyers got together and made a quick decision that this should [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=323.62s)]
*  be not tried in any court at all. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=328.18s)]
*  I think this is clearly being driven by their desire to do what was said earlier, to hurt [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=331.42s)]
*  people, to embarrass people, to humiliate folks. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=336.14000000000004s)]
*  And they'll go further than that if they can. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=339.62s)]
*  Che. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=343.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so the couldn't Tarantino's kill bill opens with the line, revenge is [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=344.02000000000004s)]
*  a dish best served cold. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=350.58000000000004s)]
*  The problem is that Donald Trump is serving us revenge piping hot. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=352.98s)]
*  And that's actually the political problem. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=357.54s)]
*  This is something that is designed entirely just for his base, entirely to show that he [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=359.86s)]
*  is an authoritarian, that he is showing masculine dominance over his enemies. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=365.22s)]
*  But it's not reaching the average American. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=370.90000000000003s)]
*  And Donald Trump's approval ratings are dropping because he's pursuing things like this. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=375.3s)]
*  Frank Sinatra, somebody that Trump says was a friend of his, Nancy Sinatra says Sinatra [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=380.54s)]
*  loathed him. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=385.78000000000003s)]
*  Sinatra said the best success, the best revenge is massive success. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=387.18s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump really wanted revenge on his enemies. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=392.14s)]
*  He could do it by governing well. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=395.5s)]
*  He could do it by taking the economy Joe Biden left him and improving it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=397.46s)]
*  Instead, he's actually doing the reverse. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=401.5s)]
*  And he's spending all his time pursuing these revenge targets that are, frankly, very poorly [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=403.06s)]
*  thought out and seem totally impulsive like everything else he does. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=408.86s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=413.06s)]
*  Eugene? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=414.06s)]
*  Yeah, it does seem to be massively counterproductive, what he's doing, because, as Chay said, his [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=416.02s)]
*  approval ratings are not good. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=423.86s)]
*  He's doing these crazy things with the economy that make everything worse rather than better [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=425.94s)]
*  today. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=435.5s)]
*  He announces 50 percent tariffs, and then Scott Besson takes it back. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=436.5s)]
*  And then he says, no, no, no, really, we're going to do 50 percent tariffs against Europe, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=441.66s)]
*  and the markets fall. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=446.42s)]
*  I mean, and that's not a good look for this president, who just so loves to portray himself [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=447.42s)]
*  as successful in all things, especially as successful in business. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=456.54s)]
*  So again, is it just impulse, or does he think there's actual political gain in all of this? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=461.5s)]
*  I'm not sure, but it's clearly not really working in his benefit. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=471.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=479.66s)]
*  I mean, and it can be both. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=480.66s)]
*  There may be someone who thought, well, let's have an immigration-related clash. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=482.14000000000004s)]
*  They've clearly courted that and going after a local judge. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=486.42s)]
*  That case is murkier. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=489.06s)]
*  And now two indictments in the ICE facility clash, which was not murky. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=490.94s)]
*  Many accounts discredited the legal claim by the DOJ. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=495.74s)]
*  And as I mentioned, one case dropped. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=499.54s)]
*  And so it may be that Jeans point both. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=501.22s)]
*  It may be that they thought, oh, this is immigration. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=502.5s)]
*  We want to push that issue, yada, yada. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=505.1s)]
*  But then some incompetent people rushed the arrest without finding out that there was [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=507.18s)]
*  public video evidence showing the authorities welcoming the mayor in, which is the opposite [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=512.24s)]
*  of trespassing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=517.1800000000001s)]
*  Che, I want to turn to another setback that Trump just got today by giving you a tough [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=518.1800000000001s)]
*  quiz that you may not get. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=523.3000000000001s)]
*  And we won't be disappointed if you don't get it. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=525.3000000000001s)]
*  Since Che brings up culture, what do Natalie Portman and Conan O'Brien have in common that [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=529.82s)]
*  relates to the Trump retribution era we are in? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=535.6s)]
*  They both went to Harvard. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=539.34s)]
*  Natalie Portman attended, I believe, from 2000 to 2004. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=541.54s)]
*  She's a movie star. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=547.1s)]
*  Then in the movie Social Network, they talk about as being the most famous person on the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=548.1s)]
*  campus. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=551.42s)]
*  And Conan O'Brien also attended Harvard. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=552.42s)]
*  There you go. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=553.4200000000001s)]
*  So I'll jump in. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=554.4200000000001s)]
*  You got it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=555.4200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=556.4200000000001s)]
*  They both came from other countries. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=557.9799999999999s)]
*  A lot of Americans like how they've contributed to this country, but they're one of the many [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=560.18s)]
*  talented people who came here, legally, I should mention, and in demand. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=566.5s)]
*  Harvard's not that easy to get into. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=571.2199999999999s)]
*  And so the way that the Trump administration thought it would, quote, punish Harvard as [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=572.9s)]
*  they are in this standoff over even larger issues was shut down their ability to bring [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=577.78s)]
*  in future students from abroad to Harvard. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=582.76s)]
*  Now the government does have wide authority in general on that. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=586.26s)]
*  For example, if there's a security reason, that's hard to overcome. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=589.22s)]
*  But this looked so punitive that here's the headline from the New York Times, and this [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=593.74s)]
*  is breaking today, Judge blocks new Trump effort to bar international students at Harvard. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=596.98s)]
*  Che, another area where they're losing in court and the chosen battle lines are no longer [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=602.62s)]
*  alleged gang ties, but rather whether Americans like Conan being here. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=610.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=615.74s)]
*  I mean, I think that they thought that Harvard would be a really good target because it's [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=616.74s)]
*  the ultimate elitism, except for the fact that many members of the Trump family went [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=620.74s)]
*  to Harvard, including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=626.54s)]
*  And it also shows how poorly thought out this whole thing is. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=631.86s)]
*  You know, I got news for you. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=635.02s)]
*  Harvard will probably be fine. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=636.1s)]
*  There is no university that has the financial resources that Harvard University has. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=637.86s)]
*  You know, it basically has a corporation that's the size of some small countries in some cases. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=643.82s)]
*  And so to pick a fight with Harvard, you know, is just such a poorly thought out piece of [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=650.9s)]
*  strategy. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=657.46s)]
*  It just shows you the kind of impulsiveness that is driving the Trump revenge agenda. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=658.46s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=663.0600000000001s)]
*  Gene? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=664.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a misreading, I think, because in the case of Harvard, I think maybe on some [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=666.02s)]
*  level they just thought Harvard would cave, that Harvard would give up, and they didn't [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=674.38s)]
*  take into account that Harvard does have the resources to wait out the entire Trump administration [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=680.8599999999999s)]
*  if it wants to, amid all these punishments that are being attempted. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=689.1800000000001s)]
*  So it was just a bad strategy to begin with, to pick on somebody who's big enough to hit [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=698.4200000000001s)]
*  you back. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je_v1EVwEGQ&t=706.78s)]
