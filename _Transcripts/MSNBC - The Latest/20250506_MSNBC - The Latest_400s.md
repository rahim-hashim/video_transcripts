# 'He can, in fact, be stopped': Buttigieg exhorts Democrats to show voters more in fight with Trump
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc)
*  We are back with former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg as promised. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=0.0s)]
*  We're going to talk about a lot of politics. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=5.64s)]
*  So let me just start here. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=7.04s)]
*  There's been, to state the obvious, a ton of conversations about the future of the Democratic [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=8.24s)]
*  Party. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=13.16s)]
*  You've been about a part of a lot of them. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=14.16s)]
*  I think this is a really healthy thing that's happening right now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=15.88s)]
*  And I wanted to read you something Senator Bernie Sanders said this week that I think [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=18.96s)]
*  you probably agree with, but I just wanted to talk to you more about it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  He said, the American people, I think, not only want resistance to Trump, but I think [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=25.72s)]
*  they want what the Democratic Party in the last many years has not given them. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=29.64s)]
*  And that is an agenda that speaks to the needs of the working class because it's not good [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=33.6s)]
*  enough. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=37.24s)]
*  Now, you may not agree with all of that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=38.24s)]
*  We should talk about that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=39.24s)]
*  This sounds to me though a little, I'm old enough to remember when you ran for the chair [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  of the DNC and you make kind of a similar point. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=44.08s)]
*  You've been kind of saying something similar. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=46.64s)]
*  So I guess what does that look like to you? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=49.28s)]
*  I think this is really correct. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=52.68s)]
*  Look, we have got to make sure that our opposition and everything that we're against, and obviously [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  there is a lot to be passionately against right now, but it has to travel with a clearer [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=61.32s)]
*  picture of what we are for because there are a lot of voters who, for whatever reason, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=66.16s)]
*  and Democrats might be shocked by this, but for whatever reason, did not find any of the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=71.12s)]
*  things they've seen so far about Donald Trump to be disqualifying. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=74.56s)]
*  And what that means is there's something else that, it doesn't mean they necessarily loved [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=77.32s)]
*  him, but they need to see something more. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=80.52s)]
*  This is not a question of accommodating things that we don't agree with or watering down [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=83.92s)]
*  or changing our values. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=89.04s)]
*  It is a question of making very clear to everybody how your everyday life is different if we're [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=90.04s)]
*  in charge compared to if they're in charge. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  What your life could be like if wages went up the way that we propose that they be raised. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=98.0s)]
*  What we would do with the money if we successfully stop the tax cuts for the wealthy that are [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=103.2s)]
*  at the core of Donald Trump's economic agenda. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=108.82000000000001s)]
*  What we think could happen in a country where we had paid family leave and some of the unfinished [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=111.42s)]
*  business of fixing our health care system. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=115.94s)]
*  It's not just a matter of preserving the Affordable Care Act, as important as that is. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=119.1s)]
*  It's going the next step to make sure everybody can get and afford health care. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=122.9s)]
*  All of these things that need to happen, that needs to be as clear a picture as our response [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=126.58s)]
*  to the authoritarian tendencies of this administration. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=132.28s)]
*  Because the truth is proto-authoritarian governments don't just come out of nowhere. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=135.7s)]
*  We would not be in this situation if the government, the economy, and the politics [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=140.14s)]
*  of our country were healthy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=146.92s)]
*  They've been unhealthy for a long time. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=148.55999999999997s)]
*  I think everybody knows that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=150.22s)]
*  If my party seems like it's calling for a return to the status quo from before, that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=152.2s)]
*  will be both substantively wrong and politically it will fail. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=158.22s)]
*  The other part of that there's been some, again, healthy debate about is, is it a policy [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=164.0s)]
*  question, is it a messaging question, is it a where you appear question? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=169.5s)]
*  You've talked about all three of these. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=172.70000000000002s)]
*  Let me just start with the policy question. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=174.1s)]
*  Do you think the policies of the Democratic Party, the party you've been a part of, need [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=176.1s)]
*  to be more ambitious and bigger than what we've seen over the last couple of years? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=179.9s)]
*  In some ways, yes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=184.22s)]
*  Look, the fact that income inequality has grown under Republican and Democratic administrations [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=185.22s)]
*  tells us there's more that needs to be done there. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=190.5s)]
*  And the fact that it is so hard to build and do things in this country, and I lived this [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=193.84s)]
*  when I was at the Department of Transportation. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=197.86s)]
*  We got 20,000 infrastructure projects done, but we could have done more if it were easier [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=200.26000000000002s)]
*  to complete the things that we start in this country and we could have done it more efficiently [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  with our dollar. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=209.58s)]
*  There's a lot of work that needs to be done there, too. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=210.58s)]
*  So yes, there are substantive policy things that we need to revisit for the simple reason [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=212.82000000000002s)]
*  that so many of the systems that we inherited, that we, meaning progressives, built after [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  World War II are now confronting a reality in what's coming up to be the second quarter [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=222.3s)]
*  of the 21st century, that's just so, so different than the world we were in. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=226.98s)]
*  But as ruthlessly as we need to leave behind anything that's not working, we need to relentlessly [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=231.18s)]
*  defend anything that is, whether we're talking about Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  or any of the other core commitments that make us who we are. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=243.24s)]
*  As a part of this, I mean, you've also talked a little bit about how we can't fight every [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=247.38s)]
*  battle. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=250.66s)]
*  You can describe what you mean by this, and I agree with this, and I understand what you're [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=251.66s)]
*  saying. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=254.18s)]
*  It's you have to prioritize what you're emphasizing publicly. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=255.18s)]
*  And a lot of what you just said to me was about domestic issues, things that impact [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  people's lives who are just living day to day. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=261.1s)]
*  What are the battles you think shouldn't be a part of the public fight that Democrats [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=264.54s)]
*  are fighting right now? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=268.7s)]
*  Look, I think the legal strategy is different from the political strategy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=269.7s)]
*  Both are important. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=274.26s)]
*  So some of the most important setbacks and defeats of the Trump White House have been [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  fighting it out on turf that maybe hasn't been as politically strong for us. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=279.98s)]
*  I think USAID, which by the way, to be clear, I passionately believe in the mission of USAID, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=284.46s)]
*  and I believe that the right kind of development aid and foreign aid is both morally right [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=288.94s)]
*  and strategically smart. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=293.58s)]
*  But look, I get that that may not. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=294.98s)]
*  There's a reason why they picked that as one of the first agencies to destroy, knowing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=297.06s)]
*  that a lot of Americans are sitting at home saying, you know, what does this have to do [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=301.38s)]
*  with me? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=304.36s)]
*  But they also very clearly violated, at least in my opinion, violated a lot of laws when [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=305.94s)]
*  they did that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=310.14s)]
*  And some of the legal opposition that stood up in response to that demonstrated that he [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=311.14s)]
*  can in fact be stopped. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=315.97999999999996s)]
*  So look, a political strategy and a legal strategy aren't always the same thing. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=317.5s)]
*  But what's really important about the legal work that's being done, the fights that are [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  happening in the courts, whether it's on comfortable political ground or not, is that they establish [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=324.8s)]
*  that they can be stopped and they establish when they're actually acting outside of the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  rule of law. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=334.06s)]
*  Some of the free speech issues. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=335.06s)]
*  We may or may not disagree with an op-ed that a student writes or a protest, everything [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=337.18s)]
*  said in a protest that they attended. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=343.18s)]
*  But what I know is that in this country, you should not be stuffed into a van or picked [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=345.3s)]
*  up off the street or thrown into detention because of an op-ed you wrote or a protest [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=350.32s)]
*  you showed up ever. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=354.5s)]
*  That's just a fundamental thing. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=355.62s)]
*  And by the way, the libertarians and the conservatives should be in lockstep with progressives on [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=356.94s)]
*  this, that that is just wrong. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=361.42s)]
*  No question about that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=364.1s)]
*  I have a lot of thoughts on free speech. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=365.18s)]
*  I suspect I will be sharing on this show in the coming weeks. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  Peter Poojage, it's always a pleasure talking to you. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=369.78000000000003s)]
*  You always say interesting things and I can talk to you about so many things. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=372.38s)]
*  So thank you so much for being here for our first 9 p.m. show. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=374.98s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=377.18s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=378.18s)]
*  Congratulations on the premiere. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=379.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwB6aL_Ubc&t=380.18s)]
