# ‘Dems are Wile E. Coyote’: GOP strategist says Trump is trapping the left with Harvard fight
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4)
*  of the class of 2025 from down the street, across the country, and around the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=0.0s)]
*  Around the world just as it should be. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=19.92s)]
*  Welcome back to Way Too Early. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=26.22s)]
*  Just before 5.30 on the East Coast, 2.30 out west, I'm Ali Vitale, and that was Harvard [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=27.779999999999998s)]
*  University's president alluding to the ongoing battle with the Trump administration during [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=32.379999999999995s)]
*  a graduation speech yesterday. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=36.379999999999995s)]
*  Meanwhile, a temporary win for Harvard with a federal judge extending an order, at least [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=38.42s)]
*  for now, that prevents the Trump administration from revoking the school's ability to enroll [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=42.82s)]
*  international students. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=47.099999999999994s)]
*  The university faced off against the Trump administration in a Boston courtroom yesterday. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=48.46s)]
*  The judge's ruling extends the terms of a restraining order issued last week, allowing [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=53.0s)]
*  the school to continue enrolling foreign students. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=57.36s)]
*  The Trump administration argued that Harvard's 31% foreign student enrollment rate is putting [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=60.62s)]
*  American students at a disadvantage while also claiming anti-Semitism at the school. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=64.64s)]
*  White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller reacted to the judge's decision last [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=69.76s)]
*  night. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=73.4s)]
*  It's been rightly called the judicial coup, and we are expecting, this issue is now before [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=74.4s)]
*  that they will swap down these district courts that have done such violence, such damage [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=81.6s)]
*  to our nation's democracy, and in fact, completely sabotaged our nation's democracy to a degree [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=86.89999999999999s)]
*  that we've never seen before. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=93.16s)]
*  Now, despite yesterday's ruling, the school's director of immigration services tells the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=95.16s)]
*  Washington Post that some foreign students are already reporting visa denials and revocations. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=99.32s)]
*  Joining us now, Republican strategist Matt Gorman. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=106.52s)]
*  He's a former senior communications advisor for Republican Senator Tim Scott. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=108.48s)]
*  Also with us, Jonathan Cot, he's a former advisor to Democratic Senators Joe Manchin [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  and Chris Coons. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=116.04s)]
*  So, Matt, you've said that every day the president is fighting Harvard is a good day politically. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  Because you're going to, first of all, you're going to be seeing a lot more Trump vs. Harvard [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  headlines than you've already seen them already. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=125.76s)]
*  Democrats are already the party in many ways of the higher-ed administrator. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=128.0s)]
*  That's why they lost the 2024 election. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=130.84s)]
*  They talk like them, and now they're being forced, because Trump is on the other side [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=133.0s)]
*  of it to defend all of these actions. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=136.76s)]
*  And so they're trapping them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=139.56s)]
*  And it might play well in a bubble in D.C. and New York, but Des Moines, Iowa, Plano, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=141.0s)]
*  Texas, being against Harvard isn't necessarily a bad thing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=145.48s)]
*  So Democrats are kind of like Wiley Coyote. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=148.6s)]
*  They're out five feet over the cliff. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=150.56s)]
*  They don't realize it until they're looking down. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=151.64s)]
*  There's nothing underneath them. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=153.12s)]
*  Are you Wiley? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=154.12s)]
*  I'm not Wiley. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=155.12s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=156.12s)]
*  Democrats shouldn't be defending Harvard. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=157.12s)]
*  We should let Harvard defend themselves against Trump. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=160.68s)]
*  But Harvard is doing the right thing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  They saw what Columbia did and caved immediately, and that was wrong. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=164.96s)]
*  They're fighting back. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=169.36s)]
*  They're going to win this fight because they're right on the merits. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=170.52s)]
*  And what's going to happen is Trump is going to get tired. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  He's going to keep losing in courts. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  He's going to find another shiny object to chase. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  And at some point, the Supreme Court is going to say, hey, if you want to know where these [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=181.52s)]
*  foreign students are from, call up Marco Rubio. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=185.32s)]
*  He has all of the information. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=188.18s)]
*  If he can take a break from the four jobs you've given him, he can hand over all of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=189.68s)]
*  this information and Trump will get tired and the taco Trump meme will come out. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=193.72s)]
*  He will get angry and he will pick another fight with somebody else and will move on. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=199.48s)]
*  But Democrats should not be the ones defending Harvard. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=204.0s)]
*  We should let Harvard do this all on their own. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=206.88s)]
*  They have tons of money. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=209.28s)]
*  They have lobbyists. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=210.6s)]
*  They have PR teams. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=212.48s)]
*  They can do this all on their own. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=213.68s)]
*  Jesus, every top lawyer in the country went to Harvard. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=215.32s)]
*  Half the Supreme Court went to Harvard. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=218.68s)]
*  They're fine on their own. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=220.8s)]
*  Democrats don't need to get into this fight. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=222.16s)]
*  Yeah, you bring up taco Trump. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=225.0s)]
*  It's why I've been wanting tacos all week. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=226.64s)]
*  But it's a phrase based off of his tariff policy where we've seen the courts once again [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=228.96s)]
*  gumming up the administration's efforts on this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=235.64s)]
*  But are there any Republicans who might privately say that's kind of a good thing because the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=238.84s)]
*  tariff policy has been whimsical and very unpredictable, much to the chagrin of the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=243.5s)]
*  markets and Republican lawmakers? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=248.04s)]
*  I think no matter what, though, the uncertainty of the markets is what's hurting these negotiations [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=249.44s)]
*  anyway. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=253.28s)]
*  Even the best case scenarios we talked about, there's open negotiations done, but we're [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=254.28s)]
*  seeing now China negotiations stalling EUs probably the same way because why would they [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=257.48s)]
*  negotiate if one minute the tariff's going to be odd, the next minutes they're going [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=261.52s)]
*  to be gone? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=264.6s)]
*  The courts are creating leverage for the opposition party anyway. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=265.6s)]
*  There's no way you're going to see it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=268.96s)]
*  Well, they're creating leverage just based on their own rulings in the courts, not with [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=270.16s)]
*  political stuff. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=273.12s)]
*  Yes, but in essence, in actuality. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=274.12s)]
*  There's not going to be any pushback on the tariffs. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=277.96s)]
*  This is part of his agenda. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=280.2s)]
*  He's been clear on this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=281.2s)]
*  You're not going to see any Republican pushback on the Congress on this. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=282.2s)]
*  And I think there was a Democratic theory of, well, at some point the market tomorrow will [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=285.68s)]
*  just be so bad that either Trump will have to make a U-turn on this, taco, or someone [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=290.12s)]
*  will have to step in, whether it's the Senate or advisors saying, all right, we can't keep [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=296.12s)]
*  doing this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=299.96s)]
*  But it does feel like the markets are starting to factor in the unpredictability. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=300.96s)]
*  So is that the end of the Democratic plan there? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=304.56s)]
*  Have they presupposed the wrong notion here? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=307.16s)]
*  No, I think, look, Treasury Secretary stepped in. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=309.16s)]
*  He helped. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  Congress is not going to step in. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  Republicans have already said, we don't want any part of this. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=315.96s)]
*  They're not going to step in on tariffs. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=319.48s)]
*  They have said, we don't want to take the votes on this because they know at some point [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=321.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's not going to be on the ballot and those senators are going to have to face [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  voters and say, hey, I took this stupid vote and raised prices on you and Donald Trump's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=330.08s)]
*  not going to be there to defend me. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=337.4s)]
*  Mike Crapo has already said, we're not adding this to reconciliation, even though Trump [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=339.48s)]
*  has said this will be billions and billions of dollars. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=343.08s)]
*  No, we don't want any part of this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=346.24s)]
*  So I think all of Congress has said, President, this is on you. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=348.4s)]
*  And Democrats are happy to let him make this fight, watch the markets go up and down. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=352.0s)]
*  The uncertainty is what's killing him. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=357.16s)]
*  And he fights it every day back and forth with these crazy tweets and press conferences. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=359.16s)]
*  And that's what's hurting him. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=364.56s)]
*  It's the uncertainty. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=365.92s)]
*  And these other countries see it and they say, we'll just step back. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=367.04s)]
*  We'll let you fight this out amongst yourselves and then come to us at a weaker position. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  Do you think, Kot, that the step back is also going to be similar on Russian sanctions, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=375.6s)]
*  specifically this package that has 80 people who are backing it in bipartisan fashion, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=380.04s)]
*  and yet it's up to Republicans on whether or not it hits the floor? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=384.8s)]
*  I think until they see some value in pushing back on Trump, they're not going to put it forward. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  It's very easy to co-sponsor a bill or say you support a bill when you know you're never [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  going to have to vote for a bill. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=401.96s)]
*  That's the easiest thing to do in Congress. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=403.92s)]
*  And there are tons of bills that have 80 co-sponsors in the Senate that will never get a vote. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=405.64s)]
*  Until they have to take that vote and defy Trump, there'll be 80 for the four years of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=410.8s)]
*  his presidency and it will never come up. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=417.88s)]
*  Yeah, even as some lawmakers, including Lindsey Graham, write op-eds urging the importance [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=419.68s)]
*  of this kind of a sanctions package against the backdrop of stalemate ceasefire negotiations [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=424.32s)]
*  between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=429.12s)]
*  And then the other piece of news this week, Matt, that I think all of us have been waiting [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=430.6s)]
*  for and now we're finally seeing it come to fruition. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=434.68s)]
*  We'll see President Trump and Elon Musk do a press conference of sorts in the Oval Office [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=436.72s)]
*  later this afternoon. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=440.4s)]
*  Even if Musk is gone, Trump is saying he'll always be with us. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=442.08s)]
*  But politically isn't that true? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=445.44s)]
*  There has been a political backlash to Musk and Doge that you can look at in Wisconsin [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  and Florida, isolated incidents in off years, but still instructive. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=452.08s)]
*  Republicans are they concerned about the Musk factor even though he's gone? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=457.4s)]
*  I think Democrats might want Musk to always be with them, but I think trotting out Elon [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=460.08s)]
*  Musk over a year from now in campaign ads is going to be quite a heavy task. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  We'll have hopefully a law passed by then. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=469.28s)]
*  There'll be things that Democrats will certainly try and use. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=472.28s)]
*  Republicans will try and fight back on that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=474.52s)]
*  But I think trying to resurrect Doge in the same way, say, the Wisconsin Supreme Court [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=475.84s)]
*  race did is going to be very hard for Democrats. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  Good luck to them. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=482.67999999999995s)]
*  And of course, the Friday afternoon press conference, a tried and true tactic. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=483.67999999999995s)]
*  We'll see how much it gets coverage. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  But obviously, look, this was expected. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=489.35999999999996s)]
*  Government employee, his time was up anyway. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=491.79999999999995s)]
*  And I don't think many Republicans are terribly sad to see him go, especially in the cabinet. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=494.23999999999995s)]
*  According to reports. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=498.72s)]
*  But that being said, he can go back to his companies. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=499.72s)]
*  It's a good offering for him. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=501.96s)]
*  And they're giving us, Sophia said earlier, amicable breakup. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=503.24s)]
*  Yeah, amicable breakup. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=506.08s)]
*  At least that's the vibe that they are presenting, though all bets are off when we get that Friday [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=507.56s)]
*  press conference. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=511.40000000000003s)]
*  Coverage concerns aside. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=512.64s)]
*  We are sad to see him go. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=514.04s)]
*  We would love to keep him around. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=515.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's not in any way shocking. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=517.16s)]
*  Matt Gorman and Jonathan Cot, thank you both for joining us this morning. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFwbVhFeh4&t=520.52s)]
