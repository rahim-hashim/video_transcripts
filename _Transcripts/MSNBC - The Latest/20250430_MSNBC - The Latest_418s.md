# How will Dems fight back against Trump? One lawmaker calls it ‘Resistance 2.0’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM)
*  Joining us now another Democrat with a plan he calls resistance 2.0 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=0.0s)]
*  Texas congressman Greg Casar chair of the Progressive Caucus. It's good to see you congressman [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=4.72s)]
*  What exactly does resistance 2.0 look like to you? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=10.32s)]
*  And how are you doing getting other more moderate members on board or are you? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  in this fight back we need to put as our central message that the Democratic Party is [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=19.92s)]
*  committed to breaking the unholy alliance between [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Corporate greed and corrupt government and that brings Democrats together across the political spectrum [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=30.24s)]
*  And in fact, it's something that independents and conservative voters and Trump voters believe in too [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=36.72s)]
*  That's how we fight back against Donald Trump [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=42.76s)]
*  Itself, what's the reality of it because I know you have to know this and you've watched some of the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=46.68s)]
*  Town halls and I know you actually hosted three town halls in Republican districts [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  There's a lot of frustration out there. They hear those words, but they don't see the action [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  Democrats need to stand and fight in this moment [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=66.8s)]
*  Unfortunately a hundred days ago when Trump was elected [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=70.88s)]
*  Democrats were in the wilderness and some political pundits said that the strategy for Democrats was to roll over and play dead [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  That's what the pundits were saying [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=81.72s)]
*  But the people the people were seeing at these town halls [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=83.48s)]
*  They want us to stand up and fight and I think the people have won that argument over the pundits and now the Democratic Party is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  Finally shaped shaping up. Look, let's be honest a hundred days ago [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=92.72s)]
*  There were Democrats that were asking should we go play footsie with Elon Musk? But now our party is shaped up [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  We're going toe-to-toe with Elon Musk [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=102.44s)]
*  we're talking about finally taxing those billionaires raising worker wages and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=104.76s)]
*  Opposing the Trump agenda in a way that actually brings new voters in rather than sort of just sticking to our existing voters [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=110.32s)]
*  And I think that's what makes this fight a more important and high-stakes fight even than the one we were in eight years ago [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=117.16s)]
*  Under the first Trump administration, of course a lot of people who feel the way you do are pinning hopes on the next election in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=123.52s)]
*  2026 hoping that it will not be a government that is totally controlled by Republicans [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=129.72s)]
*  Just months after your colleague and fellow progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=135.56s)]
*  Failed in her bid to become ranking member of the House Oversight Committee [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=139.92s)]
*  The job will be open again because Jerry Connolly says he's going to step back soon [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=143.4s)]
*  Do you believe a progressive can win powerful positions like that that will be incredibly powerful should the Democrats be in control? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=148.2s)]
*  of the house in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=157.04s)]
*  2026 where are progressives in this? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=158.6s)]
*  Progressives are leading this fight across the country [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=163.04s)]
*  I was recently with Senator Sanders and representative Ocasio-Cortez and Tucson, Arizona [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=166.06s)]
*  We thought that in this mid-sized American city [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=172.3s)]
*  We could fill a high school gym with 2,000 people at a rally instead [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=175.62s)]
*  23,000 people showed up that covered the entire football field. It was the biggest rally [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=180.54s)]
*  We know of in Arizona history people are mobilized. They are angry [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=184.7s)]
*  They want to fight back [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=189.1s)]
*  But they also want a democratic party with a renewed spirit that is about workers and not about [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=189.9s)]
*  Sort of playing footsie with the billionaire class and look that message is important because that same message [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=196.26000000000002s)]
*  I took on stage in Tucson, Arizona with Bernie and AOC [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=201.82000000000002s)]
*  It's the same message we can use on Fox News the same message [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  I'm using in town halls in Republican districts because this is the reality of the Trump administration [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=208.58s)]
*  He said he was going to be for workers [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=214.70000000000002s)]
*  But instead he's put the billionaires in charge and if we point that fact out [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=216.1s)]
*  We don't have to wait till next election to slow them down [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=220.9s)]
*  we can start pulling Republican votes off of the Trump agenda and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=223.06s)]
*  Saving our Medicaid saving our Social Security and rebuilding the Democratic Party right now [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=227.18s)]
*  He believes that the number one issue that he wants to highlight is immigration and the actions that he has taken [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=232.3s)]
*  He just said in questions and answers at at the meeting the cabinet meeting [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=239.5s)]
*  He had praising the actions that his administration has taken giving the borders much making the borders much more safety [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=244.82s)]
*  Saying it's the most significant thing he's done [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  But I want to play for you what he said about immigrants during his Michigan rally last night [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=256.38s)]
*  These people are criminals if they had their way we would be living in a third world hellhole. That's what they want [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=263.53999999999996s)]
*  Removing the invaders is not just a campaign pledge. It's my solemn duty as commander-in-chief [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=271.78s)]
*  I have an obligation to do it [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=277.46s)]
*  Save our country a fact-check which we like to do the crime rate again. We said this earlier among immigrants lower [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=281.62s)]
*  Pretty significantly than for people born in the US [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=289.18s)]
*  But I have to ask you as the son of Mexican immigrants have facts been overrun by the messenger [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=292.74s)]
*  We have to make very clear what Trump is actually doing to our communities [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=301.34s)]
*  He's deporting US citizen children [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=307.06s)]
*  Including not just one but multiple US citizen children with cancer taking them away from the treatment [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=310.98s)]
*  They need the people that he is arresting many of them have no criminal history [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=316.86s)]
*  At all in raid after raid in many of my communities in Texas the vast majority of people have no criminal history [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=322.65999999999997s)]
*  We have to be clear about why Trump is using this oldest trick in the book [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=330.26s)]
*  He wants to target vulnerable communities [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=334.4s)]
*  He wants to talk about immigrants all day and categorize them as criminals rather than the people that build our country [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=337.84s)]
*  Because he doesn't want us to be hitting him where it hurts [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  Which is the fact that the economy has gotten so much worse [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  Since he got into office the fact that people are losing their jobs at an unprecedented rate the fact that costs are going up [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=351.18s)]
*  Trump wanted to blame immigrants for things like costs going up when it ultimately is Trump and his billionaire friends [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=357.18s)]
*  That are jacking up prices. So we should defend [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=364.3s)]
*  to process human rights civil rights for all people in this country native-born and immigrants alike and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=368.18s)]
*  Then hit Trump where it hurts and make it clear that he shouldn't keep on scapegoating immigrants or queer [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=373.78000000000003s)]
*  Students and instead we should be talking about the fact that the billionaires are jacking up your prices [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=380.06s)]
*  The billionaires are getting a tax break while you are having to pay higher prices at the grocery store [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=384.82s)]
*  That's the fight back that we need in Trump 2.0 [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=389.78s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for coming on the show. Appreciate it. Thank you [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=393.54s)]
*  You [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dm-FG3v7VM&t=414.82s)]
