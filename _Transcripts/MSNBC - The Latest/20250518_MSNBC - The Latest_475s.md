# 'Deeply wrong': Episcopal Church leader on why they refused Trump's Afrikaner request
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk)
*  Joining me now is Bishop Matthew Hyde, head of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you, Bishop, for joining us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=6.76s)]
*  You and I have worked together on several projects. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=9.96s)]
*  Nothing, I think, though, moved me more as a historic occasion than the church standing [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  up on this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=17.76s)]
*  Tell us how your church arrived at this very difficult decision. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=19.12s)]
*  We're very proud of what the presiding bishop did this week, Rev, because it so deeply [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=24.88s)]
*  honors what we value, to respect the dignity of every human person and to care most for [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=29.92s)]
*  those who are most vulnerable. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=38.36s)]
*  What the government had asked Episcopal migration ministries to do, as the presiding bishop [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=40.6s)]
*  said, was exactly the opposite. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=45.0s)]
*  The work of migration ministries across the United States has been deeply compromised [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  by the administration's policies, and this decision this week honors what we value and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=53.699999999999996s)]
*  avoids complicity with something that's deeply wrong. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=59.3s)]
*  Now for those at home who don't know the history, why are religious groups involved in the task [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=63.46s)]
*  of refugee resettlement in the first place? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=68.7s)]
*  Well, we believe this work is core to our faith, core to the gospel, to welcome people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=72.02s)]
*  who have come fleeing danger from all over the planet and helped them find safe home, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=79.14s)]
*  safe belonging here. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=87.7s)]
*  And as you well said, Episcopal migration ministries has been doing this work for 40 [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=89.78s)]
*  years in administrations of both parties, and so this so fully honors what we value [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=94.94s)]
*  and receives people in a way that helps them find a new life. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=102.82s)]
*  We used to call this the American dream. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=105.9s)]
*  Now I noticed in the bishop's statement, he talked about how they had a great working [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=108.1s)]
*  relationship with the churches in South Africa. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=114.62s)]
*  They were concerned about the racial aspect of this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=118.34s)]
*  We talked in the last segment about one of the Afrikaner refugees who, according to reporting, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=122.26s)]
*  has made anti-Semitic comments on social media in the past. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=128.58s)]
*  That man has argued his comments were taken out of context. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=132.46s)]
*  But I also was interested to learn that he's being helped now by a Jewish resettlement [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=135.76s)]
*  organization. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=140.72s)]
*  Your church made the difficult but understandable decision not to help these particular refugees. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=142.44s)]
*  How do you remain hopeful that this resettlement, even if it's being done for questionable [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=148.56s)]
*  reasons, could still lead to a dialogue that could be helpful? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=153.48s)]
*  We're always looking for dialogue and for conversation. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=157.68s)]
*  The Episcopal Church of the United States has been changed by relationship with the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=162.08s)]
*  church in South Africa. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  We were, as you were, active in the fight against apartheid in the 80s and the 90s and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=167.44000000000003s)]
*  saw how reconciliation was possible. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  And the Archbishop of South Africa, the Anglican Archbishop of South Africa, thanked the presiding [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=177.68s)]
*  bishop for this decision this week because it honors our partnership, honors what we [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=181.88000000000002s)]
*  learned and how we've been changed by this relationship globally. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=185.84s)]
*  Human rights globally comes back to civil rights locally, and this decision respects [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=190.0s)]
*  that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=195.96s)]
*  Now, this isn't the first time the Episcopal Church has waited into politics, not even [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=196.96s)]
*  the first time in this Trump term. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=202.24s)]
*  I last spoke with you in March on this show after Bishop Moraine Buddy, Marion Buddy, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=204.96s)]
*  angered the president by urging him to show mercy to groups who felt they might be targeted [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=212.6s)]
*  by his incoming administration during the inaugural service. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=218.96s)]
*  How do you think this Trump presidency is challenging the spiritual mission of your [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=224.0s)]
*  church right now? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think what's happening out in the world encourages us to step up and step forward [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=230.96s)]
*  and to speak up for what we believe and for the people in all of our communities, all [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=237.32s)]
*  of our neighborhoods who are most vulnerable. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=241.52s)]
*  And I'm proud that Bishop Buddy did that in January. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=244.0s)]
*  I'm very proud of what the presiding bishop did this week. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=246.88s)]
*  I'm proud of how our local congregations across New York, and I know it's true across [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=250.68s)]
*  Episcopal Church, are stepping up every single day to work with our neighbors, to create [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=254.8s)]
*  new dialogue and to be part of seeing each other for places of safe belonging in the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=259.88s)]
*  world. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=265.52s)]
*  We are challenged by this moment, and Episcopal Church is stepping up to respond to the challenge. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=267.08s)]
*  Before I let you go, I know we're out of time, but I must get your take on the new American [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=272.68s)]
*  pope. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=277.48s)]
*  The head of the Catholic Church has a major influence over the role that all faith groups [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=278.48s)]
*  play in the global humanitarian and advocacy work. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=283.4s)]
*  What is your impression of the Pope Leo so far? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, we are praying with our Roman Catholic siblings in the United States and around the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  world and know how excited our siblings in the United States are for the election of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=295.64s)]
*  the new pope. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=300.76s)]
*  The new pope has deeply moved all of us. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=301.76s)]
*  His history in Peru, walking the streets, being with people, has exactly what we want [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=304.2s)]
*  to do locally here in New York and across the United States. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=310.24s)]
*  And so we look forward to working ecumenically to welcome the new pope and to be churched [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=313.68s)]
*  together at this moment, step up to what God's called us to do. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  Now, as I've said, you and I have worked together for the last few years or months [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  and various causes to help the needy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  We have other things we're planning to continue to do, especially in the area of migrants [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  and the needy. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=338.2s)]
*  In your opinion, how do we change hearts and minds in the country so we can start to discuss [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=339.2s)]
*  immigration in terms of compassion and not competition? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=346.26s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=351.23999999999995s)]
*  As Reverend Rev really well said, we are, all of us, part of shaping the culture right [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=353.76s)]
*  now and we have the chance, every single one of us, to shape a culture of generosity rather [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=358.12s)]
*  than a culture of scarcity. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=364.12s)]
*  To be people of care, connection and courage, rather than cruelty, carelessness and loss, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=365.88s)]
*  we can do this together. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=376.4s)]
*  And so we're going to give the opportunity this summer for people to tell their stories [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=377.4s)]
*  about how they're doing these small acts in all of our communities. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=381.64000000000004s)]
*  We are forming culture together and we can be part of a rising in this moment and we'll [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=385.48s)]
*  do that together. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm grateful for the partnership, Rev. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  And part of that partnership, you've reached out to imams from the Islamic community, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=393.56s)]
*  Rabbi Potasnik and the Jewish community. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=398.76s)]
*  How in these polarizing times can faith leaders and the church have the spirit you've demonstrated [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=401.36s)]
*  here? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=408.36s)]
*  And the presiding bishop has demonstrated now that we can disagree without being disagreeable [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=409.36s)]
*  and there's some values and principles that we should all uphold. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=415.32s)]
*  There are so many things we share, beginning with an affirmation of human dignity and the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=421.92s)]
*  opportunity to care for each other. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=427.96000000000004s)]
*  There is always opportunity for dialogue and to be changed by the dialogue together. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=430.56s)]
*  I've experienced that and you and I have done that together. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=434.6s)]
*  And I think that's absolutely the way forward to form this culture of generosity, to stop [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=437.96s)]
*  the chaos that has been so present in these last months. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVp4CTanOk&t=442.88s)]
