Video Description: Dozens of Project 2025 policies have made their way into President Trump’s agenda within the first 100 days, despite candidate Trump distancing himself from the policy handbook. From education policy to the mass firings of federal workers, Trump is literally governing by the book.

# 'Permanent changes to government:' Project 2025 takes center stage in Trump’s first 100 days
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y)
*  All of the changes that President Trump is making to our government and our democracy are shocking, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=0.0s)]
*  but should not come as a surprise. Remember this? Almost all of it, from the attacks on abortion [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=4.4s)]
*  rights, to the gutting of the civil service, to the dismantling of the Department of Education, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=10.72s)]
*  it was all spelled out very clearly in Project 2025. It was always accessible to the public. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=13.92s)]
*  We knew what was in it. We knew who was writing it. And we knew what they were planning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=20.88s)]
*  We knew that the architects of it were drafting executive orders in anticipation of Trump's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=25.12s)]
*  victory. We knew they were training a new class of political appointees to outmaneuver [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=29.12s)]
*  checks and balances. Only 104 days into his presidency, Donald Trump has already pushed [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=33.6s)]
*  through dozens of Project 2025 policies that we warned about on this show last year. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=39.2s)]
*  If you had to wager a guess about the most dangerous chapter in Project 2025, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=47.52s)]
*  this is the 922-page conservative playbook for a new Trump administration, what would it be? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=52.08s)]
*  This Project 2025 thing, it's not an easy read. Project 2025 would encourage the next [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=57.6s)]
*  conservative administration to place the FBI under more quote politically accountable end [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=62.56s)]
*  quote leadership, which are code words for more loyal to the president. Project 2025 vows to slash [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=68.72s)]
*  the federal workforce and replace what's left of it with Trump loyalists. Project 2025 says that in [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=75.84s)]
*  an emergency situation when abortion would save the life of the pregnant person, medical personnel [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=82.4s)]
*  are not required to perform that life-saving abortion. An FBI that works at the whims of the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=87.04s)]
*  president arresting his political opponents, journalists, prosecutors, critics, even judges [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=92.4s)]
*  who don't do his bidding. Now that would transform the voice of America from a reliable [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=96.4s)]
*  journalistic publication for global audiences to a personal propaganda machine for the president. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=100.4s)]
*  Transforming our federal government from groups of qualified experts to unblinking yes men, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=106.72s)]
*  Project 2025 states quote the Biden administration's climate fanaticism will [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=111.84s)]
*  lead a whole of government unwinding. The next conservative administration should rescind all [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=116.48s)]
*  climate policies from its foreign aid program, specifically USAID's climate strategy 2022 to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  2030. Shut down the agency's offices, programs, and directives designed to advance the Paris [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  climate agreement. Project 2025 urges the Justice Department to go after quote providers and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=132.72s)]
*  distributors of medication abortion. I'm sorry but did somebody ask for this? No one involved in [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=138.32s)]
*  Project 2025 has any interest in a government of checks and balances. Project 2025 seeks to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=143.68s)]
*  create a federal government that answers only to the president and a president who answers to no one. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=149.44s)]
*  I wish I could say I'm some sort of psychic but it was all right here, all out in the open. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=157.84s)]
*  All right joining me now David Graham, staff writer at the Atlantic, author of a particularly [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=163.68s)]
*  important and pertinent book, The Project, how Project 2025 is reshaping America and the world. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=167.28s)]
*  Also joining me Zach Beachham, senior correspondent at Vox who covers right-wing populism [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=172.48s)]
*  and challenges democracy in the United States and abroad. Zach is also the author of The [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=176.56s)]
*  Reactionary Spirit, how America's most insidious political tradition swept the world. Good morning [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=181.84s)]
*  to both you guys, thanks for joining us. David let me start with you. You could make the argument [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=187.44s)]
*  that the first hundred days haven't been great for Trump but if you were involved in the writing [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=192.16s)]
*  of Project 2025 you got to be over the moon. This thing is a rapid deployment of all this stuff [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=197.2s)]
*  that's in the 922 pages. That's right and we've seen Paul Danz organize this saying that it's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=204.96s)]
*  beyond his wildest dreams. I also think the architects understood that a lot of the things [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=211.44s)]
*  that they wanted to do would not be popular and so they understood the first hundred days were [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  really essential and they wanted to push as far as they could in those first hundred days before [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=219.6s)]
*  other institutions and the people of the United States had time to push back on it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  Not be popular is an understatement. I mean before the election polling indicated that Project 2025 [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=229.12s)]
*  was polling deeply negatively with voters. What's kind of amazing is the way they put it all in the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=235.04s)]
*  book. Donald Trump said got nothing to do with me even though it was written by people who were all [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=241.92s)]
*  involved with Donald Trump and who said that he was just doing that to be political. But in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=245.2s)]
*  fact it was unpopular then. Polling now indicates it remains unpopular. So what gives here? It was [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=249.52s)]
*  unpopular before, it's unpopular now, but it's still happening. I mean it's an ideological design, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=257.68s)]
*  right? It's not supposed to be we're doing what the public wants in the sense of you know we have [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=266.08s)]
*  done focus grouping and we figured out what the thing is that we're trying to maximize in order [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=273.12s)]
*  to like be most popular. It's that they believe they have a once in a generation attempt to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=278.0s)]
*  revolutionize the structure of the American government to move it into something that more [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=283.76s)]
*  closely resembles something like Viktor Orban's regime in Hungary. I don't think they would [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=287.84s)]
*  explicitly say this but if you look at the policy details as they're laid out the end result of it [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=291.84s)]
*  is something that very much does resemble what political scientists might call a competitive [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=296.8s)]
*  authoritarian regime. One in which you know the opposition is playing on fundamentally loaded [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=299.92s)]
*  playing grounds and that is what's happening right now. Granted they're doing it very badly. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=305.84s)]
*  If I were a foreign autocrat I'd be a little bit embarrassed to say that these people are [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=313.52s)]
*  following my playbook but that is nonetheless what they're attempting. So David let's think about [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=317.11999999999995s)]
*  this and I think this is an interesting point Zach makes and that is there's a thing called [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=322.55999999999995s)]
*  unitary executive theory. There's the destruction of the administrative state some of which the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  Supreme Court has helped with. These are concepts of governing that project 2025 is underpinned by [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=331.52s)]
*  and Zach's right. People don't think about these things. They literally don't think about these [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=341.44s)]
*  things so when you dismantle USAID they're only a small group of people who will actually protest [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  that even when you dismantle things that matter to Americans like the National Institutes of Health [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=350.4s)]
*  and their funding of universities. People don't realize that the medication that they get to cure [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=355.35999999999996s)]
*  the diseases they don't even know they're going to get are funded by the government. But it's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=360.0s)]
*  conceptual reframing of how the American government runs. How badly can that go? In other words can [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=365.68s)]
*  the next president just undo this stuff and fix it? Well Zach is totally right and he can. I mean I [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=372.88s)]
*  think one of the things that makes project 2025 so important and so influential is they have thought [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=379.6s)]
*  deeply about how to make permanent changes to the structure of government and you know you can roll [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=384.4s)]
*  back executive orders you can try to restore funding for things but you're not going to bring [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=389.2s)]
*  back the brain drain. You're not going to restart the things that are going on. So I think the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  government that the next president inherits is going to be just very different from the one that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=397.2s)]
*  Trump did on January 20th. Zach let's talk a little bit about you brought up Viktor Orban right. Here's [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=400.4s)]
*  an interesting example. He continues to win elections in in Hungary. It's like a lot of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=408.56s)]
*  other countries where if you if you're in Budapest before an election everybody thinks oh we've [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=414.48s)]
*  Viktor Orban is going to get wiped out but actually the rest of the country continues to vote for him. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=419.12s)]
*  People get attracted all through history toward authoritarian tendencies. Most people give up [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=423.44s)]
*  their democratic rights. They're not stolen from them. They're not taking revolution. Most people [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=430.72s)]
*  just slowly and slowly give up these things because they sound like solutions. Yeah you know the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=434.56s)]
*  Hungarian story is complicated and I think sort of demonstrative of what could happen in the United [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=441.36s)]
*  States in ways that are worth studying right. So when he won power right originally in 2010 that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=446.24s)]
*  was his second term technically but he did so on the basis of basically pledged to root out [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=451.68s)]
*  corruption and to deal with the fallout of the financial crisis. Ironically Hungary is now the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=458.48s)]
*  most corrupt country in the European Union. Setting that aside for the moment the point is there [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=462.72s)]
*  wasn't a mandate right for revolutionary change nor was there a mandate for revolutionary change [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=466.48s)]
*  in the United States right. Why did Donald Trump win in 2024? We know primarily because of inflation [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=470.72s)]
*  and secondarily because of people a perception of chaos at the border. And those things right [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=476.24s)]
*  these kinds of leaders take what is really a sort of very limited mandate and they use it to try to [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=483.2s)]
*  change an entire society in the ways that voters didn't choose. And in Hungary what they did was [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=489.04s)]
*  knock out the foundations of what allows for deliberation about the new policy direction of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=493.04s)]
*  the country. So they attacked the media right. They got their own people inside of the court so [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=498.72s)]
*  it was difficult to have public legal scrutiny or any judicial rollback of their actions. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=502.56s)]
*  And there's this whole thing that made it so that you know by the time the next elections rolled [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=507.76s)]
*  around even though most people in Hungary at this point did not vote for Orbán's party they won only [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=511.6s)]
*  a plurality of votes. They won two-thirds of seats in the parliament over two-thirds of seats [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=516.64s)]
*  because of gerrymandering right. There were a variety of so there's like a sort of textured [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=522.72s)]
*  layer of different tools used to make democracy less representative and eventually turned into a [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=526.88s)]
*  regime where elections you know they matter but it's very very hard if impossible for the opposing [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=532.72s)]
*  parties to win. In the United States they're just doing they're trying to do a version of that. I [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=537.36s)]
*  really am very convinced of that. The problem is they're not nearly so good at it as Viktor Orbán [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=542.48s)]
*  was and that should be a little encouraging for Americans I think. But important to note that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=547.92s)]
*  Viktor Orbán plays a starring role at every right-wing conference in America and on right-wing [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=552.48s)]
*  television and radio. David your recent piece in the Atlantic was titled Trump's ranting can't [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  change his polling numbers. Many people have pointed out including Donald Trump himself that [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=562.96s)]
*  as we've discussed he was open about his plans. Here's what he said to Terry Moran at ABC earlier [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=568.4s)]
*  this week. People are worried even some people who voted for you saying I didn't sign up for this. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=572.96s)]
*  So how do you answer those concerns? Well they did sign up for it actually and this is what I [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=580.64s)]
*  campaigned on. That's a little bit of gaslighting David but that was specifically in relation Terry [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=585.84s)]
*  was asking about the the economic issues and Donald Trump said I said there was going to be pain. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=594.24s)]
*  We of course didn't he didn't say that that was a post-election thing but tell me is I mean it's [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=599.76s)]
*  not a particularly compelling argument that you you voted for me and this is what you signed up [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGT7tucY-Y&t=606.08s)]
