Video Description: On May 25th, 2020, the Minneapolis Police Department released a statement saying “Man Dies After Medical Incident During Police Interaction”. The man in question was George Floyd and he was murdered by Officer Derek Chauvin. That initial police statement was false. And the truth only came out because of a 17-year-old with a cell phone camera. But, it should not be the work of a civilian to hold law enforcement to account. A cell phone with a camera should not be the only defense against police brutality.

# Velshi: A cell phone camera can’t be the only defense against police brutality
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4)
*  Five years ago, on the evening of May 25th, 2020, the Minneapolis Police [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=0.0s)]
*  Department released a statement with the headline Man Dies After Medical [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=4.68s)]
*  Incident During Police Interaction, end quote. The statement reads in part on [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Monday evening, shortly after eight PM, officers from the Minneapolis Police [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=14.24s)]
*  Department responded to the 3700 block of Chicago Avenue South on a report of a [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=17.92s)]
*  forgery in process. Officers were advised that the suspect was sitting on top of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=23.6s)]
*  a blue car and appeared to be under the influence. Two officers arrived and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=28.68s)]
*  located the suspect, a male believed to be in his forties in his car. He was [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=33.12s)]
*  ordered to step from his car. After he got out, he physically resisted [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=37.36s)]
*  officers. Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=41.6s)]
*  appeared to be suffering medical distress. Officers called for an [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=45.78s)]
*  ambulance. He was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center by [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  ambulance, where he died a short time later, end quote. The unnamed man in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  his forties who died of an apparent medical incident was George Floyd, and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=58.54s)]
*  that initial police account was a lie, a flat out blatant lie, a lie which they [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=62.78s)]
*  were probably going to get away with if it wasn't for a teenager with a cell [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=70.1s)]
*  phone. Darnell Darnell. A Frazier was a 17 year old at the time she was walking [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=74.22s)]
*  to the corner store with her nine year old cousin when she witnessed a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=78.88s)]
*  commotion outside the store. So she took out her phone and she hit record. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=81.28s)]
*  Darnell. A Frazier did not capture George Floyd suffering medical distress. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=85.5s)]
*  As the police report stated, Darnell. A Frazier captured Minneapolis police [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=89.58s)]
*  officer Derek Chauvin's knee on George Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=93.17999999999999s)]
*  seconds. She captured George Floyd crying out for his mother. She captured [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=97.94s)]
*  George Floyd's final words. I can't breathe. She captured George Floyd's [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=102.86s)]
*  murder on camera. Darnell. A Frazier captured the truth. That took courage. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=107.7s)]
*  She kept recording even as Officer Chauvin reached down and put his hand [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=115.86s)]
*  on his can of mace. She displayed more courage than the other police officers [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=119.3s)]
*  on the scene who could and who were legally and morally compelled to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  physically intervene but did not. Darnell's brave decision to hit record [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=126.44s)]
*  changed the trajectory of this case. It shifted public perception of what [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=131.36s)]
*  happened that day. It prompted a worldwide movement. I would say it led [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=135.02s)]
*  to justice for George Floyd, but true justice would be if George Floyd were [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=139.18s)]
*  alive today without Darnell. A Frazier's courage. The world probably would [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=143.10000000000002s)]
*  have believed that initial police account and George Floyd's family may [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  never have gotten any semblance of closure. But the thing is, it should not [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=151.94s)]
*  be the work of a 17 year old civilian to hold law enforcement to account. A [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  cell phone with a camera should not be our defense against police brutality. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  George Floyd was one of many, too many unarmed black people who were killed by [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  police in the last 10 years. Brianna Taylor, Dante Wright, Ah, Tiana, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=169.88s)]
*  Tiana Jefferson, Botham Jean, Philando Castile, Alton Sterling, Eric Garner, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=173.89999999999998s)]
*  Tamir Rice, Elijah McClain, Tyree Nichols. There's no way I could even get [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=179.62s)]
*  through the list. There are many more, but these are some of the names you [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=184.7s)]
*  know because there was either cell phone footage or police body camera footage [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=190.24s)]
*  or witness accounts of what actually happened to them in many cases, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  contrary to what the police said happened to them. We think of George [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=197.28s)]
*  Floyd's murder as the catalyst, but his death actually capped off a decade of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=201.0s)]
*  high profile deadly interactions with police. It didn't end police brutality, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=205.12s)]
*  but it did lead to some change and some accountability. President Biden came to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  office. His Justice Department investigated or oversaw nearly a dozen [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  local police departments accused of civil rights violations. It was an [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=219.0s)]
*  effort to reform local law enforcement agencies in the wake of so many high [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=222.66s)]
*  profile killings. One of the investigations provide produced a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=227.14s)]
*  scathing federal report that found that the Minneapolis Police Department [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=230.68s)]
*  routinely discriminated against black and Native American people and use [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=234.94s)]
*  deadly force without justification. After some of these investigations, the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=239.32s)]
*  Biden administration made agreements known as consent decrees with police [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=243.86s)]
*  departments. A consent decree is a legally binding court enforced [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=247.92s)]
*  agreement. Basically, the Department of Justice identifies the problems within [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  a police department and then sets new requirements around how police should [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=256.08s)]
*  be trained and disciplined and evaluates officer recruitment and outside monitor [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=259.84s)]
*  and a judge ensure that the department the departments are complying with the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=264.84s)]
*  consent decree. This sometimes lasts for years. By a large, experts say [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=269.02s)]
*  consent decrees work. They're an effective tool for police reform. Many [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  troubled police departments struggling to reform would not get the resources [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=277.24s)]
*  they need to update their policies and training without federal consent [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=280.68s)]
*  decrees. Well, the Trump administration doesn't see it that way. Four days [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=284.44s)]
*  before the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's murder, Trump's D. O. J. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=289.36s)]
*  announced it was abandoning oversight efforts of local police departments. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  Trump officials say they plan to drop the consent decrees made with [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  Minneapolis, where George Floyd was murdered and with Louisville, where [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=301.28s)]
*  Brianna Taylor was killed in a botched police raid, and they will close the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=304.46000000000004s)]
*  civil rights investigations into several other police departments. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=308.02000000000004s)]
*  So once again, it's one step forward, two steps back. It's like this [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=312.66s)]
*  administration is saying, Why bother making sure our police departments are [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=316.98s)]
*  following the most basic civil rights requirements? What's the big deal? I [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=319.98s)]
*  guess those cell phone cameras are gonna have to do for now. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=324.5s)]
*  In 2021, one year after the death of George Floyd, Darnella Frazier, the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  17 year old with a cell phone reflected on social media, she wrote in part [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=331.54s)]
*  quote, It made me realize how dangerous it is to be black in America. We [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=335.82s)]
*  shouldn't have to walk on eggshells around police officers, the same [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=340.54s)]
*  people that are supposed to protect and serve. She adds a lot of people call [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=343.34s)]
*  me a hero, even though I don't see myself as one. I was just at the right [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=347.42s)]
*  place at the right time. Behind this smile, behind these awards behind the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=350.38s)]
*  publicity, I'm a girl trying to heal from something I'm reminded of every [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=354.78s)]
*  day. Everyone talks about the girl who recorded George Floyd's death, but to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  actually be here, be her is a different story. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMLBQrwyw4&t=364.74s)]
