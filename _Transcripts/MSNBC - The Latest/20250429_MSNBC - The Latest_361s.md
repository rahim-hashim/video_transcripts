# 100 days of 'increased costs, never-ending chaos and unprecedented corruption': Sen. Padilla
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM)
*  Joining us now, Democratic Senator Alex Padilla from California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=0.0s)]
*  He sits on both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Budget Committee in center. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=3.02s)]
*  It's great seeing you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=6.66s)]
*  One hundred days in, we're seeing what President Trump's massive deportation program in the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=8.1s)]
*  U.S. looks like. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  Is this not what the American people voted for? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=15.82s)]
*  It is absolutely not what the American people voted for, Jose. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=18.18s)]
*  One hundred days, one hundred days of increased costs, never-ending chaos, and certainly unprecedented [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=22.42s)]
*  corruption. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  That's what we're getting in the first hundred days of this Trump administration. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  Before I go on, Jose, I just want to take a moment to say thank you for the privilege [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  of your time. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=38.92s)]
*  I know this is the last week of this particular show. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=39.92s)]
*  You're not going anywhere, but just appreciate the opportunities you've had for me to come [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=42.92s)]
*  on so many times over the years. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=48.34s)]
*  And frankly, just thank you for your professionalism and for giving voice to perspectives of all [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  these issues. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  Immigration, economy, education, health care, particularly for the Latino community that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=56.24s)]
*  deserves to grow. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=61.74s)]
*  So coming back to President Trump and immigration, what was sold during the course of the campaign [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=64.02s)]
*  was that he would focus and crack down on violent criminal undocumented immigrants for [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=73.18s)]
*  deportation. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=79.58s)]
*  And what we've seen for the last hundred days is anything but that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=80.58s)]
*  He's trying to take credit for maybe some who fit that description. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=83.62s)]
*  But so many of those that have been detained, so many of those that have been deported, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=88.26s)]
*  are not violent criminals. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  We've seen the cases of not just fathers, but mothers providing for their families that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=96.42s)]
*  don't have a violent criminal history being detained, being deported. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=102.22s)]
*  Now we have intensive children that are caught up in this. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  That's shameful. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=111.3s)]
*  It's counterproductive. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=112.3s)]
*  It is not consistent with our nation's values. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=113.3s)]
*  And it's costing us a whole heck of a lot. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=117.1s)]
*  The military flights, Guantanamo, paying El Salvador to house, if Donald Trump had his [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=118.94s)]
*  way, United States citizens in prisons abroad, this is far from what the American public [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=125.78s)]
*  supports. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=131.94s)]
*  Senator, how would things or should things be different when the candidate Trump was [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=133.57999999999998s)]
*  very clear, I don't think there's a surprise to anyone, of what he said he wanted to do [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=142.85999999999999s)]
*  and what he has done. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=148.98s)]
*  There was even talk of, well, if U.S.-born children have undocumented mothers and the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  mothers are being deported, they should have the opportunity to stay with their mothers. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=159.54s)]
*  None of this has been a surprise. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=164.73999999999998s)]
*  And so what is it that should be done, Senator? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=167.34s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=172.1s)]
*  It's not a surprise because Donald Trump did promise the largest deportation operation [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=173.1s)]
*  in our nation's history. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=177.42s)]
*  But I don't think he said, but I don't think that the American people, both sides of the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=178.42s)]
*  We're expecting that this would happen without due process, without the respect to the law [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=185.34s)]
*  that we have in place because immigrants, documented and undocumented, still have due [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=192.82s)]
*  process afforded by the Constitution of the United States. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=197.74s)]
*  We have this, you know, innocent until proven guilty in other contexts, but even in immigration [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=202.3s)]
*  proceedings, the right to counsel, the right to speak to an attorney, when that is denied [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=206.9s)]
*  and undermines your chances of making a claim here, maybe you're seeking asylum, maybe you're [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=213.5s)]
*  making some other case that needs to be respected. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=218.54s)]
*  You don't always get your way, but the due process, the fairness of the process is certainly [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=222.26s)]
*  lacking here because of the cruelty, the carelessness of the Trump administration. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=228.38s)]
*  Senator, in addition to all these deportations, the president signed new executive orders [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=233.98s)]
*  on sanctuary cities, also reinforcing English proficiency for commercial truck drivers. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=239.42s)]
*  How is this going to impact California and so many other states? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=245.14s)]
*  Look, a couple of things here. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=248.61999999999998s)]
*  The sanctuary cities piece again, longstanding law upheld by the courts, states and local [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=250.66s)]
*  governments cannot be compelled to utilize their resources to do the federal government's [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=257.58s)]
*  job for them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=261.5s)]
*  So, that's all a sanctuary policy suggests. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=262.74s)]
*  You know, the English language, that's all symbolic because once again, he's trying to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=266.1s)]
*  take everybody's attention away from the horrible economy that he has brought us. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=271.74s)]
*  He promised to lower prices on day one, and he's done the exact opposite, the price of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=276.58s)]
*  housing, the price of groceries, the price of everything is going up under the Donald [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=281.3s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=286.5s)]
*  And so what does he do? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=287.5s)]
*  On his worst days, he once again scapegoats immigrants and the Latino community specifically. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=288.84s)]
*  And Senator, I wanted, if I could, just thank you on so many levels for your consistent [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  and persistent, compassionate advocacy for what you believe and for always remembering [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=301.64s)]
*  the responsibility that we all have to make a difference and to shine a light where there [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=309.47999999999996s)]
*  is darkness and to focus on those who are often living in silence or are silent. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=316.16s)]
*  And I want to thank you for that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=322.6s)]
*  Our conversation will continue, but for these three and a half years that I've had the privilege [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=324.32000000000005s)]
*  of being on MSNBC, counting on your voice has been one of the lights. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=329.6s)]
*  And I want to thank you for that and so much more. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=334.46000000000004s)]
*  Thank you, Jose. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=337.0s)]
*  See you soon. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=338.0s)]
*  Thank you very much, Senator. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=339.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjaZaP6YPAM&t=345.16s)]
