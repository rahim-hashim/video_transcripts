# Greenland is ‘worried’ U.S. will invade: Dem sounds alarm on Trump’s annex talk
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY)
*  Joining me now is California Democratic Congresswoman Laura Friedman, who is a first-term Congresswoman, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=0.0s)]
*  having taken over from Adam Schiff. And we're glad to have you. I will tell folks in the commercial break, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=6.4s)]
*  I said hello and said, you know, fellow L.A. girl to L.A. girl. But anyway, Congresswoman, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=11.36s)]
*  what do you make of your fellow Democrats and what they are doing today? Do you see it as being [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=16.48s)]
*  effective? Well, whether or not it's effective, I love that they're out just sitting on the Capitol [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=21.12s)]
*  steps talking to anybody who wants to walk up and talk to them. You know, being accessible, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=26.96s)]
*  being human beings, being willing to give up your Sunday to address people's concerns is important. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=31.6s)]
*  And the fact that they've gotten themselves on the news to elevate the important issues that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=37.68s)]
*  Americans are thinking about and talking about means that it's effective. Okay. What about the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=42.4s)]
*  number of new polls we've seen out this weekend? And they show support for Donald Trump at historic [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=48.32s)]
*  lows for a president nearing his first 100 days in office. Does this give a window for Democrats to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=53.92s)]
*  perhaps take advantage of? Well, I hope so, because I think that what's happening in the country right [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  now is a huge concern. And I'm glad that people are paying attention. And one of the reasons is [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  that people are feeling it right now in their pocketbooks. They're seeing the price of everyday [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=71.36s)]
*  goods go up. They see that the tariffs are having terrible effects on our small business. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=75.12s)]
*  People are worried about their Medicaid, health care access, social security, and they are [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=80.4s)]
*  out talking about this to their neighbors and to their elected representatives. And I do hope that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=87.36s)]
*  people reflect that unhappiness with the Trump policies when they do come out to vote next time. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=93.04s)]
*  You may have heard our conversation prior to the commercial break, because we've seen these [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  sweeping deportation efforts by the Trump administration, which now include several [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=104.0s)]
*  U.S. citizen children being removed. Is there anything Democrats can do to stop these moves [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=107.92s)]
*  from happening in the first place or to fight back once they have taken place? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=113.2s)]
*  I really hate seeing our country slide into a police state where people can be thrown into a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=119.28s)]
*  vehicle by unmarked whoever, officers on the street, and deported or taken into custody without any [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=125.68s)]
*  transparency or any due process. That is not the America that I grew up in. It's not the America [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=132.72s)]
*  that I think any of us know and love. That's the way that dictators act. So making sure that we [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=138.72s)]
*  shine a light on these abuses every time they happen is tremendously important so that the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=145.44s)]
*  American people see what's happening. In our immigrant communities, we see fear. We see widespread [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  fear. And I think that it's the cruelty of it, deporting American children, at least one of them [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=155.92s)]
*  in the middle of cancer treatment. That's not America. That's not our values. So we are fighting [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=161.76s)]
*  back with every tool we have, which is namely the legal system. We do have laws in this country. We [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  are a country of rules and laws, and the court system is taking this very seriously. And you [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=173.76s)]
*  now see the Trump administration trying to delegitimize the court system, to threaten and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  harass and dox judges and now even arrest a judge. But so far, the courts are holding strong, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=186.56s)]
*  and they are affirming and reaffirming due process and the rule of law. Let's get to the issue, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=193.12s)]
*  which part of Trump's 100 days has been his talk of expanding the United States by making Canada [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=200.0s)]
*  the 51st state, making Greenland part of the United States. You were part of a congressional [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=205.12s)]
*  delegation that went to Denmark, and you met with Greenland's officials there. What did you learn? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=209.76s)]
*  What did they tell you about either the likelihood or their desire to join up with the United States? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=215.04s)]
*  We heard from every person we spoke to, every elected official, every member of the press. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=223.92s)]
*  We met with the prime minister, the foreign minister. We met with a representative from [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  the indigenous population of Greenland. Resoundingly and overwhelmingly, they do not want to be part of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=233.2s)]
*  the United States, and they are very worried that we're going to invade. And this is not a joke to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  them. I was frankly surprised at how worried and anxious the elected representatives and the people [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=245.52s)]
*  of Denmark are right now. They believe that there is a chance that they're going to be at war with [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=253.76s)]
*  the United States. They actually think that we're going to invade Denmark and try to take Greenland [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=258.64s)]
*  by force. And why do they believe that? Because Donald Trump has signaled that that might happen. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=264.16s)]
*  We tried to reassure them that Congress is a co-equal branch of government. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=269.6s)]
*  It's up to us if we're going to declare war or invade another sovereign nation, a democracy, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=273.68s)]
*  an ally. But they're still worried, quite honestly. And Denmark, to be clear, is a very strong ally and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=278.88s)]
*  friend of the United States. The fact that Donald Trump is putting our friends and allies in this [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=286.08s)]
*  kind of position is something that should be a huge concern for all Americans. It's unacceptable. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=291.84s)]
*  It's certainly not the values of our country. We don't take over other democracies. We don't take [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=298.16s)]
*  over other countries. And I, frankly, am mystified, and everyone there is mystified, as to why Donald [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=303.04s)]
*  Trump is threatening this country and why J.D. Vance said that Denmark was a bad ally. There's [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=308.48s)]
*  nothing that they've done that's anything but positive towards the United States and our relationship. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKsJfEQwEY&t=314.24s)]
