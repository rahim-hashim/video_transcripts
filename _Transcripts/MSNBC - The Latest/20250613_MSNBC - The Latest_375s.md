# How will Iran retaliate? Ex-diplomat says regime could cause 'financial crisis' by cutting off oil
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34)
*  Back to our stop story this hour. We're on a stunning show of military strength by Israel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=0.0s)]
*  striking Iran with 330 munitions, over 100 sites, dropped by 200 fighter jets, according [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=6.0s)]
*  to Israel's military spokesman. Iran has since responded, directing 100 drones toward Israel. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=13.0s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News senior national security correspondent Courtney Qubee. Courtney, we [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=20.0s)]
*  just laid out some of those details from last night's attack. What does all this suggest [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=24.2s)]
*  about Israel's military capabilities and how sophisticated are their weapons systems and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=28.3s)]
*  their spy networks? Yeah, remember, Ana, back in October, the Israelis took a series of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=33.6s)]
*  pretty extreme strikes in Iran as well. In that case, they were able to basically dismantle [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=39.3s)]
*  or disable Iran's strategic air defense systems, their S-300s. So Israel has already shown [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=44.3s)]
*  the ability to take strikes deep inside Iran and to cripple some of their critical systems. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=50.8s)]
*  Now, what I was really struck by as last night unfolded and as the hours have gone by and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=57.3s)]
*  we've learned more and more about these Israeli strikes is not just the number that you just [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=62.3s)]
*  laid out there or the targets which are clearly surrounding the Iranian nuclear program that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=66.3s)]
*  includes both sites and individuals who they were going after. But I am really struck by the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=71.3s)]
*  fact that the Israelis are acknowledging that this is part of a longer-term campaign upwards [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=77.3s)]
*  of two weeks. Ana, that suggests to me that this is a real effort to do something the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=81.3s)]
*  Israelis have been trying, have been talking about for years, and that is not to disable or [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=86.3s)]
*  not to in some way slow down the Iranian nuclear program, but the goal here is ultimately to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=92.3s)]
*  destroy their program altogether. And I think the Israelis think because of a number of other [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=98.3s)]
*  factors that are going on right now, it seems they think this is the time that they might [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=103.3s)]
*  actually be able to do it. That's what I'm seeing unfold as this goes on. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=107.3s)]
*  So Courtney, do we know how damaged Iran's nuclear facilities are and just sort of the state of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=112.3s)]
*  Iran's capabilities, how they'll be able to, if they'll be able to respond in any kind of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=117.3s)]
*  reciprocal way? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=122.3s)]
*  So they haven't gone after all of the facilities, so it's definitely not the case that Iran's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=125.3s)]
*  nuclear capabilities or their program itself is disabled at this point. But it's definitely [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=129.3s)]
*  damaged from what happened last night. Iran has, you know, we hear so much about their [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=134.3s)]
*  nuclear program, but Iran has an advanced and extensive ballistic missile program as well. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=139.3s)]
*  Don't forget about that. They also have drones. They've already started firing some of those [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=145.3s)]
*  off at the Israelis. Iran will have the ability to respond. The question is, are they concerned [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=149.3s)]
*  about responding, what they may get back in return? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=157.3s)]
*  All right, Courtney Qubi, thank you very much for joining us with your reporting. And also with [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=161.3s)]
*  us now is Ambassador Mark Ginsburg, former presidential Middle East advisor and former U.S. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=165.3s)]
*  ambassador to Morocco. Ambassador, always great to have you with us. We've seen Iran begin to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=170.3s)]
*  launch some retaliatory strikes. What are your biggest concerns this morning? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=175.3s)]
*  Oh, they're threefold, Donna. First of all, of course, is Iran going to retaliate either directly [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=181.3s)]
*  against Israel with its reserves of ballistic missiles? Number two, will Iran launch terrorist [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=188.3s)]
*  attacks against the United States and Israeli interests around the world? And number three, if [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=196.3s)]
*  the regime feels even more threatened as a result of the new or next round of Israeli attacks, will [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=203.3s)]
*  it try to choke off oil supplies through the Straits of Hormuz and cause an international [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=210.3s)]
*  financial crisis? So those are all major impacts, obviously, not just on these two individual [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=215.3s)]
*  countries, but really the region, more broadly around the world when you talk about the oil impacts. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=221.3s)]
*  What is your sense of Israel's calculation? Why now? Especially given that President Trump had been [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=227.3s)]
*  saying, please hold off, we're in the middle of these Iran nuclear negotiations. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=233.3s)]
*  I've been talking to my friends in Israel overnight. As you may recall, I was raised there and I maintain [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=239.3s)]
*  extensive ties to its intelligence operatives. Israel came to the conclusion that over the last [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=245.3s)]
*  two weeks, Iran not only had decided to accelerate uranium enrichment way beyond what it had already [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=253.3s)]
*  assured the United States it was not, number one, and number two, it had reached a threshold of being [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=261.3s)]
*  able to weaponize the uranium that it had achieved. It was literally only three to five days away [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=268.3s)]
*  from being able to do what everyone said it was within weeks of doing, but was going to proceed [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=275.3s)]
*  while it was trying to create the impression that it was negotiating in good faith with the United [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=282.3s)]
*  States. How far is Israel planning to take this fight? At what point will we see them say, okay, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=287.3s)]
*  we're done? That's a hard question. I'll tell you why. Israel does not have fighter bombers. It has an [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=295.3s)]
*  excellent air force. But in order to really penetrate and do the severe damage to all of the 10 sites [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=303.3s)]
*  in which Iran is operating in its nuclear enrichment programs, it doesn't have the bunker busting [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=311.3s)]
*  capacity that at least it is needed. It's not that the United States or the Trump administration may not [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=318.3s)]
*  have wanted to provide it. Israel doesn't have an air force capacity, that is, bombers, to be able to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=325.3s)]
*  drop those bombs. So that's one of the reasons why Israel is going to keep trying to use its air force [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=332.3s)]
*  to pulverize these sites inch by inch, whereas it would have been probably able to take out these sites [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=338.3s)]
*  had it had fighter bombers to do so in a first strike. Ambassador Mark Ginsburg, I really appreciate your [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=344.3s)]
*  insights. Thank you very much for taking the time this morning. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=351.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wb86O6a34&t=374.3s)]
