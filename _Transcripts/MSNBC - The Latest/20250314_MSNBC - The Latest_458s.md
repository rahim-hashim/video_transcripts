# Most Americans think Trump's economic policies have been unsteady: Poll
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o)
*  With the stock market continuing to suffer deep losses, new polling finds a majority of Americans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=0.0s)]
*  think President Trump's economic policies have been unsteady since taking office. A new Reuters [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=4.88s)]
*  Ipsos poll finds 57 percent of Americans, including one in three Republicans, believe the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=10.32s)]
*  president is being too erratic in his moves to shake up the U.S. economy. The poll also found [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=15.44s)]
*  just 44 percent to prove of Trump's job performance so far. That number is unchanged from last month. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=20.32s)]
*  Joining us now for our political panel to end the week, Democratic strategist Joel Payne and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Republican strategist Matt Gorman. Joel, first to you, we started the show talking government [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  funding. We're going to end Friday talking government funding. Unclear that a shutdown [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=35.44s)]
*  will be averted, but what do you make of the way that Democrats have gone about this? First, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  saying we're absolutely going to fight this and then Schumer coming through and saying, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=43.6s)]
*  I'm going to vote for cloture, not the bill, but I'll allow effectively this bill to move forward. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=47.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a dated model. I mean, look at this phone, right? You know, we did this phone [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=52.64s)]
*  is a next generation phone. You can't have this, you know, 2025 politics that we're in kind of with [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=56.72s)]
*  old generation tactics. You can't fight, you can't fight, fight with flip phone tactics. And honestly, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=64.88s)]
*  I think that's what the base feels like. That's what the grassroots feels like Chuck Schumer and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=69.44s)]
*  Democrats have done. Also, you have to make a choice. Are you going to fight or are you going [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=73.44s)]
*  to be compliant? And I do think that many in the Democratic Party, they're searching for a strategy [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=77.68s)]
*  also searching for some sense that Democrats understand the fight that we're in right now. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=83.04s)]
*  Look through the Republican lens on this. I think many people thought that Mike Johnson was going [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=87.12s)]
*  to have the most problem children. He of course got a big boost from President Trump. Yeah. But [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=90.88s)]
*  what does this look like the way that you're watching Democrats handle this from a Republican [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=94.88s)]
*  perspective? Well, two things you're right there. There's a whole strategy ball down to hope Mike [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=99.28s)]
*  Johnson can't pass the bill. He passed the bill and they just kind of looked around on what do we [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=102.4s)]
*  do now? Right. And that's when the dynamic shifting we felt very confident. I see resemblance. No, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=105.68s)]
*  they're nowhere near where our party is now because we've been at this for almost 15, 20 [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=110.88s)]
*  years now where there isn't as much top down leadership in the House if there is any. Right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=114.8s)]
*  Certainly with McConnell gone. Absolutely. But with Pelosi gone, Biden gone, the old guard is [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=119.28s)]
*  gone among the Democrats and that top down leadership isn't there anymore. Democrats, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  like Republicans have been for quite a while now, far more willing and even eager to defy the leaders, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  especially in the House and a little bit in the Senate too. Such a generational disconnect. I mean, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=133.6s)]
*  yeah, you've got folks like Chuck Schumer was my old boss, Harry Reid, his generation. But let [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=138.4s)]
*  me just say this. You know what it is to be in the leadership office. That's right. I don't think [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=144.24s)]
*  Harry Reid would have done this fight the way Chuck Schumer did it, mostly because setting the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  expectations for your caucus and also for your grassroots. You needed to decide two months ago [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=152.32s)]
*  whether you want to fight on this. This fight was lost this week. Yes. And I just think that you're [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=157.84s)]
*  going to see a lot of frustration bubble up from the grassroots to the Democratic party. And I think [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  it was somewhat preventable. I agree in the conversations that I've had with lawmakers. I [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=167.68s)]
*  think many wished that there was a plan earlier. I only just started hearing House Democrats really [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=172.8s)]
*  applying pressure on this at the start of this week. And now, of course, they are voicing their [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  disappointment with Schumer. I think that's going to be a story with a long tail. But on the other [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  side of the aisle, the thing vexing Republicans is going home to these kinds of town halls that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=186.32s)]
*  we saw from Chuck Edwards and others in past weeks, having to defend on doge, on tariffs, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  specifically on the tariffs front. How do you defend that? Well, the town halls don't worry me [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=195.44000000000003s)]
*  as much. That's not the median voter yelling about Ukraine, number one. But broadly, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=199.84s)]
*  right, Republicans need to be able to tell a story on the economy. This is what I think trapped [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  Democrats with inflation. It was all spin. How can we get to the next week and then the next [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=208.0s)]
*  week and the next week? That's how it became transitory corporations, inflation. There's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  always an excuse. Republicans need, they're not doing that, but they need to tell something [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=216.8s)]
*  broader. They need to tell a story about what is this actually going to do? Why is this happening? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=221.04s)]
*  Why is tariffs, even though this is Trump would call Republicans a disturbance in the market, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=227.6s)]
*  why will it ultimately be a good thing? They haven't done that yet. They need to start doing [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=231.92s)]
*  that because that will not only come to the public with polls like you just saw, but come members, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  too. And that's a real fear, too. Members get jittery. Yeah, absolutely. And we can talk about [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  the campaign side politics of this, even though it's so far off in the future. But Joel, I had [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=245.2s)]
*  Congresswoman Camilla Giappola on earlier this week who said she thinks there's a big opening [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=249.6s)]
*  now on the economy. Dems have swung and missed at this issue before. But is there an opportunity [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=253.44s)]
*  in tariff storytelling now? Absolutely. I would disagree with my friend, Matt, right here. I think [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=259.6s)]
*  that Republicans are at their peril if they ignore the clear energy that's out there from the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=265.12s)]
*  grassroots. And again, not just grassroots Democrats. Yeah, they're grassroots Democrats. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=270.4s)]
*  I mean, okay, you can say that. And look, you used to work for the NRCC, right? Yeah. I want [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=275.12s)]
*  you to go advise your buddies at the NRCC right now. Go run a bunch of campaigns on what Elon [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=279.28s)]
*  Musk and Republicans are doing. Go tell them, spend a bunch of money on Elon Musk taking a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=283.28s)]
*  chainsaw to the federal budget. You wouldn't because it's not popular. And I don't think it's [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=287.11999999999995s)]
*  going to wear well for Republicans. And I think that's what the Congresswoman was suggesting to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=291.44s)]
*  you. And I can tell you, Democrats feel like Republicans really don't have an exit ramp for [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  now what? To what end? What do you want to do now that Elon Musk is taking a chainsaw to the budget? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  What's the long term plan? I don't think there is. The difference is when we were in the 2018 [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=305.92s)]
*  in the House with health care reform, there's those ads and those things were against that person. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=310.24s)]
*  Elon Musk isn't on the ballot. That's why his approval rates can mean the total all you want. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=315.36s)]
*  And yet there is the Wisconsin Supreme Court upcoming election in April. And this is, I think, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=318.8s)]
*  the first litmus test of is it efficient to try to tie Musk to all Republicans? He is funding [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=324.88s)]
*  various PACs in that race. Or do people not make the connection? I think what's unique about that, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=330.16s)]
*  though, is because also Republicans are using source in there. In a March election or April [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=335.2s)]
*  election in an off year, you need those bigger boogie men to try and scare the other party in. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=339.84s)]
*  When you're actually having a member of Congress on the ballot, it is a different dynamic in a [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=346.08s)]
*  midterm year or even later this year when you have the governor's races in a couple states. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=350.88s)]
*  The Musk doge stuff doesn't scare you as someone who knows the way that these campaigns are? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=355.68s)]
*  If you're running against Elon Musk, you're running against the wrong person. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=359.44s)]
*  That's why you're seeing Trump's approval ratings. Again, they're lower than they were a [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  month ago by five points, but they're nowhere near Elon Musk. He's the most famous special [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=366.64s)]
*  government employee that we've got. And I can tell you right now, but Democrats will make him on the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=370.4s)]
*  ballot and you know how that works. You can do it all you want, how to work for the Koch brothers. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  I just, I advise my Republican friends to, you know, see with a little caution. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=378.96s)]
*  I do think that this is actually the dynamic that we're going to be seeing playing out. And I know [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=382.88s)]
*  that this is the conversation that they are having within the campaign committees. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=386.56s)]
*  Do you think, I mean, I'll give the last word to you, Joel, since you're pro-tagging with Musk, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=390.72s)]
*  is this the right way to go about an early litmus test in a place like Wisconsin? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=396.16s)]
*  Of course. I agree with Matt. In isolation, no, it can't just be about Elon Musk, but it does have [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  to be tying Elon Musk to Donald Trump, to Mike Johnson, and to all these Republicans who aren't [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=404.48s)]
*  challenging them. And so I do think that you're seeing that work. I think you're going to see a [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=410.56s)]
*  lot of money flow into that Wisconsin race, a lot of special elections. And I do think Democrats [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=414.64s)]
*  have an opportunity to really tie that around Republicans' neck long-term. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  They definitely think they do. One of you may end up being right on this. And we'll have you back [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=423.84s)]
*  because I love it when we duke it out. And frankly, these are the conversations that we have over [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=428.0s)]
*  lunch and over breakfast. So I'm glad that we could do it in full view of our viewers. Joel and Matt, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=431.52s)]
*  as always, thank you both for ending the week with us. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrtTjYeu2o&t=444.64s)]
