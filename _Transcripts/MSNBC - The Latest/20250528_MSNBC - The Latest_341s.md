# 'Have to increase prices or we can't operate': Business owner on impact of Trump's tariffs
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s)
*  Let's take a check of the markets, which are down more than 100 points right now, about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=0.0s)]
*  2.5 hours before they close. Changing little, though, throughout the day. No, the biggest [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  driver of market volatility has been President Trump's tariffs. A new warning from a group [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=10.02s)]
*  of economic advisers to South Dakota's Republican governor concludes that they are driving up [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=15.16s)]
*  costs and slowing down housing development. They're not the only ones concerned. A new [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=20.28s)]
*  survey of 1000 U.S.-based companies shows 72% are already reporting higher operating costs due to tariffs, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=25.439999999999998s)]
*  forcing CEOs across the country to make tough calculations, whether to raise prices and, if so, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=32.8s)]
*  by how much. Joining me now, Chuck Gregorich. He is the CEO of Sunny Days Decor. It sells outdoor [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=38.72s)]
*  furniture, flower pots, fire pits. Thank you so much for joining us. I want just to sort of set [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  the baseline here. What is your reality? Will you have to raise prices? And if so, when? Yes, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  we'll be raising prices. We did a little bit in May. We're doing more in June and July. We had [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=59.72s)]
*  our containers come in at different times, right? In February, March, April, May, June. And then, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=66.52s)]
*  as we work through the old inventory and incur the higher-priced inventory, we will be increasing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=73.64s)]
*  prices somewhere between 5% and 15%. And it probably should be higher. It's just that we're [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=79.39999999999999s)]
*  eating some of the tariff costs. I know you spoke to the Wall Street Journal and gave them as one [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=87.08s)]
*  example, a Bistro set that now costs you $28 more. When you say you're eating some of it, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  can you go into your decision-making on raising prices? How do you decide when to do it? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=99.16s)]
*  By how much? And what are you hearing from your customers? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=104.52s)]
*  Yeah. We've already paid over a million dollars in extra tariff costs in the last two months. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  A million dollars? Over a million, yeah, already. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=115.88s)]
*  So we'll continue to pay more and more in tariffs each month as we bring in more containers. So we [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  have to increase our prices to where we can't operate. Our customers, because we're just in the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=127.08s)]
*  early point of increasing prices, they haven't said much yet. We haven't heard much yet. And [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=134.12s)]
*  when I say I'm eating some of that cost, for instance, some of these products got hit with [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=140.12s)]
*  the China, the Fentanyl tariff of 20%. They got hit with the steel tariff of 25%. So I had a 45% [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=147.72s)]
*  cost increase. So if I had a furniture set that cost me $100, I got another $45 in cost in there. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  So we didn't feel like we could raise our price enough to cover those $45. So we're eating some of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=165.8s)]
*  that cost. The consumer can only spend so much. And they only got so many discretionary dollars. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=174.12s)]
*  So we're trying to eat some costs when we can, just trying to be more efficient and watch our [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=181.0s)]
*  operating costs that we have locally here. Much of what your company sells is made in China. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=187.4s)]
*  You're not unique in that. And that has been the subject of these high tariffs. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=194.04s)]
*  Have they made you consider changing how you operate, how much you buy from China? Or, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=198.84s)]
*  as some people have suggested, it's not like you can go like this and suddenly source stuff [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=205.32s)]
*  from somewhere else and get it on a dime. Yeah. Chris, that's a good comment. We started this [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=210.2s)]
*  seven years ago. We started trying to source outside of China. We've been in business 19 years. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=216.44s)]
*  And over the last seven years, we were able to source about 25% of our volume outside of China. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=222.6s)]
*  But yeah, when October came around and it looked like Trump was going to win, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=230.44s)]
*  I went to my team. I said, guys, we need to get out. And so we really [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=234.84s)]
*  went back to all of our factories. We've been in India and Vietnam and Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=239.8s)]
*  two or three times a year the last three or four years post COVID. And we got a lot of contact. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=247.32s)]
*  So we are actively looking to get out. But it does take a while. And we're getting some luck. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=253.16s)]
*  But it's going to take us six to 12 more months to be completely [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=260.35999999999996s)]
*  out of China as much as we can be. And does it worry you that then, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=265.08s)]
*  we probably have to continue? That right after that, tariffs could go up on wherever you move [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=268.2s)]
*  your business to? Yes. Yeah. You know, we're concerned that we're in such a big limbo right [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  now because Trump put a 90-day pause on the countries outside of China that expires in [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=279.96s)]
*  July here, mid-July. And at that time, he could go back and print a bigger tariff on, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=287.48s)]
*  let's say Vietnam or India. And that would kind of mess up everything we've done the last six months. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=292.76s)]
*  And then with China being on pause right now, too, we're in such a limbo, we don't know what [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  to order. So we're just ordering the very minimum for everything, for all of our products. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  The CEO of Sunny Days Decor, Chuck, I do not envy you. The decisions that you have to make, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=310.68s)]
*  I do thank you for coming on the program. Thank you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vf_BfgIG5s&t=317.08s)]
