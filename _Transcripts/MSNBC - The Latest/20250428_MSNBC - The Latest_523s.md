Video Description: “The people who are going to be the roadkill are the consumers. It's the people that don't have the safety net. It's the smallest businesses. It's the small farmers.

# 'Roadkill': Trump trade war will 'hit rural Americans like you've never seen,’ says Klobuchar
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I)
*  It was a dire warning from the architect of Arizona's Medicaid expansion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=0.0s)]
*  You can't kill people to balance your budget. You just can't do that. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  We've got to come spending somewhere somehow in order to get our balanced budget back. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=9.0s)]
*  But it's not going to happen with Medicaid. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=13.4s)]
*  Even Jan Brewer, who is the former Republican governor of Arizona, is blowing the whistle, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=16.0s)]
*  sounding the alarm on what is going on with the budget Republicans are advancing this week. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=22.0s)]
*  This is a budget that calls for $1.5 trillion, trillion with a T, dollars in spending cuts, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=26.4s)]
*  which would inevitably hit the social safety net programs that millions of Americans rely on. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=32.4s)]
*  I'm talking Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=37.0s)]
*  Beginning yesterday and going into today, Democrats have been protesting. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=39.8s)]
*  Outside the Capitol on Sunday, Democratic Senator Cory Booker and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=44.0s)]
*  held a more than 12-hour sit-in protest, along with supporters, religious leaders and fellow lawmakers [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=49.4s)]
*  who spoke out about the impact of the proposed Republican cuts. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=55.4s)]
*  What's happening right now is not just happening in our urban areas. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=59.4s)]
*  It is happening in our rural areas in a big way. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=66.4s)]
*  They are dependent on these food programs and SNAP. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=69.4s)]
*  And the farmers that produce the food that goes to the schools, that goes to the school lunches, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=72.4s)]
*  that goes to the SNAP programs are just hanging on an edge. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=78.4s)]
*  Among the lawmakers who attended the sit-in was Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat of Minnesota, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=83.4s)]
*  and she joins me now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=88.4s)]
*  I will note, as the protests continue today, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=89.4s)]
*  Reverend Barber and other clergy were praying in the Capitol Rotunda, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=92.4s)]
*  and he was removed from the Capitol Rotunda. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=96.4s)]
*  Police surrounded Reverend Barber, and they expelled everyone, including the press from the Rotunda, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=101.4s)]
*  to presumably arrest them, according to this report on social. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=106.4s)]
*  We did reach out to Reverend Barber. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=110.4s)]
*  He confirmed that he was removed from the Capitol Rotunda and arrested. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=112.4s)]
*  I will note, he's out now, folks. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=115.4s)]
*  We talked about this energy at the top of the show that we are seeing from not just Democrats, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=117.4s)]
*  but people all across the country, clergy, elected folks, not elected folks. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=123.4s)]
*  I was really struck by the 12-hour sit-in on Sunday. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=128.4s)]
*  A lot of the reporters were at brunch, okay, post-White House corner, finest dinner. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=133.4s)]
*  But I saw it on streaming. It was everywhere. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=137.4s)]
*  How did you come to find your way to the steps? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=139.4s)]
*  Well, you know, Senator Booker and Leader Jeffries, this was their idea, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=141.4s)]
*  and they brought people together. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=147.4s)]
*  And it wasn't just electeds, but when I heard about it, I'm like, okay, I'm going over there. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=149.4s)]
*  And I think that's what a lot of people do, because I was really surprised. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=154.4s)]
*  Families on bicycles, people that just heard about it, that were streaming it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=158.4s)]
*  And I think that's a kind of grassroots attention we're seeing across the country. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=163.4s)]
*  I think early on, people were shocked by what was going on. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=167.4s)]
*  They were, of course, saddened. They still are. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=170.4s)]
*  But what matters now is people are turning out in droves. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=173.4s)]
*  You saw it in the Supreme Court race in Wisconsin, where the nominee, the Democratic nominee, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=176.4s)]
*  beat the Republican in 10 different counties. That Trump had won. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=185.4s)]
*  So this isn't just poll numbers. It is 100 days, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=191.4s)]
*  which are just the worst poll numbers we've seen in any president since polling began in the first 100 days. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=194.4s)]
*  37 percent of Americans don't only believe that he's handling the economy right. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=200.4s)]
*  Think about that. Those are not just the incredible activists that are turning out at these events or sitting on the steps. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=205.4s)]
*  This is also people who are quieter in rural areas, people who voted for them. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=212.4s)]
*  I know a bunch of them voted for Donald Trump and me. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=216.4s)]
*  They come up to me and tell me this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=219.4s)]
*  And they are not happy with what's going on because they don't like the chaos. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=221.4s)]
*  The chaos is up. Corruption is up. And yes, costs are up. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=225.4s)]
*  Ask anyone in the egg aisle. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=229.4s)]
*  You know, it strikes me that sometimes people say, you know, $1 trillion is a lot of money. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=231.4s)]
*  And it's like, oh my God, where are the cuts coming from? What does this mean? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=237.4s)]
*  And it means cuts to Medicaid. It means cuts to Medicare. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=239.4s)]
*  Like, these people are going to feel this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=243.4s)]
*  And you do tell that with what's happening with the tariffs. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=245.4s)]
*  And it doesn't seem that any relief is actually coming anytime soon. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=249.4s)]
*  And I was struck by what you said on the Capitol steps in rural areas. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=253.4s)]
*  And we were talking off camera. And I'm like, what do people farm in Minnesota? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=257.4s)]
*  Because, you know, I'm from Nebraska. And you said they do everything. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=261.4s)]
*  And the soybeans are a key part of it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=263.4s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=265.4s)]
*  I am thinking about if the farmers can't sell their soybeans, what does that mean for the people that they employ, not just those farmers? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=266.4s)]
*  What does it mean for the restaurants? They can't import the— [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=273.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=275.4s)]
*  What is really— [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=276.4s)]
*  Grocery stores, small grocery stores. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=277.4s)]
*  What's the impact really going to be? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=278.4s)]
*  So, let's just look at this perfect storm that's happening right now. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=279.4s)]
*  You already have grocery prices up in his first 100 days. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=282.4s)]
*  You already have many of these social security—the very big concern of our seniors. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=285.4s)]
*  They call in. No one's answering. They're closing down 47 offices. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=292.4s)]
*  The budget, as you just pointed out, Simone, with Medicaid, there's no other way, the Congressional Budget Office said, to make these cuts, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=295.4s)]
*  except on the back of people who are in nursing homes. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=303.4s)]
*  When you've got—in my state, half of the people in nursing homes are on Medicaid, even higher nationally. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=306.4s)]
*  You look at that, and then you combine it with this economic assault. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=311.4s)]
*  And this is going to hit rural Americans like you've never seen, because they tend to be older. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=315.4s)]
*  They're farmers. They're living on smaller margins. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=321.4s)]
*  And when you start messing around with their markets, 20 percent of what our farmers produce in the U.S. is exported. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=324.4s)]
*  And when they start getting the retaliatory tariffs, or no one wants to buy their soybeans, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=331.4s)]
*  being in China, because they can buy them from Brazil very easily, you're going to devastate that farm economy. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=336.4s)]
*  And what really bothers me, as someone that cares about antitrust, is that the big guys—you know, Tim Cook and I, you know, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=342.4s)]
*  glad that he saved Apple, but he can walk in there and get an exemption for Apple. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=349.4s)]
*  Or you've got these big investors that show up with the Treasury Secretary at a closed-door meeting [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=354.4s)]
*  with a bank and with investors. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=360.4s)]
*  My small businesswoman of the year that runs Busy Baby out of southern Minnesota—check it out, little stuff for the high chairs— [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=363.4s)]
*  she didn't get invited to the White House or the investment banker thing at J.B. Morgan. She didn't get invited. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=372.4s)]
*  So you have this—the people who are going to be the roadkill are the consumers. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=378.4s)]
*  It's the people that don't have the safety net. It's the smallest businesses. It's the small farmers. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=383.4s)]
*  And that's what you're already starting to see happen. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=388.4s)]
*  Yes, it matters for the biggest stuff and the economy, but it's really going to hurt the small people first. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=391.4s)]
*  The small folks. And we're almost out of time, but I have to wonder. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=397.4s)]
*  I'm concerned about the potential for nefarious activity around the elections in 26—not just in 2028, but 26 specifically, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=400.4s)]
*  given what we are already seeing happen. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=412.4s)]
*  You are a former prosecutor. Are you concerned about what the Republicans might try to do to ensure they win elections? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=414.4s)]
*  Of course. You've got a president there that has repeatedly denied the results of the election. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=422.4s)]
*  He actually just recently said he was going to—Chris Krebs should be investigated, who is the guy who works for him, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=429.4s)]
*  who had the audacity to say that the elections were safe, just like his attorney general at the time, Bill Bard did. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=435.4s)]
*  So you've got that as the backdrop. And then you have the fact, as we've learned in the last few days, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=441.4s)]
*  that they have decimated the leadership in the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=446.4s)]
*  and that people are leaving, and you just won't have the will to enforce those laws. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=452.4s)]
*  And I'm thinking not just on the actual voting, which I hope will hold, because the states often control the mechanisms for voting, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=458.4s)]
*  but you've got the enforcement of the voting laws. Even the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision in 2023, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=466.4s)]
*  this same Supreme Court voted against racial gerrymandering on a 5-4 vote, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=473.4s)]
*  and that was a case that was supported by—not brought by, but supported by Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=479.4s)]
*  They bring these cases. That's their job, to make sure that the law is enforced. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=486.4s)]
*  So, of course, this is a major concern when you look at who works in the Civil Rights Division [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=490.4s)]
*  and the kind of important work they have to do when it comes to elections. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=495.4s)]
*  Or who used to work there, because now they're all gone. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=499.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPrOUvwP_I&t=520.4s)]
