# GOP bill would protect AI companies from lawsuits if they offer transparency
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY)
*  I want to go back to a story we mentioned earlier. Senator Rand Paul says he was uninvited to a White [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=0.0s)]
*  House picnic for members of Congress and their families set to take place later today. The reason? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=4.72s)]
*  The Kentucky Republican says it's retribution for his opposition to the budget mega bill, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=9.84s)]
*  the president's tariffs and other Trump policies that he has quite publicly disagreed with. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=14.16s)]
*  Every Democrat will be invited. Every Republican will be invited, but I will be the only one [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  disallowed to come on the grounds of the White House. I just find this incredibly petty. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=24.48s)]
*  I mean, I have been, I think, nothing but polite to the president. I have been a intellectual [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=30.0s)]
*  opponent, a public policy opponent, and he's chosen now to uninvite me from the picnic [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=37.12s)]
*  and to say my grandson can't come to the picnic. I just, just the level of immaturity is beyond words. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=42.8s)]
*  I don't know, it's just incredibly petty and it shows it. Look, I'm arguing from a true belief [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=52.32s)]
*  and worry that our country is mired in debt and getting worse and they choose to react by [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=57.44s)]
*  uninviting my grandson to the picnic. I don't know, I just think it really makes me lose a lot of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=63.44s)]
*  respect I once had for Donald Trump. Oof. And joining us now, Democratic Congresswoman April [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  McLean Delaney of Maryland. She's the chair of the New Democrat Coalition Rural Broadband Task Force [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=75.6s)]
*  and this is actually taking a central role here, right? Because as we talk about the ways that the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=81.52s)]
*  Senate could change this reconciliation package, there has become a new focus on this AI moratorium [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=85.76s)]
*  piece and that's exactly what you're zeroing in on here. So for viewers who may not have read the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=92.4s)]
*  1100-page bill, including some Republicans apparently, talk to us about what this is and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=97.12s)]
*  why you're concerned about it. Well, I'm concerned about this bill for a multitude of reasons and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  the way in which, you know, how you spend money is really how you prioritize your American values, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=105.76s)]
*  right? But most importantly, in addition to all the senseless cuts across the board which impact [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=110.72s)]
*  the 6th District of Maryland where I am, I've spent a lifetime as a child online advocate and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=116.24s)]
*  worked in the administration, in the Biden administration at NTIA ruling out broadband, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=122.88s)]
*  closing the digital divide, and unfortunately they have placed, kind of snuck into this reconciliation [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=127.28s)]
*  a budget package that is putting a moratorium on AI regulation by the states and if they, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=133.76000000000002s)]
*  for 10 years, and if they decide to regulate, they don't get BID funding, which is the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=141.44s)]
*  infrastructure, bipartisan infrastructure broadband funding needed by the states to close the digital [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=146.4s)]
*  divide. And you know that broadband funding is like a utility. I mean, you know, like electricity [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=152.24s)]
*  or water, you really can't thrive in our, you know, our economy and online learning with our [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=158.08s)]
*  kids unless you have broadband. Well, I've even talked to some more rural areas. I was reporting [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=163.84s)]
*  a story about Next Generation 911 and the ability to text if you need emergency help and rural [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  broadband is one of the things that's an important and essential layer for areas that are trying to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  expand just their basic emergency services. So just to hammer this home for folks. And that is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  really important. I worked at NG911, well, at NTIA and public emergency services, you know, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=184.24s)]
*  geolocation services and broadband and really universal broadband, high speed, affordable, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=189.52s)]
*  accessible broadband is key for everything we do. And if we don't have it and if we actually [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  weaponize, you know, infrastructure funding, which has been pre-approved, passed by Congress, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  this is pre-appropriated funding and clawing that back and really kind of in a coercive policy [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=206.4s)]
*  trying to get a force and ram through AI legislation. And listen, artificial intelligence [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=212.96s)]
*  is here. It is a global race to get ahead. But it's really important we have bumpers and safeguards [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  with respect to ethical and safe use and do no harm. And it is really important that we have [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=225.12s)]
*  a standalone comprehensive bill that looks at all facets of it. And really, I mean, just two days [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=230.56s)]
*  ago I was in the Ag Committee and we looked at how do we regulate, you know, digital assets, crypto. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=237.12s)]
*  But really, and there's really great things to do in precision agriculture and different things, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=243.6s)]
*  but you need broadband to be able to even, you know, help with all of these 21st century [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=248.8s)]
*  innovations. And so within this package, we are basically saying to states, if it passed right [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=254.24s)]
*  now, that if they take money to expand rural broadband, they will not be able to regulate [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=257.92s)]
*  against AI for a set number of years. We've seen how quickly AI moves. Ten years. Ten years. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=262.32s)]
*  We've seen how quickly AI moves even just in a year or two. What's the impact? In a month or two. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=267.68s)]
*  So what's the impact then of saying you can't touch this stuff for a few years? What's the impact on [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=273.52s)]
*  kids that you've worked with, for example? Well, I think the problem is, is you, you know, I've been [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=278.4s)]
*  trying to get comprehensive privacy for kids for over a decade. I worked at Common Sense Media. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=283.2s)]
*  And so if, you know, we have not been able to pass a lot of these protections with respect to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=288.4s)]
*  social media, so much less, you know, think about virtual reality and AI in such a bigger and broader [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  way. And it's not only just online safety, which I've been working on my whole life, but it's also [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=299.28s)]
*  consumer fraud, deep fakes. I mean, thinking about, you know, it's, it's an amplification effect in so [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  many different ways. And really, there's also a lot of surveillance issues that I worry about, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=310.56s)]
*  in addition to the ability to kind of, you know, kind of how we are, the algorithms are used really [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=316.32s)]
*  to guide us. Yeah, I do think it's really important. Congress had an opportunity here with the rise of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=324.64s)]
*  AI to get in on the ground floor with regulations. And we're watching them now potentially push that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=330.24s)]
*  opportunity away. Democratic Congresswoman, April McLean Delaney of Maryland. It's a really important [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=335.36s)]
*  issue. I'd like to have you back to talk more about it. Thank you for having me. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu49v-G25kY&t=340.88s)]
