# 'Vladimir, STOP!' Trump reacts to new Russian strikes on Ukraine
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU)
*  Joining us now NBC News International reporter Matt Bodner and USA Today Washington bureau chief Susan Page. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=0.0s)]
*  Matt, what can you tell us about these attacks overnight coming just hours after President Trump said he believed he had struck a deal with Russia? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=6.7s)]
*  Well, the first thing I would say on is that this is not the first time that Russia's conducted a devastating strike on civilian areas while paying lip service to the peace process. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  This latest attack was a mixed strike using drones and missiles. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  It killed at least 13 people in Kiev. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=26.9s)]
*  It also injured more than 70. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=28.8s)]
*  It's also worth mentioning here that two weeks ago Russia launched a ballistic missile salvo against the Ukrainian city of Sumi took place on Palm Sunday and it killed 35 people and injured 129 among them were children. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=30.7s)]
*  But going back to this latest strike, it of course comes after senior US officials involved in the negotiation efforts that would be Mark Rubio, Mark Rubio, sorry, Steve Wittkopf skips high level meetings here in London yesterday. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=43.2s)]
*  And Trump publicly railed against Zelensky for being the obstacle as Trump sees it to ending this war. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=55.2s)]
*  And so it is noteworthy that last night's attack provoked a direct rebuke against Vladimir Putin by President Trump on Truth Social. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=60.1s)]
*  And he said he's not happy with these Russian strikes on Kiev. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=68.2s)]
*  They're not necessary. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=70.9s)]
*  And as you said, Vladimir, stop. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=71.9s)]
*  And so Matt, just coming back to what you mentioned, how the president was slamming Vladimir or Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday, accusing him of harming the peace talks over his refusal to surrender Crimea as US officials had proposed the conditions of what the US is proposing in these peace talks said to be very favorable for Russia. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=74.39999999999999s)]
*  What more can you tell us about the US demands? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=93.7s)]
*  Well, we've been hearing that the major impasse in the negotiations now concerns this idea of recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=97.3s)]
*  And I think it's been clear to the Ukrainians for some time now that they're not going to be getting occupied territories back as part of this specific process. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=104.6s)]
*  Zelensky himself has said this several times since Trump took office that they're really looking towards diplomacy to reclaim the occupied territories. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=112.9s)]
*  That all said, recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, that is a bitter pill to swallow not just for Zelensky, but for much of the Ukrainian public. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=120.3s)]
*  That 2014 annexation of Crimea, it's really one of the key symbols of Russia's efforts to subjugate Ukraine. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=128.7s)]
*  And the big war, as Ukrainians call the events of the last three years, has only solidified these attitudes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=136.1s)]
*  Susan, it is hard to imagine these terms even being an option for Ukraine and for Zelensky. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=142.5s)]
*  What do you make of how the Trump administration is approaching this, essentially giving this ultimatum, take the deal or the US is out? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=147.3s)]
*  I think this course was set on Election Day in November. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump has been a big skeptic, a critic of US, their US role in the war in Ukraine. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=161.10000000000002s)]
*  He has taken a much, a famously friendlier attitude toward Vladimir Putin and a very critical one toward Zelensky. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=167.9s)]
*  And he also has this America first foreign policy that does not embrace the idea of the United States engaging in military action to help other countries. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=175.7s)]
*  And so I think it is distressing to Ukraine and to those who want the US to continue to play a big role in things like the Western Alliance in Europe. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=185.5s)]
*  But this is no surprise. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=197.5s)]
*  And of course, the clock is ticking. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=200.1s)]
*  President Trump said he could settle this war on day one. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=203.1s)]
*  That hasn't happened. If he doesn't settle it on some kind of terms in his first 100 days, it seems likely that the White House will do what they call move on. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, President Trump has said multiple times now that Zelensky has no cards to play. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=215.1s)]
*  But the Wall Street Journal editorial board argues that he does have one ace writing the president won't be able to abandon Ukraine without paying a heavy political price. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=220.3s)]
*  They quote a historian who recently said Americans hate war, but they hate losing a war even more. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  Susan, do you agree that it would be politically risky for President Trump to walk away? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=237.5s)]
*  You know, the big risk, political risk for President Trump these days is the economy, not the war in Ukraine. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=243.70000000000002s)]
*  And as important as it is, Americans tend to judge presidents by how they affect their own personal lives, the issues that they face around a kitchen table. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=248.7s)]
*  So I do think there is a lower political risk, fairly or not, on Ukraine than there is, say, on the stock market and the whole tariffs war that we also see heating up. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=259.7s)]
*  Susan Page and Matt Bodner, appreciate you both. Thank you so much for the discussion. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=270.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP-_RA4hchU&t=278.7s)]
