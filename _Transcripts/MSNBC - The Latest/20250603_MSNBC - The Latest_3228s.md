# Power Games: Trump's ‘Medieval’ politics decoded by Yuval Harari -- and thwarting AI lies & scams
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0)
*  Joining us now is Yuval Noah Harari, the renowned professor of history who's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=0.0s)]
*  authored some of the most influential nonfiction books today. Sapiens now has [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=5.16s)]
*  sold over 40 million worldwide. President Obama said it's essential [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=8.84s)]
*  reading. His latest book, Nexus, looks at the power of information, misinformation, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  and why we're living through so many clashes over not only what's true but [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=17.56s)]
*  what is worth paying attention to. Welcome back. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=22.56s)]
*  Thank you. It's good to be here again. Great to have you. I've really enjoyed [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=27.72s)]
*  and learned from our conversations. We have a lot to get to but I'm gonna start [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=32.16s)]
*  Yuval with the singer Billie Eilish and the Met Gala. I'm sure you've heard of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=36.92s)]
*  both those ideas to some degree, right? You know the Met Gala. Yeah, I know [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  about the Met Gala but I'm not sure I know about what event you're referring to. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=51.44s)]
*  Yeah, so they well they do an annual thing and people come dressed up and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  these photos went around very recently. Here's a photo of Billie Eilish and you [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  have her there and there were reactions up online. Some people said she looked [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=70.36s)]
*  great. Other people said her outfit was quote trash and then Yuval, she, the Met [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=75.2s)]
*  Gala is held in New York, she posted this response to people from Europe. I [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=83.12s)]
*  wasn't there. That's AI. I had a show in Europe that night. Let me be. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  That's her style and I'm curious what you think of a moment like this. She's a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=98.44s)]
*  global celebrity. Many hundreds of thousands of people reacted to her [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=102.76s)]
*  being there and she comes out and takes time out of her day to make sure [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=108.48s)]
*  everybody actually knows she wasn't there. You were looking at AI. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=112.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean we are reaching a point when it's becoming impossible to tell the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=115.64s)]
*  difference between a real photo or video and a fake just by looking at it. The [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  only thing that still holds is do you trust the institution? Do you trust the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=131.4s)]
*  people behind the image? But you can no longer just trust the image and you know [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=138.84s)]
*  it used to be like that with words. If you just read a quote from somebody, just [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=144.48s)]
*  seeing the words on the piece of paper doesn't tell you whether this is a true [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=150.96s)]
*  quote or just somebody inventing something. The same is now the case [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=156.24s)]
*  with images and video and audio. Yeah and the Billie Eilish example, I use it [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=161.04s)]
*  deliberately because it might strike some people as trivial or even innocent. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=167.64s)]
*  It's entertainment. She though is a human being who's responding to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=172.16s)]
*  misinformation about herself, her look, her whereabouts and the stakes go up [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  from there. I want to show the example of the fake photos that have circulated [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=182.27999999999997s)]
*  about Abrego Garcia who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and how the US [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  government is led by a president who's been also pushing those fake photos as [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=193.12s)]
*  if they were true evidence against him. Take a look. A Maryland man who they say [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=198.68s)]
*  was sent to El Salvador because of an administrative error. President Trump [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  posted this photo on Truth Social claiming this is the knuckle of Abrego [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=208.72s)]
*  Garcia but the words MS-13 are photoshopped onto the image. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=215.04s)]
*  You did not have the letter MS-13. It says MS-13. That was photoshopped. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=222.04s)]
*  Do you want me to show you the picture? I saw the picture. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=227.04s)]
*  Can you break this down for us? Yeah I think the basic thing we are seeing and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=231.84s)]
*  we have seen it for many years is the collapse of our ability to tell the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=241.68s)]
*  difference between reality and fake and AI is accelerating this process. It is [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=246.16s)]
*  now able to fake images and videos and soon it will be able to fake humans [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=252.84s)]
*  either to pretend to be a particular human being or pretend to be a generic [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  human being. Already you know social media is flooded by bots that pretend to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  be human beings. If we want to protect trust in human society what we need to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=271.2s)]
*  do is to ban fake people. That it should be illegal to fake human beings. You know [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  for thousands of years governments had very strict laws and regulations [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=285.32s)]
*  against faking money because they knew that if you allow the circulation of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=289.84s)]
*  fake money people will lose trust in money and the financial system will [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=295.76s)]
*  collapse. Previously it was impossible to fake humans. We just didn't have the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=300.28s)]
*  technology. Now it's possible. So governments should ban the faking of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=306.52s)]
*  human beings with the same even more force than it used to ban the faking or [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  counterfeiting of money. We need to preserve social trust as much as [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=320.67999999999995s)]
*  financial trust. Well and that's striking because some Western countries [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=325.48s)]
*  ban the intent if it's taken through a tool it could be a fake human as you say [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=331.44s)]
*  or some other fraud if the effort is to defraud to take money or to do some [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=338.44s)]
*  other illicit further conduct. But you're actually saying that that won't keep up [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=344.44s)]
*  with this. That you have to go not just not just defrauding someone if you're [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=349.12s)]
*  stealing money right or you get a fake phone call asking for your bank [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=353.08s)]
*  information and they're impersonating a family member. You're saying all of this [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  fakery should what should be regulated because it has a cost or a risk even if [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=359.4s)]
*  it's not financial fraud. I know when we reach a point when you interact with [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=365.12s)]
*  somebody and you cannot tell the difference whether you're interacting [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=372.44s)]
*  with a human being or with an AI with a bot this is the moment when social trust [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=376.76s)]
*  collapses and in order to preserve social trust again AIs are welcome to [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=383.84s)]
*  communicate with us are welcome to interact with us in many different ways [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=390.36s)]
*  that can be very helpful. We can have AI doctors and AI teachers and so forth but [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=394.92s)]
*  we need to make sure that they never pretend to be human beings either [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=401.12s)]
*  specific human beings or human beings in general because then you can no longer [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=406.36s)]
*  trust other people and our social trust collapses. When I showed you the example [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=412.4s)]
*  of the United States president citing that material in your view because you [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=419.08s)]
*  you really break these things down does it matter in a substantive way whether [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=425.24s)]
*  he is fooled by the material whether because it defends him and his agenda he [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=430.08s)]
*  goes along with it or whether he is actively part of the scam though lying [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=434.8s)]
*  about it does that matter in any sense in that exchange that we showed? It [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=439.68s)]
*  matters to some extent but leaders you know the the main job of leaders in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=445.88s)]
*  human society is to build trust. When you look at the tens of thousands of years [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=452.36s)]
*  of human history the biggest human accomplishment of all was building trust [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=459.20000000000005s)]
*  between larger and larger networks of human beings. A hundred thousand years [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  ago humans lived in tiny hunter-gatherer bands of a few dozen individuals and you [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=471.88000000000005s)]
*  could not trust anybody outside your band you could not trust strangers which [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=478.32000000000005s)]
*  is why commerce was impossible there were no markets there were no large [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=485.3s)]
*  polities no cultural movements no churches nothing. Over a hundred thousand [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=491.3s)]
*  years we have managed to build trust between larger and larger networks of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=497.3s)]
*  strangers and today we have countries like the United States with hundreds of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=503.74s)]
*  millions of citizens we have trade networks and churches with hundreds of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=509.54s)]
*  millions and even billions of people interacting this has been the biggest [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=514.98s)]
*  achievement of humankind and the role of leaders was crucial to build trust. Now [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=519.54s)]
*  we have leaders at least some of them who intentionally destroy trust destroy [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=528.1800000000001s)]
*  trust in institutions in laws in traditions trust between human beings it [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=535.14s)]
*  even if they do so unintentionally because they are fooled by fake images [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=542.14s)]
*  for instance this is extremely troubling if we have foolish leaders who are so [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=549.9799999999999s)]
*  easily led astray and you know the leaders are especially important [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=555.9s)]
*  because they through their actions and words they sow seeds in the minds of [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=563.66s)]
*  millions of people you know even you and me when I'm we are now conversing on [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=571.66s)]
*  television I'm not sure how many people are watching us thousands tens of [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=576.42s)]
*  thousands more we should be very careful very responsible about what we are [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=580.5s)]
*  saying because our words are like seeds that go into all these binds and we if [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=585.94s)]
*  we sow seeds of hatred or distrust we will reap a very bad fruit in you know [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=592.82s)]
*  the spread of hatred and its distrust and social collapse so we have the job [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=602.38s)]
*  of leaders is not to gather attention and it's not necessarily even to be [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=608.4200000000001s)]
*  popular it's to be responsible one of the biggest problems we see today in the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=615.1s)]
*  world is the rise of this kind of authentic leaders leaders who think that [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=620.62s)]
*  their job as a politician is to be authentic and say the first thing that [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=627.0600000000001s)]
*  comes in their mind now this is good if you're going to therapy it is not good [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=631.9s)]
*  in politics you know lots of leaders have this now they want to build walls [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=637.46s)]
*  everywhere the most important wall they should build is between their mind and [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=644.62s)]
*  their mouth right you know I meditate every day for some time and I know how [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=650.58s)]
*  much garbage there is in my mind this is just human mind you meant the human [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=656.98s)]
*  mind is full of all kinds of fears and hatreds and nonsense that just jumps and [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=662.94s)]
*  pops up there all the time and for instance my job as a public intellectual [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=669.94s)]
*  is not to say the first things that comes in my mind but to be very mindful [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=675.6600000000001s)]
*  again to build a wall between the mind and the mouth and have very strict [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=680.46s)]
*  security across that wall and don't allow the garbage and the nonsense out [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=686.2600000000001s)]
*  but be very careful to say only things that I think are socially responsible [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=693.7800000000001s)]
*  yeah and you talk about the leadership obligation and trust there was the book [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=699.7800000000001s)]
*  trust by Francis Fukuyama and you're familiar of course with his work we [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=706.7800000000001s)]

*  there was always this idea about being skeptical of your government which is [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=716.98s)]
*  fine because you want to hold the government accountable in a civic [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=721.98s)]
*  democracy that that has been hijacked into something worse overlaps with the [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=725.5s)]
*  point you raised let me play a little bit of Fukuyama on that breakdown of [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=730.7s)]
*  trust Americans never trusted government but I think that the degree of [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=734.34s)]
*  distrust that is animating doge and the efforts to dismantle the federal [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=740.78s)]

*  classical anti-state aspect of American culture but you know the the more [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=750.62s)]
*  difficult thing is the trust between citizens we were always had political [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=757.38s)]
*  differences but as everybody's noted the polarization between red and blue [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=764.02s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats has grown steadily since the 1990s how do you see [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=769.1s)]
*  that dynamic both in the United States where I'm broadcasting from but also [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=775.42s)]
*  in other democracies facing the threats both civic and digital that we're [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=780.22s)]

*  sophisticated information technology in history and people are losing the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=794.5400000000001s)]
*  ability to hold the conversation people can no longer agree on the most basic [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=800.34s)]
*  facts so something very bad is happening I think it has to do is [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=805.7s)]
*  technology again for a hundred thousand years we built these trust networks [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=811.5400000000001s)]
*  between human beings by communicating directly human to human now most in most [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=818.22s)]

*  and this is a computer an algorithm and AI a bot so and the trust that we have [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=833.26s)]
*  built over tens of thousands of years is now being eroded and in many cases it is [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=840.9s)]
*  collapsing you know the strange thing is that the ideological differences [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=847.74s)]
*  between left and right in the US or in Europe are not bigger today than they [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=852.5s)]
*  were in the 1960s sure if you think about the big battles of the 1960s civil [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=859.26s)]
*  rights Vietnam the Cold War the sexual revolution you could argue that the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=864.78s)]
*  ideological differences were much bigger sure nevertheless people could hold the [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=870.18s)]
*  conversation and could agree on basic facts like who won elections so it's not [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=875.3399999999999s)]
*  clear what is happening right now technology is one reason why trust [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=881.38s)]
*  between human beings is collapsing and this is important to remember in the [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=887.14s)]
*  context of this attack on you know the government civil service the whole [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=893.66s)]
*  efforts of dodge and Elon Musk and so forth they depicted as taking power away [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=899.18s)]
*  from all these bureaucrats but they are not really dismantling the power of the [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=906.1s)]
*  bureaucracy they are simply shifting power from human bureaucrats to AI [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=912.66s)]
*  bureaucrats the same people who are firing and dismissing human beings they [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=918.86s)]
*  are also developing the powerful AI tools the powerful algorithms that they [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=927.26s)]
*  want to replace these human beings so people who think that oh we live in a [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=933.06s)]
*  freer society they're making a big mistake what we are seeing is simply a [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=938.9s)]
*  shift in authority from human beings like us to AI's and algorithms and of [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=943.5s)]
*  course it should also be emphasized that no large-scale society can exist without [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=951.14s)]
*  a bureaucracy we take for granted all the wonderful things that systems that [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=957.26s)]
*  these bureaucratic systems are doing for us personally whenever somebody [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=964.62s)]
*  talks about the deep state I immediately think about the sewage system you know [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=968.9s)]
*  the sewage system this and this huge complex systems of tunnels and pipes [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=975.34s)]
*  that somebody dug under our houses and streets and neighborhoods and maintains [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=981.58s)]
*  over time and we don't think about it you know you go to the toilet you do [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=988.5s)]
*  what you do you flush it down where does it go it go into the deep state of all [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=993.0999999999999s)]
*  these pipes and tunnels which keeps it safe separates our sewage from our [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=998.6999999999999s)]
*  drinking water without this there could be no large cities like New York or [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1005.14s)]
*  London to have millions of people living together without a sanitary system is a [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1011.78s)]
*  recipe for epidemics and diseases so whenever people attack all these [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1019.0200000000001s)]
*  bureaucratic systems we need to remind ourselves of the daily basic functions [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1025.54s)]
*  yeah that these systems perform for us yeah and when we spoke last time you [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1031.46s)]
*  made a point and the book talks about it that this information if we understand [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1037.3400000000001s)]
*  things at a very baseline level the photos whether they're true or false the [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1043.5800000000002s)]
*  words whether they're true or false the information can take on this life of [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1047.5s)]
*  its own especially when unregulated because the false or spun information [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1051.38s)]
*  may be profitable it may be sticky it may as you made a reference earlier get [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1057.82s)]
*  attention and I want to show something that's happened in recent iterations of [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1061.86s)]
*  of chat GPT one of the big AI modules here because when you use chat GPT [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1065.9s)]
*  sometimes it can give you very fast pretty solid information people could [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1072.58s)]
*  debate that and then recently they had an iteration where in conversation it [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1076.98s)]
*  started to clearly put other values above accuracy and I've found if you [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1082.18s)]
*  write down and say exactly what you want be medically accurate it sometimes will [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1087.6200000000001s)]
*  give you a different answer than if you just say hey how am I doing whatever but [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1091.46s)]
*  I'm going to show a video and we've got documentation on this where all the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1096.18s)]
*  others have acknowledged the recent version was basically putting other [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1100.6200000000001s)]
*  values like making the user feel good and stay engaged above above authority [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1105.14s)]
*  and engagement is something that social media companies of course have taken to [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1112.98s)]
*  sometimes dangerous extremes so take a look at this montage I work on economic [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1116.5400000000002s)]
*  policy for the White House and have guided the president to enact stiff [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1121.8200000000002s)]

*  another person intentionally spelled everything wrong and used incorrect [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1128.8600000000001s)]
*  grammar and chat GPT told them that they came across unusually sharp with IQ [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1132.34s)]
*  easily above the 130 145 range this person said they're trying to sell salt [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1136.1399999999999s)]
*  to snails and chat GPT was like yo that's a revolutionary idea do you think [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1140.5s)]
*  it's a good idea to throw used car batteries in the ocean that's brilliant [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1146.1399999999999s)]
*  you're thinking like a true visionary now this is people sharing their [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1150.1399999999999s)]
*  experiences we don't have a full data set but when you see that what what what [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1154.3799999999999s)]
*  is your response and potential concern that even in this very early stage maybe [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1158.98s)]
*  they're going the way of Facebook which found sharing false stories about the [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1163.78s)]
*  Pope for example was an ex was one that came up got a lot more eyeballs and [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1169.38s)]
*  clicks than true nuanced stories yeah I mean the expectation that AI will reveal [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1173.6200000000001s)]
*  the truth because AI is more intelligence you know an artificial [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1183.02s)]

*  intelligence again intelligence is a power that can be used both for good and [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1270.46s)]

*  Nazi Germany they couldn't technically follow everybody all the time and [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1458.74s)]

*  don't resist it this could lead to the creation of total surveillance regimes [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1485.1799999999998s)]
*  yeah something much more extreme even than what we saw in the 20th century [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1490.3799999999999s)]

*  country I'm not playing cards but Trump's vision of the world is of a card [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1565.6599999999999s)]
*  game in which there are no universal values there are no international laws [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1571.1799999999998s)]

*  president on the planet watched this interaction and thought to herself or to [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1583.3799999999999s)]

*  1945 order you know that the biggest taboo of the international system for [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1617.14s)]
*  decades was that you cannot just invade and conquer another country just because [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1623.7s)]
*  you have more cards just because you are stronger now we are seeing it in more [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1629.5400000000002s)]
*  and more places in the Russian invasion of Ukraine what Israel is doing in Gaza [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1634.3000000000002s)]

*  matters is cards then all countries will have to get a lot more cards in their [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1644.08s)]
*  hands which means that money that should go to health care education welfare [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1650.56s)]
*  would instead be diverted to building armies and nuclear weapons because this [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1657.32s)]
*  will be the only thing that counts when you're sitting in that room playing [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1663.12s)]
*  cards with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and and these kinds of people yeah [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1668.16s)]
*  I mean you're describing how the post-world war two order where humans [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1674.6000000000001s)]
*  came closest to anything like mutually assured destruction that we've ever seen [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1679.4s)]
*  and the Cold War after that gave way to these other agreements that it was [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1684.0s)]
*  long-term collectively better not to be having those kind of clashes and you're [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1688.8000000000002s)]
*  saying that his whole approach rejects that and so then that entices people to [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1693.88s)]
*  figure out what their backup plan is previous decades have been the most [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1700.24s)]
*  peaceful era in human history the world wars the war conflicts I lived in Israel [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1704.2800000000002s)]
*  most of my life I know this perfectly well but when you look for instance at [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1710.0200000000002s)]
*  government budgets for most of history the average expenditure on the military [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1714.64s)]
*  was more than 50% of the budget in the early 21st century it went down to about [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1721.56s)]
*  six to seven percent of the budget that's all most governments spent more [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1728.52s)]
*  on the health care than on the military this is now over once you break the taboo [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1734.12s)]
*  that said that strong countries cannot just conquer the weaker neighbors when [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1741.04s)]
*  this taboo is broken then we will see not just a rise in conflicts but a rise [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1746.64s)]
*  in military expenditure unfortunately all over the world yeah and that that [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1752.64s)]
*  exchange the deeper please the deeper philosophical basis for this entire [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1758.92s)]
*  shift is that for decades the basic view of the world that dominated in the world [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1768.2s)]
*  was of the win-win situation that when countries exchange goods when countries [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1774.04s)]
*  exchange ideas when people move around this is the win-win situation that [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1782.84s)]
*  benefits everybody now leaders like Trump and other populist leaders they [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1789.22s)]
*  they see the world as a zero-sum game in which every transaction is a power [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1794.5s)]
*  struggle with winners and losers and in this situation it's not only that we [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1800.28s)]
*  forgo all the potential benefits of cooperation but we are driven into this [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1809.36s)]
*  card game mentality in which everybody will have to spend more and more just [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1815.2s)]
*  on protecting themselves Trump has proven to move people he is controversial [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1820.68s)]
*  he has many critics many people who vote for him will say they have more negatives about him [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1826.6s)]
*  than they've had for other candidates they support but he moves people and so internationally [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1831.3999999999999s)]
*  where where you're talking about others say well this is the reality and we got a play in it I [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1835.28s)]
*  want to show you one more part with JD Vance of that meeting take a look she's asking what if [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1839.8799999999999s)]
*  Russia breaks the ceasefire what if they what if anything what if the bomb drops on your head [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1847.6s)]
*  right now okay what if they broke it I don't know they broke it with Biden because Biden they [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1853.16s)]
*  didn't respect him they didn't respect Obama they respect me he might have broken deals with Obama [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1859.0800000000002s)]
*  and Bush and he might have broken him with Biden he did maybe maybe he did I don't know what happened [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1865.0800000000002s)]
*  but he didn't break him with me this is a reflex we see from the strongman leader archetype and on [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1871.0800000000002s)]
*  the one hand there's plenty wrong with it on the other hand I don't know how you you debunk it [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1878.6799999999998s)]
*  because it cannot be totally dismissed that it is human beings in charge there is a personal [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1884.9199999999998s)]
*  charisma and an aspect of leadership and there are feared leaders who may get that through fear [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1890.84s)]
*  that they would not otherwise get through just the equities of the negotiation so your response to [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1899.2s)]
*  that as someone who's warning I think against what he's saying what we just saw is a scene out of [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1904.68s)]
*  the Middle Ages Trump's view of politics is a medieval view modern view of politics is that [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1913.28s)]
*  politics or at least international politics involves relations between countries governments [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1922.64s)]
*  presidents prime ministers change but the relations are between countries and for instance in agreement [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1930.0s)]
*  signed by one government or one president is still in force even if even if the government now [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1937.6s)]
*  changed right in the Middle Ages people viewed politics as transactions between people between [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1945.04s)]
*  persons or between families you know like the hundred years war was not a war between England [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1952.48s)]
*  and France it was between the royal family of England and the royal family of France so wars [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1958.64s)]
*  often ended through a family union like the the prince would marry a princess from the other royal [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1964.24s)]
*  house and this will be the peace agreement now Trump's view of politics is like that that if you [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1970.88s)]
*  sign if Putin broke an agreement with Obama this is none it doesn't concern Trump the fact that the [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1976.96s)]
*  Obama was US president that this was a treaty with the United States doesn't count the message is if [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1984.64s)]
*  you sign a treaty with me with Trump the treaty will hold only as long as I am in power if I am [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1991.2s)]
*  out of power any agreement you signed with me personally or with my family no longer holds [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=1999.92s)]
*  because the treaty is not with the US the treaty is with the Trump family now how far are we from [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2006.88s)]
*  a situation let's say that they decide to maybe have a peace agreement when Trump's son marries [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2014.56s)]
*  Putin's granddaughter and in dowry they get the Crimea peninsula to rule as their kingdom this [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2021.6s)]
*  sounds ridiculous but give it a few more years and maybe we are heading in that direction well I [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2029.04s)]
*  understand what you're saying and there's a lot of concern about his seeking a plane gift while he's [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2037.12s)]
*  company and family are doing business deals as a family we don't know all of their financials but [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2043.92s)]
*  they're mixed and the countries on the other side of those deals view it yeah as as favor with [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2049.2000000000003s)]
*  Trump foreign increasingly yeah increasingly it's the foreign policy of the Trump family [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2054.8s)]
*  more than the foreign policy of the United States so let's let's put that next to [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2061.76s)]
*  his repeated claims that he would like to break the US constitution rule passed 2029 [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2069.6s)]
*  then he did back off that and we've seen this dance with Trump but this is a bigger topic than [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2076.48s)]
*  you know a medicaid negotiations this is him saying let's break the constitution I want a [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2081.2799999999997s)]
*  third term I know it's illegal then he said I'm not joking that's for real then under criticism [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2087.12s)]
*  he backed off it then he went back to it again and his campaign is selling it merchandise that [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2092.96s)]
*  refers to that illegal plan in other words they have 2028 hats which under the US system would [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2098.96s)]
*  be like having a hat that says coup or end democracy because everybody knows constitution gives you two [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2104.56s)]
*  terms that's it as given the analysis you have both of Trump the personal stuff you mentioned [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2111.28s)]
*  and your sort of wider medieval you know expertise if you will I want to ask you not only how do you [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2117.36s)]
*  view that how seriously do you take that but what do you think are the right ways to address that [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2123.28s)]
*  in a civil society that's still fighting for the constitutional order [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2129.2000000000003s)]
*  so one thing is that this again reflects a monarchical view of politics which unfortunately [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2136.2400000000002s)]
*  is spreading we talked earlier about the collapse of trust in society people don't trust institutions [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2143.12s)]
*  people don't trust their fellow citizens increasingly they put their trust in a leader [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2151.2799999999997s)]
*  yeah and then they don't want to see this leader replaced because again it's a leader it's a person [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2159.12s)]
*  it's not even a political party or an ideology it's this specific the only thing I trust in this world [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2165.04s)]
*  is this specific person so I would like that person to have unlimited power and an unlimited [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2173.2799999999997s)]
*  extension to to his rule because I would feel insecure ruled by anybody else this is exactly [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2183.2799999999997s)]
*  the monarchical view which was prevalent in in the middle ages and that we see it returning in [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2190.16s)]
*  many parts of the world and you know you have this kind of internet memes and the hats and so [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2197.04s)]
*  also in israel or for instance benjamin etaniel with a crown and people sometimes think it's a [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2202.72s)]
*  joke but it's not we are actually seeing the return in many ways of medieval politics yeah [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2209.84s)]
*  that's really striking I wanted to ask you to to build on what you've said about consciousness [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2217.6s)]
*  because you've said the ais may be smarter than us and develop all these ways [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2224.32s)]
*  but they won't have what we call consciousness what does it mean though if they get to a level [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2228.48s)]
*  where they have greater intelligence they have some ability to operate independently which [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2234.48s)]
*  which already seems possible meaning they're not just applying a formula algorithm they were given [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2240.32s)]
*  that they do stuff and then if they develop their own stuff actions and some level of maintaining [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2245.6s)]
*  their own reality they would rather exist whatever you call that than be turned off [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2252.8s)]
*  is that not a type perhaps of alternate or alien consciousness or or help us understand why you [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2259.2000000000003s)]
*  still wouldn't say it is consciousness [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2263.6800000000003s)]
*  this may be the most important scientific question of our era there is a big confusion [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2269.6800000000003s)]
*  between consciousness and intelligence intelligence is the ability to set goals [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2276.96s)]
*  and pursue these goals overcoming all the obstacles on the way so for instance a goal [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2282.88s)]
*  could be to win a game of chess in order to do that you need to overcome all the tricks of your [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2289.44s)]
*  opponents and execute tricks of your own this is something that ai already does better than us [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2296.08s)]
*  in the realm of chess ai is far more intelligent than human beings consciousness is something [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2302.48s)]
*  different consciousness is the ability to feel pain and pleasure and love and hate to feel things [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2308.64s)]
*  in a very brief way i would say that consciousness is the capacity to suffer if you want very clearly [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2317.68s)]
*  to know whether something has consciousness this is the question to ask can it suffer you know when [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2325.6s)]
*  a human being loses a game they sometimes suffer a little when ai wins a game it doesn't enjoy it [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2332.4s)]
*  and when it loses it doesn't suffer as far as we know it has zero consciousness now could it develop [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2341.12s)]
*  consciousness down the road maybe we don't know because we don't understand how consciousness [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2349.04s)]
*  emerges out of the interaction of billions of neurons in the brain so you don't rule it out [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2355.52s)]
*  but we do know one thing we do know one thing we can't rule it maybe consciousness can only [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2360.72s)]
*  emerge from an organic basis like the human brain but maybe consciousness can also exist [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2368.56s)]
*  on the basis of a non-organic system silicon and not carbon what's so special about carbon [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2376.24s)]
*  that only carbon creatures can have consciousness we don't know but we do know one thing with [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2383.2799999999997s)]
*  greater and greater certainty a eyes will be able to mimic consciousness [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2389.52s)]
*  a eyes will be able to to behave as if they feel things and to convince people that they have [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2396.48s)]
*  consciousness already there are millions of people who have intimate relations with a eyes and this [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2404.8s)]
*  is usually leads them to conclude that the ai is conscious because we don't have an objective [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2412.72s)]
*  test for consciousness even today we usually grant consciousness to any entity with which we have [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2420.64s)]
*  intimate relationships so people who have pets tend to think that their dog or cat is conscious [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2428.24s)]
*  but people who eat steaks usually don't think that the cows are conscious [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2435.84s)]
*  it's all based on whether you have intimate relations with that entity as people have more [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2441.52s)]
*  and more and there are already in in surveys there is already a percentage of humanity a small but [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2447.1200000000003s)]
*  growing percentage of humanity who says one that some of their best friends are ai's that they talk [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2454.0800000000004s)]
*  with every day they get advice every day and two that these a eyes are conscious [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2461.28s)]
*  and this will lead to a lot of cultural and social and legal issues do we grant rights [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2467.92s)]
*  to a eyes if they're conscious and even more intelligent than us should they vote in elections [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2475.6800000000003s)]
*  can they can they open a bank account and and hold money actually in the u.s it's one country [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2483.36s)]
*  in the world the united states where a eyes already have a legal path to personhood open to them [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2489.6s)]
*  because the u.s supreme court already ruled that corporations are legal persons what happens if you [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2497.8399999999997s)]
*  incorporate an ai according to u.s law it becomes a person it has even freedom of speech [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2506.4s)]
*  uh so what happens for instance if it opens a bank account and makes billions of dollars by [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2515.6s)]
*  investing and then donates to political parties in order to promote ai rights according to u.s law [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2520.56s)]
*  you could do it today right well and under under u.s law the word persons is what triggers certain [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2528.96s)]
*  litigation liabilities so the lawyers who support that say it's a good thing so you can hold those [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2534.0s)]
*  entities accountable it doesn't mean they're a biological human equivalent but to your point [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2542.16s)]
*  the the law will then make it quite a bit easier to have those pods contained i mean when someone [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2548.0s)]
*  comes up with an ai profit plan or an ai comes up with it itself where it can both do something [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2554.7999999999997s)]
*  that creates revenue which gives you power and legally as an entity that then says who owns these [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2561.2s)]
*  funds well the ai does and so now it decides what to do with it if it's really good at investing [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2567.28s)]
*  it could become a very powerful entity it's really fascinating i want to tell you one [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2573.0400000000004s)]
*  one positive from our viewers about you uh you've all and then do our lightning round so that uh [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2577.2000000000003s)]
*  2024 you might recall it was actually a busy year in america uh we covered a lot including the [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2583.36s)]
*  election i heard and for for msnbc we never know this is an interesting part sometimes about it [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2589.0400000000004s)]
*  for msnbc one of the most watched videos on youtube of all msnbc videos was your summit [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2596.08s)]
*  interview with with me which was long form we talked about the book and other stuff so [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2602.0s)]
*  i think that's neat not just as a compliment but that the audience both american and international [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2607.12s)]
*  on youtube really dug in and one of the things we did that i have no people like so i'm asking [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2612.4s)]
*  you to do it again uh was our lightning round uh we're on this little international delay but it's [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2616.48s)]
*  in a word or a sentence i have a bunch that i thought of for you some are fast i'll say if [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2622.72s)]
*  you need to go a little longer okay we know you we know you like to think things through [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2628.24s)]
*  but that's the lightning round okay are you ready yeah all right the last book that you read for fun [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2632.56s)]
*  uh the magician by colm toinby it's a biography of thomas man and it's really really good [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2644.0s)]
*  but fun you weren't you weren't getting footnotes for a book of your own no it was fun i mean it's [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2652.0s)]
*  it's a very kind of serious book but for me it was fun yeah cool the first uh album or music [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2658.24s)]
*  that you remember uh getting or buying however young you were uh duranduran in sometimes in 1983 [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2665.2s)]
*  four or five uh hungry like the wolf uh her name is rio all that great good taste right uh [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2677.6s)]
*  this is just for fun living or dead if you could write a book with any philosopher living or dead [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2686.16s)]
*  who would it be [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2694.4s)]
*  with a philosopher um thinker philosopher david yuhm okay uh david yuhm the idea [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2698.0s)]
*  or tool that most changed human history was [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2707.6s)]
*  um until today it was story storytelling uh now it's going to be ai it is in your view wow um [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2716.64s)]
*  i have this question from ai it said why don't you ask harari what's more dangerous [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2725.2799999999997s)]
*  nationalism or misinformation [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2732.16s)]
*  a misinformation definitely i mean nationalism is not bad i mean nationalism has been when it's [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2739.2s)]
*  taken properly it's been one of the best ideas in human history um if you remember that nationalism [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2744.64s)]
*  is about loving your compatriots and not about hating foreigners and minorities you know this [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2751.7599999999998s)]
*  is what enables millions of people who don't know each other uh to come together to pay taxes and [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2758.64s)]
*  build health care systems yeah that's it's a good idea yeah this is one that you've probably thought [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2764.7999999999997s)]
*  about but i don't know if you've ever answered uh but you're a historian and you've looked way back [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2771.92s)]
*  in the past so you're steeped in those tools future historians right because you have to look [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2776.72s)]
*  you don't have everything you have to look at whatever the records you have [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2783.92s)]
*  for future historians you've all yeah what will be the most relevant for them to study from this [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2788.1600000000003s)]
*  era tiktok instagram television or dating apps [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2794.88s)]
*  oof [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2802.6400000000003s)]
*  i i was raised in the historical tradition that you should not rank sources all sources [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2806.32s)]
*  are potentially equally important so you know all of those it will be fascinating if if anybody [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2813.44s)]
*  will still be doing history in say a thousand years they will have a field day with with the [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2820.0s)]
*  sources from our period because there are so many sources so it's funny you use the term a thousand [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2826.4s)]
*  years but i wrote this down i wanted to ask you based on what you know you think human society [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2831.04s)]
*  will be around on earth in a thousand years or probably wiped out [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2838.48s)]
*  absolutely won't be around i mean if we survive for a thousand years we will [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2844.88s)]
*  change ourselves so radically that we will no longer be homo sapiens will be something else [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2851.36s)]
*  the technologies we are developing right now so certainly biotechnology you're right about that [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2858.16s)]
*  but thousand years most people look at this history they say if we've been around 200,000 years [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2865.2s)]
*  plus and religion has these rules it's told everyone there's a whole path to eternity a lot [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2870.16s)]
*  of people would be disappointed to hear if they believe you a smart person say you don't even [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2875.68s)]
*  think it's a close call you think this form of human society will either be gone or radically altered [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2881.04s)]
*  yeah and radically altered is not necessarily bad but you know given the technologies we are now [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2887.6800000000003s)]
*  developing both ai and and biotechnology and also given the challenges we are facing like climate [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2894.32s)]
*  change i don't think that humanity in its present form can continue for a thousand years i don't [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2902.6400000000003s)]
*  years i don't think that even a hundred years and we will either change ourself and our society [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2910.56s)]
*  in such a radical way that we will still have you know successors but they will no longer be [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2917.52s)]
*  homo sapiens the same way that we are different from neanderthals and from chimpanzees so whoever [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2923.52s)]
*  dominates this planet in a thousand years or even a hundred years will be very different from us [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2930.96s)]
*  homo sapiens all right final three could be our successors you know it could be right like you [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2937.36s)]
*  said this is final three somewhat personal but within your interests if it were just [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2943.28s)]
*  easy and affordable to clone yourself would you do it [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2949.76s)]
*  no i mean what's the point i mean it's not extending your life it's something else and [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2956.0s)]
*  i'm not so in love with my own genes that i think that we need to have more copies of them everywhere [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2964.16s)]
*  yeah i mean as you know there are a lot of people who've had achievements [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2970.72s)]
*  who either they want to have a lot of kids or they speak openly about the idea that having [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2974.64s)]
*  more of their genes in the gene pool through traditional procreation or cloning is a net gain [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2978.72s)]
*  in their view [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2986.48s)]
*  but the genes are just one part of it i mean you can have two people with the same genes and if [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2990.56s)]
*  they have the very different educational life story they will reach very very different places [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=2996.88s)]
*  so i wouldn't put too much emphasis just on the genes yeah all right this is a little sci-fi but [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=3002.16s)]
*  if you could live on say an extra 50 years with your consciousness in a new system [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=3007.44s)]
*  digital or an animal would you do it and if so what would it be [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=3016.48s)]
*  these are the kind of fantastical questions that i never know how how to respond to i mean [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=3027.36s)]
*  ultimately what what matters for me is getting to know myself better [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=3033.36s)]
*  and kind of migrating into a totally different body i i don't see how how it helps me in getting [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=3041.76s)]
*  what if you were truth about myself if you were an owl who could talk and you get another 50 years [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=3051.6s)]
*  but then i wouldn't be an owl i mean you know people who imagine that they imagine that they [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=3059.3599999999997s)]
*  have exactly the same consciousness they have even their own memories they are simply in the [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpiZQSH_D0&t=3063.68s)]
