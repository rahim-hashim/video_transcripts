# 'We will not be able to survive as a country': GOP’s Rep. Spartz on battle over spending cuts
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw)
*  It's important for the Congress, in my view, to assert its authority in this space, because [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=0.0s)]
*  it's given to them. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  It is unique to them in that regard. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=7.04s)]
*  So you have that piece. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=9.4s)]
*  But it also, I think, will continue to point up some of the tensions within the Republican [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=10.48s)]
*  caucus itself. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=18.56s)]
*  And so I would, out of the gate, say for those 32 Republicans, thank you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=20.68s)]
*  It's not a bad thing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=25.96s)]
*  So all the crap and the BS that gets thrown at them for signing the letter, just check [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=27.28s)]
*  that, because the reality of it is, this is the process of making good legislation for [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=31.32s)]
*  the people. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=39.36s)]
*  And you may agree or disagree with the bill itself, but the process does matter. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=40.36s)]
*  And so I'm encouraged by that, and we'll get to talk a little bit more on it, but I just [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=45.56s)]
*  think it's important right now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  So let's talk about the process and about your priorities. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=51.44s)]
*  You're one of the signatories on this letter. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  If your priority is not adding to the deficit, what then would you want to see cut from this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=55.78s)]
*  bill? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=61.02s)]
*  Well, it's actually, thank you for having me. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=62.02s)]
*  Surprisingly enough, I have much more comment talking on this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  It's not in the conversation, because we definitely agree that Congress really abandoned its job. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=66.62s)]
*  It's sadly enough, regardless who is president. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=72.98s)]
*  And this is my term, and I used to be a state senator, and it really breaks my heart to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=75.5s)]
*  see what's happening. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=79.62s)]
*  But unfortunately, there is no bipartisanship in Congress anymore, and a lot of the issues [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=81.3s)]
*  are tough. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=85.38s)]
*  But if we don't put our country on a sustainable fiscal path, we are going to not be able to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=86.38s)]
*  survive as a country. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=93.1s)]
*  So what do you want to see cut? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=94.5s)]
*  Well, if you look at that spending, you know, we have to really—I mean, if you think our [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=95.97999999999999s)]
*  spending before COVID was $4.5 trillion, we moved it to $7 trillion per year, $2.5 trillion, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=100.34s)]
*  in the journey of it attributable to health care. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=107.74s)]
*  And health care didn't get better. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=110.66s)]
*  Americans still go bankrupt. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=112.58s)]
*  We have lots of, you know, profits made on Wall Street, hospitals built in Taj Mahal. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=113.82s)]
*  Executives make a lot of money. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=118.66s)]
*  We saw all of the fraud in the insurance industry happening, and people are pretty much getting [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=120.69999999999999s)]
*  screwed and federal government going bankrupt, states are going bankrupt. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=124.82s)]
*  So we need to start looking how we can make sure that health care can be affordable but [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=127.89999999999999s)]
*  come after true fraud, which used to be bipartisan issue. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=132.18s)]
*  Well, explain to me, though, how a cut to Medicaid gets health care to a place where [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=135.01999999999998s)]
*  it's more affordable. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=139.22s)]
*  Well, listen, it's not cut. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=140.22s)]
*  We are talking about actually something that Vice President Biden at the time was calling [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=141.62s)]
*  a scam, where states, you know, when Medicaid originally were planned, states were supposed [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=145.66s)]
*  to have skin in the game. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=150.26s)]
*  They were partnered to the federal government, you know, to help the most vulnerable people. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=151.5s)]
*  But unfortunately, they caught a lot of consultants, and I'm a CPA, used to be in Big Four business. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=155.78s)]
*  Like, they had very smart CPAs and consultant, they hired, who helped them to pretty much [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=161.3s)]
*  money launder federal government. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=165.9s)]
*  They used provided taxes to do the match, so the states don't have to actually do their [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=167.54s)]
*  share. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=172.66s)]
*  And on top of it now, they charge in Medicaid at the private level rates three times more [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=173.66s)]
*  than Medicare. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=178.26s)]
*  So they cut its services for people with disability, but making a lot of money on Medicaid. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=179.34s)]
*  Look at insurance companies, you know, their profits. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=183.94s)]
*  So look at what's happening. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=186.54s)]
*  The insurance companies definitely need to be reined in and held accountable. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=187.54s)]
*  And I think some of that did happen in the Biden administration, allowing Medicare to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=190.66s)]
*  negotiate drug prices. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=194.45999999999998s)]
*  I guess a lot of people have questions about Medicaid specifically because it is something [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=196.38s)]
*  that touches almost every single person around this country. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=200.38s)]
*  In Indiana specifically, here's some of the stats. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=204.02s)]
*  One point eight million people are enrolled in Indiana in Medicaid. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=206.54000000000002s)]
*  It covers one in six adults ages 19 to 64, covers three in eight children, covers two [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=209.78s)]
*  in three nursing home residents, covers 41 percent of births. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  Would you vote for a bill that has any cuts to Medicaid? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=219.98000000000002s)]
*  No, we tried to improve it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=224.78s)]
*  Actually, in Indiana just recently, our liberal newspaper had articles. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=225.78s)]
*  Three and a half billion was stolen of Medicaid by nursing homes, by hospitals, building Taj [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=229.02s)]
*  Mahal and stealing from seniors. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=234.66s)]
*  But actually, that was Biden rule that allowed now upcharge federal government for Medicaid [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=236.86s)]
*  at the private insurance rate and cut services. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=242.46s)]
*  And since Congress doesn't look at spending, they directly just funnel money from the federal [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=245.46s)]
*  government. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=250.14000000000001s)]
*  We actually want to make sure that Medicaid is better for the people that it's intended [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=251.66s)]
*  to. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=256.58s)]
*  And then let's think how the rest of it is going to work, how we can make health care [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=257.58s)]
*  more affordable. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=262.41999999999996s)]
*  And that is something executive would, I mean, President Trump doesn't get a lot of credit [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=263.5s)]
*  for it, but his executive order and price transparency in February can really change [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=267.26s)]
*  the dynamics. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=272.14s)]
*  And I think that should be a bipartisan issue. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=273.18s)]
*  But unfortunately, machine here is very powerful with money and attacks. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=275.38s)]
*  I think one of the interesting aspects of the Medicaid discussion that, as I said at [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=280.02s)]
*  the beginning, sort of will translate into how within the Republican caucus the members [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=287.53999999999996s)]
*  look at what a cut is and what it is you are cutting. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=292.46s)]
*  And so right now, there is a discussion about what is a benefit cut. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=298.65999999999997s)]
*  And it's a very interesting reporting that basically if you ask most people, when you [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=304.86s)]
*  talk about a cut in benefits, it would be a cut in the benefit I receive from the program. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=310.74s)]
*  So it's either some type of medical service or other benefit that I get through Medicaid. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=316.54s)]
*  Which again, for the record, is not just for the poor. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=322.74s)]
*  It's also for those with disabilities. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=326.68s)]
*  It's also for a lot of our veterans are on Medicaid for a variety of reasons. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=329.02000000000004s)]
*  So it is a very complex issue. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=333.46s)]
*  But the benefit cut question for me is an intriguing one. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=336.26s)]
*  You had Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri saying, lowering the federal match to states and imposing [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=339.5s)]
*  per capita caps may well be benefit cuts, right? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  Leaving Missouri with a choice of slashing programs, raising taxes or throwing residents [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=349.82s)]
*  off Medicaid. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=354.78s)]
*  If so, he's not voting for that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=355.78s)]
*  But then you have Chip Roy from Texas saying that the aggregate Medicaid spending is likely [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=358.58s)]
*  to rise in the long term, even if those restrictions are implemented. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=365.46s)]
*  Therefore it should not be construed as a cut. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=370.58s)]
*  I align myself with Josh Hawley because at the end of the day, if you're capping benefits, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=374.14s)]
*  right, or if you are otherwise redefining what those services are, you're directly [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=381.53999999999996s)]
*  impacting what each one of those beneficiaries is going to receive. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=387.58000000000004s)]
*  How do you see the question of benefit cuts? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=391.18s)]
*  And it really kind of aligns to what Alicia was asking. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=395.46000000000004s)]
*  How do you define it like Josh Hawley or are you defining it like Chip Roy? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=399.22s)]
*  I'll tell you, we're actually not cutting benefits at all because the problem is that [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=403.14000000000004s)]
*  benefits are very low. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=408.66s)]
*  The providers pay very little. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=410.66s)]
*  What is happening on top? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=412.34000000000003s)]
*  Insurance and hospital making money on top. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=414.3s)]
*  And they're building Taj Mahal, defrauding Medicaid, taking money from nursing homes [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=416.94s)]
*  and pay salaries to CEOs. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=422.06s)]
*  So we actually, let me tell you an example. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=424.34s)]
*  And there is a lot of reforms that need to happen in Obamacare. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=427.02s)]
*  If we move Medicaid recipients to Obamacare, which is actually, you know, has some problems [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=429.9s)]
*  too, but it saves us half a trillion and gives better services than Medicaid. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=436.22s)]
*  That's how corrupt Medicaid became because no one voted. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=440.9s)]
*  You're talking about changing Medicaid. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=445.54s)]
*  I guess when you talk to people in your district, and I know you had a town hall that was widely [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=447.3s)]
*  reported and talked about, and I know in the aftermath of that town hall, you noted that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=452.34000000000003s)]
*  you said that some of the people there were paid protesters. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=455.66s)]
*  We looked at some of the local coverage, read some of the local stories. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=458.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, local people care a lot about what's happening with Medicaid in your district, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=461.34000000000003s)]
*  but also throughout the state of Indiana. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=466.18s)]
*  And also they care about the tariff impact. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=467.74s)]
*  We're going to get to that in a second. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=469.02s)]
*  But what we really want to know is, are you able to tell us yes or no if you would vote [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=470.78s)]
*  for a bill that cuts, any cuts to Medicaid? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=476.74s)]
*  Because Josh Hawley is saying, I'm not voting for a bill that imposes caps. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=479.82s)]
*  So if you're imposing it, right. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=486.53999999999996s)]
*  He's saying that, oh no, on the other side of imposing those caps, there's going to be [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=488.53999999999996s)]
*  a growth in the program. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=493.02s)]
*  Therefore, it's not a cut. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=494.38s)]
*  Which is, in my view, BS, because you have to cut the program in order for that growth [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=495.86s)]
*  to come on the other side of it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=501.42s)]
*  So which camp are you in? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=502.7s)]
*  Are you in a third camp that says, well, I want to cut something else? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=503.82s)]
*  No, I'll tell you something. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=506.94s)]
*  You know, actually, I didn't say we had paid protest. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=508.42s)]
*  I said organized by Democrat Party, but that's politics. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=510.74s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=513.7s)]
*  Makes us stronger. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=514.7s)]
*  So it's OK. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=515.7s)]
*  I just think hopefully we'll have a civil conversation at some point and hopefully, and some people [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=516.7s)]
*  actually were very nice. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=519.66s)]
*  And at the end of town hall, actually came and talked to me. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=520.9399999999999s)]
*  So I'm not saying not everyone was just for reason to scream. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=523.58s)]
*  But I'll tell you something, that I am looking how we're going to fix health care and make [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=527.02s)]
*  it affordable for the people. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=530.7s)]
*  So I want to make benefits better. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=532.42s)]
*  So we need to look how we can make Medicaid better for the most vulnerable, for people [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=534.14s)]
*  with disability. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=538.26s)]
*  And then what are we going to do? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=539.26s)]
*  But now, right now, people are getting overcharged. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=541.1s)]
*  So I want to come after fraud that allows us monopolies, insurance, pharma, PBMs, hospitals, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=543.34s)]
*  overbill everyone. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=549.98s)]
*  I mean, make people go bankrupt. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=551.22s)]
*  Make a lot of money. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=553.22s)]
*  Make federal government go bankrupt. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=554.22s)]
*  States go bankrupt. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=555.66s)]
*  Individuals go bankrupt. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=557.1s)]
*  Employers' insurance doubling. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=558.38s)]
*  So we need to be able for that market to function. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=560.22s)]
*  So we need to, because we cannot afford anything. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=562.98s)]
*  Medicare, look at Medicare Advantage. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=565.78s)]
*  Look at site neutrality over billing by hospital and controlling physicians. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=567.98s)]
*  So the market is broken. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=571.46s)]
*  So I actually, I came to this country with one suitcase, and I had to work crazy hours [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=573.5s)]
*  to be able to afford to have my children. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=579.06s)]
*  I was actually had no insurance and had surprise bill that was very significant. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=581.3s)]
*  And that, you know, that could, at that time, it was a lot of money for me that I could [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=587.34s)]
*  barely afford. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=591.1s)]
*  So I understand where health care, how corrupted became. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=592.1s)]
*  And we're getting subsidized. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=595.74s)]
*  And all of this lobbying group spending a ton of money attacking with lies. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=597.66s)]
*  So I want to make sure that we make Medicaid better for people with a tendon, force the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=601.5799999999999s)]
*  to do a better job because they're complaining. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=606.5400000000001s)]
*  But right now, since they don't have skin in the game and can make money, they're not [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=608.94s)]
*  serving their people better. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=612.7s)]
*  But then let's how we can make for the rest of the people more affordable and better value [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=614.02s)]
*  in health care. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=618.5400000000001s)]
*  I want to ask you a political question. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=619.5400000000001s)]
*  So you originally were not going to run for reelection. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=620.7s)]
*  You are now running for reelection. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=622.62s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=624.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, well, let's see. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=625.0600000000001s)]
*  She's still working it out. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=626.0600000000001s)]
*  But I feel bad, you know, I'll be honest with you. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=627.0600000000001s)]
*  This is a great honor. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=633.78s)]
*  But, you know, I get so frustrated with this place because this place has to govern. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=634.86s)]
*  We have to be able to deliver and not to be afraid to challenge special interest group [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=639.78s)]
*  and health care. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=643.8199999999999s)]
*  And this bill is a good example how everyone is afraid because a lot of money spent and [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=644.8199999999999s)]
*  lies. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=650.3399999999999s)]
*  And I think, unfortunately, we will not be able to even talk to each other anymore. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=651.3399999999999s)]
*  Well, that's that's one dynamic. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44w1smsKLSw&t=655.38s)]
