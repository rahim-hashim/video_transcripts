# Mayor Bass: I don’t know what in the world 2,000 national guard, 700 marines would be doing in L.A.
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk)
*  Marines and thousands of National Guard troops into Los Angeles against the wishes of the governor and Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=0.0s)]
*  NBC's Jacob Sobroff is back with us and he is joined by mayor bass [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=7.62s)]
*  Alicia thanks so much. I'm here outside the city's emergency operations center with mayor Bass mayor Bass good to see you [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for joining us live on MSNBC [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=17.94s)]
*  Let me start with the curfew you mentioned earlier today in a press availability that you were considering putting into place a curfew tonight in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=19.7s)]
*  Los Angeles will there be a curfew tonight in Los Angeles? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=27.02s)]
*  I believe there will we are working on the details right now [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=29.82s)]
*  And so I think in the next one or two hours will be able to announce whether we're gonna [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=32.74s)]
*  Want to be a citywide curfew? No, no, no, no, no [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=38.3s)]
*  I think it's so important for people to understand that this is not a citywide issue [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=40.58s)]
*  This is a few blocks within downtown. I don't want to underplay it. It's significant, but it is not our entire city [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=46.34s)]
*  Just a couple of blocks away right now. You mentioned it's just a few blocks [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=53.98s)]
*  We're a couple blocks away from the Metropolitan Detention Center here at the EOC [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=56.94s)]
*  I'm sure our viewers can hear the chopper that's circling above us right now [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=60.68s)]
*  There have also been I've seen federal government choppers from Customs and Border Protection flying around this area [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=64.98s)]
*  How would you characterize mayor what's going on down here? The president says it's an insurrection. What do you call it? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=70.7s)]
*  I mean, it's not an insurrection at all. What you have are a few people again [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=75.98s)]
*  They have done extensive vandalism in the form of graffiti and last night several stores were broken into which is why we're looking at [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=82.08s)]
*  A curfew declaring it an unlawful assembly earlier than normal [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  There's protests happening right now [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=94.36s)]
*  And so at the end of a protest you have a few people who are stragglers and they go out and they create mayhem [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=96.08s)]
*  That is what the situation is. This is not an insurrection. This is not citywide civil unrest [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=103.4s)]
*  He deployed a hundred National Guard soldiers here [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=109.2s)]
*  They are basically guarding the building so I don't know what in the world [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=113.72s)]
*  2,000 National Guard and 700 Marines would be doing in LA [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=118.4s)]
*  You mentioned the Marines. Let me ask you about the Marines [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=122.92s)]
*  Are you concerned with the scope of the Marine Corps mission once those Marine Corps members make it here to LA? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  These as you said the National Guard troops are guarding the federal building the Marine Corps [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=131.28s)]
*  It's unclear but our reporting indicates that they may do more than that. Well, right and that's the issue. It's unclear [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=135.88s)]
*  We don't know what they're doing from one day to the next. For example, we were told that the raids are gonna go on [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=141.76s)]
*  For another 28 days. Is that gonna be the case? Where are they gonna take place? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=148.6s)]
*  We have to wake up in the morning and find out which businesses which workplaces were raided [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=153.88s)]
*  That the Los Angeles Police Department with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department can handle what's happening on the streets of LA without the National Guard [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=160.08s)]
*  100% I believe that you know, ironically on Saturday night [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=168.32s)]
*  The president came out and said that the National Guard is the reason why the protests were quelled and the vandalism was stopped [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  So he went on to congratulate the National Guard [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  Jacob they weren't even here. They weren't even deployed until Sunday. So as far as I'm concerned [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  I think this is unfortunate. This is a stunt [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=188.44s)]
*  It makes me feel like LA might be a grand experiment to see what what the response of the public be [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=191.12s)]
*  If the federal government came in and took over I heard you say that mayor bass last night Rachel on our ear [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=198.36s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  We're you know, what is the next logical extension of the federal troops on the streets of Los Angeles or another American city? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=205.76s)]
*  What do you think he's testing? Well, I think he's testing what the public response would be for example [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=212.08s)]
*  Creating the imagery or saying that there is an insurrection happening here that the city is out of control [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  When anybody in LA knows that's not the case [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=224.56s)]
*  You can go all around LA and the majority of people have not seen anything except for what they've seen on TV [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=227.18s)]
*  So I will tell you on Thursday the day before the raids there was nothing going on in this city [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=233.44s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. And there was nothing that warranted the actions of the next day [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=239.96s)]
*  Chief McDonald the chief of the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=244.92s)]
*  LAPD seemed to indicate the other day that he might be open to the National Guard's presence here [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=247.0s)]
*  But that's not what I hear you saying and all your daylight between you and the chief on that issue [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=252.28s)]
*  No, there is no daylight between the two of us [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=256.08s)]
*  But what he was what he was meaning to was if he needs additional support [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=258.6s)]
*  Los Angeles County has 88 cities in it and a sheriff's department and many of those cities have police departments and he can call [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=264.28s)]
*  For help from around the region Tom Holman told me when I spoke to him in our interview on Saturday night [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  That there would be ice enforcement operations happening in Los Angeles [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=279.04s)]
*  Every day you have evidence of that that that's happened since the beginning of this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes, I think that is accurate. However, we have not heard about one today [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=287.76s)]
*  But what that does is is that it creates a feeling a sense of fear through the whole city [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=292.0s)]
*  Because as you know, this is a city of immigrants and there are certain industries that frankly if you deported everybody those industries would not even function [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=298.4s)]
*  It would be a terrible blow on our economy ice. I'm sorry. Let me ask you about Tom moment as well [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=307.44s)]
*  What he said about about you [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=312.68s)]
*  I mean, I know that you saw that that he told me that if you want to go across the line and he believed that you [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  Had not yet. He would be willing to place you under arrest or refer you to the Department of Justice for arrest [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=319.76s)]
*  Just like I said to Governor Newsom, what's your response? Well, my response is is that that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=325.92s)]
*  Statement is not dignified and doesn't represent the office that he holds and frankly, I think he should be embarrassed [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=330.8s)]
*  Do you have you talked with your security detail have you made preparations for [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=340.08s)]
*  Potential arrests by the federal government. Absolutely not because it's not gonna happen not gonna happen. This all started with [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=345.12s)]
*  Enforcement operations on Friday morning at places like Home Depot's [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=352.41999999999996s)]
*  Or as you said in the garment district in the fashion district right around the corner here in downtown Los Angeles [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=355.97999999999996s)]
*  As the mayor of the city understanding who those people are the day laborers the workers [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=361.74s)]
*  What does that mean to you that they target those location? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=367.78s)]
*  Well, let me just contrast it to what we said was going to have what he said was gonna happen [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=370.02s)]
*  Which is gang members drug dealers violent criminals. That's who they were gonna target [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=374.29999999999995s)]
*  How does that jive with Home Depot workers having to run through the parking lot to escape this? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=379.21999999999997s)]
*  These are people who show up for work every day and basically get work day by day by day [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=386.58s)]
*  To survive our city that is very very expensive to live in in the factory down the street [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=392.17999999999995s)]
*  Actually, it's an interesting story because it's a Korean owned business and the employees were Latino and they came in and they raided that facility [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=399.21999999999997s)]
*  What violent criminals were they looking for when the family members heard that their relatives were being detained? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=407.09999999999997s)]
*  you had [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=414.97999999999996s)]
*  Children and parents coming and some of those children saw their mothers and fathers being carted out [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=416.46s)]
*  We've also heard about people who are legal [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=422.9s)]
*  Who show up for their once-a-year appointment at the immigration office check-in and they're being detained [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=426.34s)]
*  So it creates a sense of fear terror and unsettlement to our city [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=432.66s)]
*  Have you had any communication with the president or she's the chief of staff? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=438.62s)]
*  Well, I was talking to them encouraging the troops not to come so that was before the national [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=444.34000000000003s)]
*  So you're gonna make a request to talk to the president [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=459.22s)]
*  And I'm gonna throw back to Alicia in a second because I know she's got some questions for you as well [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=462.58000000000004s)]
*  But before I do when you spoke to Tom Holman the same day that I did [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=465.70000000000005s)]
*  Did he say any of the stuff that he said to me to you? Absolutely not [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=469.58000000000004s)]
*  He actually thanked me for my message that said that we would not tolerate violence. We had a comfortable conversation [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=472.70000000000005s)]
*  I encouraged him not to deploy troops here [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=480.02000000000004s)]
*  I told him that if he did it would be a provocation and we didn't need to have that [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=483.38s)]
*  Our city is trying to prepare for the World Cup now they're gonna spend a hundred and thirty million dollars bringing out troops [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=488.94s)]
*  Unnecessarily, I would love that money to come to LA so we could prepare for the games in a year [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=496.26s)]
*  My understanding is mayor that ice was spotted and correct me if I'm wrong outside your grandchild's school [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=501.14s)]
*  Yes, what did that feel like to you? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=507.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, it was frightening to me because all of the parents that were getting ready to arrive to pick up her kids [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=511.21999999999997s)]
*  Should they go are they gonna possibly be detained? I heard they did go [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=517.0600000000001s)]
*  Lisa let me get I want to get you in here because I have a couple questions for the mayor mayor [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=526.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm Alicia Menendez mayor just one quick question for you [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=530.0600000000001s)]
*  The fact that these ice raids are happening at workplaces at Home Depot's at car washes at garment factories [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=533.5400000000001s)]
*  You are going to need allies in this fight. What is your message to business leaders? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=540.5400000000001s)]
*  What role do you see for the business community in Los Angeles as it pertains to protecting your workforce? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=546.5s)]
*  Well, I do think that business community that employs immigrant workers needs to make sure that they are well informed about their rights [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=554.38s)]
*  That they have contacts and relationships that they can rely on for legal counsel [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=562.46s)]
*  I will tell you though. However, the people that are detained right now have been denied legal counsel [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=567.6600000000001s)]
*  They've been denied access to their families, but I do think that the workforce needs to be very well educated [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=573.8s)]
*  Now in regards to downtown I've spoken to business leaders today [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=580.04s)]
*  And we are going to be all coming together to figure out how to repair and restore the vandalism that took place [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=584.0s)]
*  Just want to say about the work that [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=595.16s)]
*  Say about the work that the mayor is doing here [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=597.68s)]
*  You know LA City sees a lot of big events [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=600.12s)]
*  Lakers parade Dodgers parade [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=604.04s)]
*  You know unrest of other kinds [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=606.64s)]
*  Usually when the National Guard is called into this city, it's a request made by you or by the governor [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=609.8399999999999s)]
*  This is a unique set of circumstances here [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUSqJfVONk&t=614.4s)]
