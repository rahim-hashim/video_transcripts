# Pete for President in 2028? Buttigieg fuels presidential run rumors by holding Iowa town hall
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA)
*  Let's bring in NBC News senior national politics reporter Natasha Karecki joining me here in studio former Democratic Congressman Joseph Crowley and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=0.0s)]
*  Jonathan Capehart co-host of MSNBC's The Weekend and associate editor of The Washington Post [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=7.86s)]
*  Okay, Jonathan, you know Secretary Buttigieg you've covered him [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=13.46s)]
*  Politically savvy enough to have gone from small-city mayor to a legitimate presidential contender [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=18.42s)]
*  You don't go to Iowa [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Unless you're trying to set the groundwork for something. Of course, of course, and you know what he should be doing that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=26.799999999999997s)]
*  I mean these these [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=33.46s)]
*  That runs for president take a long time [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=35.5s)]
*  Unconscionably so but this is the world we're in and the great thing about Secretary Pete and as you showed in that clip [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  He's been besides the facial hair besides that kicking beard. I'm just gonna say it that beard is working [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=44.84s)]
*  But what is also working is what he's saying there in Iowa [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=50.84s)]
*  He is probably the party one of the party's best communicators [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  He takes very complicated matters and issues and boils them down into bites that people can understand [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=59.22s)]
*  but and you know what else happens because I [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=65.8s)]
*  Challenged the graphics team to get this ready. There were headlines this morning in Iowa newspapers [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=68.64s)]
*  That's just two there are several more. That's why you do it, right? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=74.72s)]
*  That is exactly why you do it you get the you get those headlines [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=79.4s)]
*  But you also started [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=83.0s)]
*  Articulating a message that other Democrats can latch on to and use for their own purposes in addition to himself [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  So congressman, there's governor walls Westmore, even though Westmore has said I'm not running [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  He said that flat out, but they both got events in South Carolina [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=97.96s)]
*  Surprisingly an early and important primary state as well [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  Does not running look this way to you? Is he keeping his options open? What's less more doing? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=107.24s)]
*  Senator when asked back, I think in [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  2007 whether he's running or not. I think he said he wasn't [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  Illinois yes, and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=122.24s)]
*  All of a sudden he became the president the United States [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=124.36s)]
*  You know, but he did it without facial hair. So I'm gonna make [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=127.88s)]
*  And I think it's kind of interesting you see the Chris Chris Murphy Senator Murphy now has a beard [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=132.32s)]
*  Jason Crowe has a beard. I don't know if Jason's considering running for president. It might be a tell now [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=138.24s)]
*  You see losing weight now that's growing a beard exactly, but I agree with Jonathan [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=143.56s)]
*  I think that Pete has an incredible gift that he's able to break down and really create [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=148.72s)]
*  The message more complicated issues. I mean walls isn't bad at it [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=155.16s)]
*  Military backgrounds, that's right [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=161.24s)]
*  And in fact the reason I saw those headlines is because vote vets sent out like a whole long list of the headlines that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=163.24s)]
*  Pete Buddha judge got Jonathan then you have California's governor Gavin Newsom. He's also making headlines [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=169.22s)]
*  He's proposing cutting health care benefits for undocumented immigrants [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=175.46s)]
*  So if you're not here legally, you don't get those state benefits [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=179.94s)]
*  Does that sound like someone who might be stuck with a liberal label in a lot of the country saying I'm not really [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=183.22s)]
*  The short answer is yes [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=190.74s)]
*  I think the complicating thing for the governor is going to be how do you explain that? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=192.82s)]
*  to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=198.1s)]
*  Democratic primary voters out there in the rest of the country. How do how do you explain after years of? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  Doing things as governor as mayor [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=206.85999999999999s)]
*  this [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=209.5s)]
*  Seeming change of heart change of stance [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  I don't know because I don't I have not read myself all the things that are played into what he's proposing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=214.14s)]
*  But on on the face of it just to the regular person's ears like oh wait [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=220.1s)]
*  He's he's moderating himself whether that's going to work [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=225.18s)]
*  I don't know because just as just as secretary Pete has the reputation for [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=230.38s)]
*  Being willing to go to Fox News and go to places where Democrats don't go [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=235.82s)]
*  Governor Newsom has a reputation of being the San Francisco mayor the governor of California the liberal the liberal [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=240.1s)]
*  standard-bearer [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=248.94s)]
*  For all good reasons. Yeah [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=250.06s)]
*  Actually, I think you look at the transition on gender [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=252.62s)]
*  Politics, he's taking a ring. This is kind of an add-on to that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=256.18s)]
*  You know, and it's also something unfortunately, I think many people agree with them about even some Democrats [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=260.5s)]
*  But you know, it's gonna be the health crisis for some of these folks as well [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=266.02s)]
*  It's gonna expose all children if they're if their kids can't get health insurance or can't get coverage [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=270.3s)]
*  It really exposes all children to diseases that that's not good for our country [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=275.78000000000003s)]
*  Let me let me ask you well actually we got a little Natasha because Natasha you've got some new reporting about this new book [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=280.66s)]
*  About President Biden that is forcing the Democratic Party's private reckoning into the public eye [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=286.74s)]
*  Tell us about that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I would say beyond that book the bigger point is there's a parade of books coming out [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=295.18s)]
*  And in each one of them there's there's more allegations that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=301.42s)]
*  Joe Biden was hiding his decline that the people around him were hiding the decline [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=305.78000000000003s)]
*  And as that's happening the people who are running for office right now everyone you just showed [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=312.06s)]
*  They are to a certain extent he put a judge said this yesterday [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=317.62s)]
*  Blaming Biden for the loss. Hey, he didn't get out soon enough. Hey, they hid this from us [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=321.74s)]
*  I think and then you have this tension and what our story said today [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=326.82000000000005s)]
*  Is there's this tension in the party with some just wanting to move on blame everything on Biden and not looking at the party [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=332.14s)]
*  What really went wrong? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=340.38s)]
*  Why did you lose these voters in places like Illinois in places like New York in New Jersey? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=342.14s)]
*  Where they were Democratic voters, you know, can you really blame that on Biden? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=348.85999999999996s)]
*  I mean what these other Democrats are saying is our problems are bigger than that and to just steamroll ahead and not have a reckoning [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=353.41999999999996s)]
*  Is not a way to win in [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=361.5s)]
*  2028 so there's this real tension right now and we had the finance chair of the DNC [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=364.26s)]
*  Going directly at all of these, you know, Stephanie cutter [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=370.38s)]
*  Jenna Malley Dillon David Plouffe saying hey these high-priced consultants [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=376.09999999999997s)]
*  They're blaming everything on Biden when they're the ones who lost this election. We had all the money we had [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=381.29999999999995s)]
*  Let's look at some other things [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=386.65999999999997s)]
*  So there's a real tension in the party right now with how to move forward and to the extent that there are people [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=388.90000000000003s)]
*  connected to the last administration [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=396.82000000000005s)]
*  And they're blaming Biden [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=399.3s)]
*  You have to ask what was their culpability if they're saying it was by its fault [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=401.78000000000003s)]
*  Why weren't they asking questions? Why weren't they pushing back? Why were they, you know going off the record whispering things? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=407.78000000000003s)]
*  But not putting their name behind it. So there's a lot of questions [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=413.94000000000005s)]
*  Right now and and I think there's people just want to move forward [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=417.58000000000004s)]
*  But there's a part of the party that's saying no we have to clear this up [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=421.82000000000005s)]
*  So what's the party to do? I want to ask both of you guys really quickly in the time we have left. I mean [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=425.66s)]
*  There is this feeling [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=431.1s)]
*  And we saw it when when we saw a Joe Biden emerge onto the public stage [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=433.26000000000005s)]
*  There were people who said no, we don't need to do that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=438.06s)]
*  Um, but to the extent [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=442.06s)]
*  That democrats can control it. They can't control a book [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=444.38s)]
*  Joe Biden's going to do what Joe Biden's going to do but to the extent congressman that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=448.14000000000004s)]
*  They can control their own messaging [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=452.7s)]
*  Are they looking in the wrong place? I think right now we have to be focused on the 2026 elections [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=455.34000000000003s)]
*  Winning back the house representatives has to be paramount [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=460.54s)]
*  Uh, and you know, we're going to have this back and forth. You can't stop people from coming up with books [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=463.5s)]
*  I will say this [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=467.26s)]
*  I think that after Joe Biden's first two years in office and passing all that great legislation [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=468.3s)]
*  When he continued to attack further to the left, it was an indication he was going to run again [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=473.26s)]
*  He wanted to avoid the primary is what democratic incumbents or any incumbent wants to do [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=477.82s)]
*  And that's maybe when I think the mothers and fathers of the party should have spoken up more [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=482.46s)]
*  Are you really running? Are you not a transition? Put that aside? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=486.7s)]
*  It's got to be right now about we're talking already about presidential candidates in 2028 [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=489.82s)]
*  But we have to win the house back in 2026 and that should be we're all messaging right now [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=494.14s)]
*  And we shouldn't take our eye off the ball of the guy who is president of the united states right now [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=499.26s)]
*  All these folks who are focused on all biden should go away [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=505.5s)]
*  Well, how about the guy and don't blame biden for donald trump being reelected as president? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=508.86s)]
*  Don't put that on biden donald trump during his entire campaign everything that we are seeing him do [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=515.34s)]
*  Speaking of that take a look take a look at that. This is uh, this is the president as you were just [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=522.14s)]
*  Speaking up. He's at the lusail palace in doha. There's going to be a state dinner [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=527.82s)]
*  This is the only public part of this that we're going to see at this dinner being hosted [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=531.58s)]
*  by the emir of uh qatar [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=537.82s)]
*  As you watch this jonathan i'll let you continue but goodness knows this trip has raised a lot of questions about this president and um the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=541.02s)]
*  Some would argue monetization of the presidency, right raises a lot of questions [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=550.3000000000001s)]
*  But this sort of amplifies the point I was making donald trump ran on a series of promises a series of statements [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=554.22s)]
*  And everything we have seen him do since january 20th. He campaigned on he told us he was going to do that [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=561.74s)]
*  So the fact that president biden got out of the race too late the fact that vice president [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=569.1800000000001s)]
*  president harris had to run a 107 day campaign and and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=574.46s)]

*  writ large and the electorate and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=586.1400000000001s)]

*  He's raised the swamp to 30 000 feet and he's filling that sucker with water as we speak. It is just amazing [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=611.9799999999999s)]
*  That and people saying he's doing it in broad daylight. He's doing right in front of you and therefore it's not so bad. No [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=619.5s)]
*  This is corruption at the highest level [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=626.38s)]
*  You [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsGHtBRZOA&t=637.42s)]
