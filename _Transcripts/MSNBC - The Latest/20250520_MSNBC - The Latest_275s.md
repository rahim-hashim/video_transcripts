# Top House Dem: CBO says Trump budget bill contains $500B in Medicare cuts
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc)
*  Congressman Boyle, this bill, as it comes down to the wire, I think, as we always knew, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=0.0s)]
*  I think you and I, being a member of the Tax Writing Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=6.88s)]
*  everything I was hearing about the things they wanted to throw in this bill made it [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=11.52s)]
*  an impossible bill to begin with. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=15.16s)]
*  It's the big impossible bill. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=18.12s)]
*  That's what should be called. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=20.32s)]
*  And it is just a political disaster zone for these Republican House members, some in your [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  state of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=29.68s)]
*  The ones in New York alone, when they lose their seats, that alone gives the control [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=32.32s)]
*  of the House to the Democrats. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=36.68s)]
*  Are the Republicans in the House tonight aware that this is the vote that could hand over [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=39.44s)]
*  control of the House to you and the Democrats? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=47.16s)]
*  Well, it's great to be with you, Lawrence. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=51.16s)]
*  I will definitely be staying up tonight because I am testifying at that 1 a.m. hearing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  A great sign, as you pointed out, that you're attempting to pull the wool over the eyes [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=59.68s)]
*  of the American people is when you schedule a hearing to begin at 1 o'clock in the morning. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=64.08s)]
*  If they were proud of what they were doing, if they thought that this was something that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=70.08s)]
*  would help them, obviously they would be doing this, you know, during the day, perhaps in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=73.2s)]
*  prime time and not at 1 a.m. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=78.64s)]
*  I do say that this reminds me very much of 2017. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=82.64s)]
*  I believe, believe at the time and was proven correct, that we won the 2018 midterm elections [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  during the summer of 2017 when Republicans passed in the House their bill to repeal and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  not replace Obamacare. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  And the fact that it went down in flames in the Senate didn't change the fact that they [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=103.63999999999999s)]
*  had come so close from getting rid of Obamacare and sure enough, defying November, we won [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=107.7s)]
*  40 seats to win back the House. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=112.98s)]
*  I think, as you do apparently as well, think the same thing is going to happen. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=114.98s)]
*  The one thing I would point out, though, is this bill is actually significantly worse. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=119.34s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=123.06s)]
*  Because this piece of legislation will throw 13 and a half million, almost 14 million Americans [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=124.06s)]
*  off their health care. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=130.46s)]
*  First, you're cutting people off Medicaid. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=131.98000000000002s)]
*  But second, this does include very deep cuts to Obamacare as well. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=134.66s)]
*  And finally, I have breaking news for you tonight that literally just came out in the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=140.1s)]
*  last few minutes as I've been sitting here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=144.3s)]
*  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the official authority on these figures has [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  now confirmed this bill, in addition to Medicaid cuts, in addition to Obamacare cuts, includes [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=153.26s)]
*  $500 billion worth of cuts to Medicare. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=159.9s)]
*  That is now in this bill as well. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=165.17999999999998s)]
*  That is breaking news. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=167.1s)]
*  $500 billion in cuts to Medicare. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=168.1s)]
*  That's the biggest cut to Medicare ever contemplated by the Congress. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=172.22s)]
*  There have been over the years, trims to Medicare for budget reasons, but nothing on this order [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=177.14s)]
*  has ever been done to Medicare. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=187.38s)]
*  What happened, talk more about that, about that breaking news piece that CBO has projected [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=191.38s)]
*  in here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=196.38s)]
*  Is that because of interactions that Medicare has with the Medicaid program? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=197.38s)]
*  Yeah, and forgive me, given your great experience on the Senate Finance Committee, you'll understand [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=203.1s)]
*  this, but it does get a bit wonky for normal folks. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=209.94s)]
*  Basically, it is because of those interactions, and specifically because of a provision called [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=214.38s)]
*  PAYGO. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=219.22s)]
*  That will force a certain amount of Medicare sequestration, again, to the tune, and these [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=221.26000000000002s)]
*  aren't my figures, these are the Congressional Budget Office official figures, $500 billion. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=225.62s)]
*  So they take the biggest cuts to Medicaid in American history, they take massive cuts [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  to Obamacare, and then add on top of that the impact of all of their policies mean a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=237.54000000000002s)]
*  result of the biggest cuts to Medicare in American history on top of all of that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=244.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKZjLwk3sc&t=250.58s)]
