# ‘Biggest trade war since the Great Depression’: Small business sue Trump over tariffs
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0)
*  Joining me now is Ilya Soman, representing five small U.S. businesses challenging the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=0.0s)]
*  president's tariffs in courts. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=5.16s)]
*  He is also the Cato Institute's chair of constitutional studies. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=7.0s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=10.6s)]
*  Ilya, I'm sure yesterday's ruling from the appeals court reinstating Trump's tariffs [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=11.6s)]
*  was disappointing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=16.04s)]
*  So let me start with what do you do now? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  I'll say that it's only slightly disappointing because all it is, is a so-called administrative [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=21.04s)]
*  stay. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=26.76s)]
*  We want a brief stay so that the court can consider whether there should be a longer, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=27.76s)]
*  more permanent stay that would last until the litigation is fully over. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=31.92s)]
*  But we are going to oppose the imposition of a more permanent stay, and we hope the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  administrative stay will therefore be lifted within a couple weeks or so. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=40.44s)]
*  Do you ultimately see this ending up in front of the Supreme Court? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=45.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  It's possible. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Obviously, the case is of great importance, but the Supreme Court decides for itself whether [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  they want to take cases or not. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  If they do go there, we hope that they will see, as the Court of International Trade did, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=57.48s)]
*  that the president's claim to virtually unlimited tariff authority is not supported by the law [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=61.68s)]
*  and would be unconstitutional if any law did try to give him that kind of power. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=67.36s)]
*  You know, the whiplash that we're all feeling, you know, whether you have a 401k or people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=72.56s)]
*  who are just covering, you know, following the tariff news, does not compare to the uncertainty [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=77.24s)]
*  being faced by businesses that you represent. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=82.24s)]
*  Former lead plaintiff in the case, Victor Owen Schwartz, owns a wine company, and this [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=86.0s)]
*  is what he had to say earlier today. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=89.64s)]
*  What do we do now? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=91.64s)]
*  We wake up and rub our crystal ball and try to figure out what the tariffs are going to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  be this morning. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=98.44s)]
*  We have to do so much planning in advance, and then when you have something as impactful [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=99.44s)]
*  as a 10%, 20%, 50% tariff, whatever Mr. Trump decides that morning, you have to have the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=103.68s)]
*  cash to pay for that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  We don't get our goods out of the port until we pay. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=112.96s)]
*  And it hasn't cost more money already? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  Of course it's cost more money. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=119.0s)]
*  You know, we have to plan for that, and our costs are going up. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=120.6s)]
*  As you talk to these folks who you're representing, do you say, hang in there for weeks, months? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=125.63999999999999s)]
*  I can't tell you how long you're going to need to hang in there. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=133.2s)]
*  What are the conversations like that obviously don't break attorney-client privilege? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=136.24s)]
*  So as you say, unfortunately, I cannot reveal conversation with our clients because they're [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  covered by attorney-client privilege. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=145.84s)]
*  But what I will say is this, that it's not only our clients but businesses around the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=147.96s)]
*  country that are suffering the whiplash, as you call it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  This is one of the reasons why we should not have a system where one man can set tariff [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=155.26000000000002s)]
*  policy any time he wants, can impose tariffs or lift them any time he feels like it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=160.44s)]
*  The Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to set tariffs. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  And one reason why is so that there's no one person who has complete control over the system [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=170.68s)]
*  and can manipulate it based on his day-to-day whims. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=175.88s)]
*  If he wakes up on the wrong side of his bed, he decides to impose tariffs on foreign movies [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  that he's threatened to do, or on iPhones, and then lift them or impose them on something [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=183.24s)]
*  else. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  We should have the rule of law in our system of international trade, not the rule of any [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  one man. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=193.02s)]
*  For people who follow politics closely, they may be surprised to see someone from the Cato [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=194.44s)]
*  Institute involved since Cato's been a key defender of largely Republican policy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=199.44s)]
*  So I wonder, though, if you can give us insight. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=205.46s)]
*  I imagine there are a lot of folks who would like to be represented by the quality of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=208.34s)]
*  lawyering and you have to make decisions about that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=212.94s)]
*  Why this case? Why was it important enough for Cato to get involved? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=216.54s)]
*  So I would note I'm not representing them in my role at Cato. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=220.66s)]
*  Cato does not litigate cases. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=224.22s)]
*  I'm representing them as just an individual lawyer. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=226.42s)]
*  And my main job is a professor at George Mason University. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=229.42s)]
*  That said, Cato, at Cato, we are not Republicans or Democrats. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=232.66s)]
*  We are libertarians. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=236.74s)]
*  We support free markets and individual liberty. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=237.74s)]
*  And we oppose the political right or the political left when they threaten free markets and liberty. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=240.38s)]
*  And obviously, Trump starting the biggest trade war since the Great Depression is the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=245.42s)]
*  kind of thing that we can be expected to oppose since we have for decades, since long before [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=249.54s)]
*  I was at Cato have supported free trade. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=254.56s)]
*  Elia Soman, a very important story that so many people are following. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=257.96s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=262.24s)]
*  Thank you for having me on. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnUwrrHTB0&t=265.28s)]
