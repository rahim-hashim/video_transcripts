Video Description: Jen Psaki takes a closer look at how Elon Musk is benefitting from the understanding that doing business with Musk's companies is a way to curry favor with the United States government. And while Trump's trade war makes basic necessities more expensive for new American families, Trump's own family (and business associates) are cashing in on their proximity to the president of the United States as they make deals abroad.

# Trump scoffs at rising prices for families while his inner circle cashes in on foreign deals
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8)
*  So it's been more than a month, if you can believe it, since Donald Trump announced his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=0.0s)]
*  sweeping and pretty ridiculous tariffs. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=4.46s)]
*  But Mr. Art of the Deal, as he calls himself, has not yet struck a single trade deal, not [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  a single one, with any single country. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=13.08s)]
*  But someone very close to him has. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  This you can see right here is Lesotho. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=18.18s)]
*  It's a tiny, tiny country surrounded entirely by South Africa. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=20.5s)]
*  It's literally in the middle of South Africa. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=24.26s)]
*  Now, just to put the size of the country in perspective, which you can definitely tell [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=25.94s)]
*  from the map, it's roughly the size of the state of Maryland, has about a third of the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=29.7s)]
*  population. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=34.48s)]
*  So it's teeny tiny, but it was still hit with tariffs by the Trump team. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=35.74s)]
*  And while Trump and the White House have not managed to strike a deal with the kingdom [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=39.8s)]
*  of Lesotho, The Washington Post reports tonight that Elon Musk has. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=43.74s)]
*  This is from that brand new reporting. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=49.18s)]
*  Less than two weeks after President Donald Trump announced 50 percent tariffs on goods [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=51.26s)]
*  from the tiny African nation of Lesotho, they even note the size, the country's communications [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=56.04s)]
*  regulator held a meeting with representatives of Starlink. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=61.04s)]
*  Now, Starlink, as you all know, is of course Elon Musk's satellite communications company. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=64.32s)]
*  And according to The Washington Post, Starlink had been seeking access to customers in Lesotho [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=69.34s)]
*  for some time. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=74.68s)]
*  But it was not until Trump unveiled the tariffs and called for negotiations over trade deals [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=75.68s)]
*  that leaders of the country awarded Musk's firm the nation's first ever satellite internet [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=80.9s)]
*  service license. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=85.78s)]
*  It's quite a coincidence, isn't it? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=86.78s)]
*  Now, this deal even drew a mention in an internal State Department memo obtained by The Washington [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=89.98s)]
*  Post. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=94.66s)]
*  And here's what that memo said. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=95.66s)]
*  As the government of Lesotho negotiates a trade deal with the United States, it hopes [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=96.66s)]
*  that licensing Starlink demonstrates goodwill and intent to welcome U.S. businesses. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=101.54s)]
*  The diplomatic translation of that for all of you is the government of Lesotho feels [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=107.6s)]
*  like it's being awfully generous with the Starlink deal, and they're hoping that means [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=111.82s)]
*  something good for them down the road. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=116.33999999999999s)]
*  Now, you may be thinking, Elon Musk is the world's richest guy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=118.61999999999999s)]
*  Why would he care about landing the satellite contract for a country the size of Maryland? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  The answer to that question is that it's not just Lesotho. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=128.98s)]
*  The Post also reports that Starlink has won at least partial accommodations from Somalia, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=132.01999999999998s)]
*  the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Vietnam. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=137.54s)]
*  And The Post even notes, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=142.78s)]
*  Now, it would be one thing if countries were just trying to fill the pockets of Elon Musk [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=149.6s)]
*  on their own accord, maybe because they see Musk in the Oval Office a lot, he's close [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=153.34s)]
*  to Trump, you know, they're calculating a benefit. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=157.5s)]
*  But the eye-popping element of today's reporting in The Washington Post is that The Post claims [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=161.34s)]
*  to have obtained internal government messages that show U.S. embassies and the State Department [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=165.86s)]
*  proactively pushing nations towards Starlink. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't get much more blatant than this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=173.98000000000002s)]
*  And I'm just going to quote the story again here because I think it tells you kind of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  what you need to know. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=180.9s)]
*  Under Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has signed at least two cables asking department [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=182.54000000000002s)]
*  staffers worldwide to promote American satellite services, including Starlink, mentioned by [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  name in both missives. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=193.62s)]
*  Now another cable from April 17th reported that Starlink was pushing for a license to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=195.85999999999999s)]
*  operate in Djibouti. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=199.7s)]
*  Embassy staffers in Djibouti responded that they would help Starlink as much as they could. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=201.62s)]
*  When asked for comment, the State Department responded to The Washington Post with this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=206.78s)]
*  Here's what they said, quote, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=210.62s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=221.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=222.66s)]
*  Fair. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=223.66s)]
*  The White House also accurately notes that the Biden administration pushed other nations [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=224.66s)]
*  to work with American satellite companies, including Starlink. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=228.06s)]
*  And that's true. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=230.7s)]
*  They did. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=231.7s)]
*  But here's the thing, as we all know, Starlink's owner was not one of President Biden's biggest [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=232.7s)]
*  donors who was hanging out in the Oval Office all the time, nor was Biden's strong arming [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=237.46s)]
*  foreign countries to help that particular donor. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=241.34s)]
*  Now I should note that spokespeople for Lesotho and Starlink's parent company, SpaceX, didn't [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=244.78s)]
*  respond to The Washington Post request for comment. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=249.06s)]
*  But the White House did. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=252.22s)]
*  And here was the White House's response to this story about Trump's biggest donor, the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=253.9s)]
*  richest man in the world potentially taking advantage of Trump's trade war to cash in [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=257.98s)]
*  abroad. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=262.38s)]
*  Here's what they said. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=263.38s)]
*  That is what a White House spokesperson told The Washington Post today. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=272.38s)]
*  Sounds good, right? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=275.66s)]
*  The only consideration in Trump's trade negotiations is what is best for the American people. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=276.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  I want you to keep that quote in mind, so I repeated it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=284.02s)]
*  As you listen to what Trump said today in the Oval Office about the idea of creating [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=286.41999999999996s)]
*  tariff exemptions to help working families. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=290.5s)]
*  The Treasury Secretary just told lawmakers that a tariff exemption for certain baby items [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=295.5s)]
*  like car seats is under consideration. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=300.53999999999996s)]
*  Will you exempt some products that families rely on? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=302.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=304.94s)]
*  I'll think about it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=305.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=306.94s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=307.94s)]
*  I want to make it nice and simple. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=308.94s)]
*  I don't have so many exemptions that nobody knows what's doing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=310.42s)]
*  We have to make it very simple, but I'll take a look at it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=313.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=317.06s)]
*  Again, their quote, the only consideration in Trump's trade negotiations is what is [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=318.06s)]
*  best for the American people. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=324.82s)]
*  But should those people be able to afford car seats for their babies? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=327.34s)]
*  Well, Trump doesn't know. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=330.38s)]
*  He's going to have to think about it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=332.06s)]
*  And that piece about the State Department reportedly pushing Elon Musk's satellite [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=334.54s)]
*  company abroad while countries are trying to find their way out of Trump's tariffs [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=338.34s)]
*  wasn't even the only blockbuster piece about tariffs out of the Washington Post today. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=342.38s)]
*  There was also this headline. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=346.38s)]
*  Trump's tariffs hit baby industry hard, threatening parents with price hikes, shortages. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=348.38s)]
*  Virtually every car seat, stroller, bassinet and changing table sold in the U.S. is made [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=353.7s)]
*  in China. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=358.46s)]
*  Now, the story also cites quite a statistic from the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=359.46s)]
*  Here's what it says. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=364.53999999999996s)]
*  And the thing about baby products, and I have two kids, they're not babies anymore, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=398.14s)]
*  but I know what it's like to buy baby products, is if you have a baby, they aren't optional. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=406.86s)]
*  If you have a baby, you need a crib. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=411.53999999999996s)]
*  It's federal law that you cannot drive your baby anywhere without a car seat. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=413.86s)]
*  Most hospitals literally won't even let you take your baby home out of the hospital unless [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=417.7s)]
*  you have a car seat. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=422.58s)]
*  But should car seats be exempted from tariffs? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=424.38s)]
*  Well, Trump doesn't know. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=427.06s)]
*  Who's going to think about that one? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=428.54s)]
*  Look, the reality here is that if Trump doesn't back down on his tariffs, or at least, very [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=430.74s)]
*  least, I should say, exempt necessary products like cribs and car seats, a lot of parents [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=435.82s)]
*  aren't going to be able to afford basic necessities for their babies. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=441.02s)]
*  A childhood studies professor at Rutgers University put it to the Post this way. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=444.58s)]
*  If these tariffs stay in place, there's a good chance there's going to be a stronger [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=448.94s)]
*  It's a perfect time to re-raise their statement. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=453.3s)]
*  Remind me, what was the White House's statement about Trump's tariffs again? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=461.97999999999996s)]
*  Here it is, right there. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=465.3s)]
*  The only consideration in the Trump administration's trade negotiations with other countries is [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=466.8s)]
*  what's best for the American people. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=471.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=474.58s)]
*  Some prices are going up. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=477.09999999999997s)]
*  Tires, strollers, some clothing in the wake of your tariffs. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=478.7s)]
*  That's peanuts compared to energy. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=482.62s)]
*  Energy is 60% of the cost. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=485.58s)]
*  But sir, you campaigned on a promise to bring prices down on day one. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=488.14s)]
*  I don't know, when you say strollers are going up, what kind of a thing? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=492.98s)]
*  I'm saying that gasoline is going down. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=496.58s)]
*  Gasoline is thousands of times more important than a stroller sometimes. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=499.56s)]
*  If you're a parent right now, or an aspiring parent, or maybe you're a grandparent, or [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=506.38s)]
*  just an aunt who wants to help your friend out, and you're worried about the price of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=509.78s)]
*  strollers, which a lot of people are, it's certainly not peanuts. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=513.98s)]
*  President says he has bigger things to worry about than making sure you can pay for things [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=517.98s)]
*  for your kids. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=521.5s)]
*  That's pretty clear. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=522.5s)]
*  But when it comes to his own two large adult sons, he seems pretty focused on making sure [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=523.5s)]
*  they want for nothing. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=528.62s)]
*  I mean, take a look at this. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=530.1s)]
*  This is a brand new hotel and apartment building going up in Dubai. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=531.66s)]
*  It is very, very fancy. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=536.16s)]
*  Every window opens to the sea, it says. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=538.54s)]
*  It has a golf simulator, an infinity pool, and some weird looking treadmills in the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=540.5799999999999s)]
*  gym. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=545.66s)]
*  It's a place where you can apparently put on a gold dress, put your hands up against [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=546.66s)]
*  the big glass window, and stop at nothing, whatever that means. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=550.42s)]
*  This is obviously the new Trump Tower building being built in Dubai. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=554.86s)]
*  And Donald Trump's kids do not need to worry about the price of strollers right now, obviously, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=558.26s)]
*  because they just signed a lucrative deal to build this huge tower, where individual [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=562.66s)]
*  units are selling for a $20 million price tag, a piece. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=566.9s)]
*  It's not just Dubai either. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=571.86s)]
*  There's also the brand new building under construction in Saudi Arabia, which has some [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=573.62s)]
*  pretty freaky looking big cat art in the lobby for some reason. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=576.78s)]
*  I can't explain that one. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=580.42s)]
*  And hey, look, the same funky treadmills from Dubai. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=581.98s)]
*  And also a brand new complex in Qatar, where Eric Trump was just inspecting the miniature [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=585.34s)]
*  size model like he is in Zoolander or something. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=589.7s)]
*  And real estate may be the bread and butter of the Trump Organization. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=593.46s)]
*  But these days, the Trump boys have expanded the family business, shall we say. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=596.78s)]
*  They have not won, but two Trump-branded cryptocurrency ventures. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=601.38s)]
*  To put it simply, when anyone buys these Trump currencies, it helps the Trump kids make more [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=604.9s)]
*  money. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=609.86s)]
*  I mean, right now, the boys are running a kind of a contest of sorts, where the people [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=610.86s)]
*  who buy the most of Trump's meme coin get to have dinner with their dad, Donald Trump. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=615.18s)]
*  Not this weird cartoon drawing of him. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=620.9399999999999s)]
*  The more money you pay the Trump kids, the more likely it is you get to have dinner with [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=623.22s)]
*  the actual president of the United States. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=627.6600000000001s)]
*  Bloomberg News actually reports today that more than half of the people who own the most [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=630.62s)]
*  of the Trump meme coin are likely foreign, meaning the Trump kids have not only built [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=635.1800000000001s)]
*  themselves a gigantic cash register to let people buy access to their dad, but they are [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=640.1600000000001s)]
*  essentially selling access to the president of the United States to foreigners. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=646.3000000000001s)]
*  Now, perhaps they can all hang out at the new private membership club in D.C., which [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=650.42s)]
*  happens to be co-owned by Trump's oldest son. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=654.74s)]
*  It seems to be quite a happening place. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=656.9799999999999s)]
*  President's attorney general, other members of his administration have already been seen [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=659.54s)]
*  at the club's events, which is perhaps why they are literally calling the club the executive [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=663.3199999999999s)]
*  branch. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=668.8199999999999s)]
*  They're not even trying to hide it here. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=670.36s)]
*  Membership fees, and this is eye-popping, are $500,000 just to walk in the door. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=672.4599999999999s)]
*  $500,000 to access the executive branch. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=678.5s)]
*  And yes, again, the name is just so on the nose. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=681.46s)]
*  It's almost like they are trolling us at this point in some way. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=684.9s)]
*  But brazen or not, and this is definitely brazen, the president's adult children and [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=688.94s)]
*  his best buddy Elon Musk are perhaps the only people in America actually making money off [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=692.94s)]
*  of this administration. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=698.66s)]
*  That includes the president himself, who also financially benefits from many of these griffs [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=700.74s)]
*  being run by his two kids. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=705.04s)]
*  So again, to recap, you can have two new Trump towers, you can have one new complex [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=707.38s)]
*  and cutter, you can have multiple cryptocurrencies, it seems, and a members-only club. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=712.58s)]
*  But you cannot, I repeat, you cannot have a new stroller or apparently a new doll. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiPr-mW1X8&t=716.74s)]
