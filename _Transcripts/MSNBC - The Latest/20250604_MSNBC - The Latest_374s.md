# Musk calls spending bill a 'disgusting abomination'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns)
*  Joining us now, New York Times bestselling author and award-winning podcast host Sammy Sage. Sammy, my friend, thanks for coming into the studio. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=0.0s)]
*  Talk a little bit about what you think is happening here because sources close to Musk say that this ranges from [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=7.12s)]
*  an outgrowth of his desire to remain in government longer as a special government employee. Obviously, that's not something the administration did. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=14.08s)]
*  It's also related to the energy and electric vehicle requirements that didn't end up making it in this bill. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=21.6s)]
*  But is it deeper than that? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=28.580000000000002s)]
*  Well, my guess is that there is probably something deeper behind it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=30.34s)]
*  But according to the reporting, he was mostly upset about the fact that he is only a special government employee, so he will have to leave. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=34.1s)]
*  He was upset that Starlink was not going to be getting an FAA contract and about the EV tax credit in the bill. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=41.660000000000004s)]
*  And then on Monday, Donald Trump announced that he was pulling his preferred nominee to run NASA. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=48.1s)]
*  So my sense is that there's something happening between these two, maybe behind the scenes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=54.02s)]
*  And Elon is here for his businesses. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  When you look at Doge, I think that you see that he had maybe gotten about a dozen investigations closed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  And you have to wonder, is Donald Trump wishing that he maybe did not just cut things willy nilly because Elon said so? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  I also think there's this idea that we've been driving towards this. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=76.54s)]
*  We knew that these two big personalities who like to be the center of the rooms that they are in couldn't continue to split focus for the entirety of the administration. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=80.38s)]
*  And yet I think the interesting piece here is Elon Musk has always been sort of a built in political enforcer for Trump, not just because of the Doge stuff, but because he's willing to spend millions of dollars on politicians and policy priorities that Trump likes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=90.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=105.17999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's not just that, but they had sort of a mutually assured destruction thing going on because Elon Musk doesn't just have money to pour into challengers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=105.66s)]
*  He actually has this algorithmic power with Twitter. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=113.9s)]
*  And even though there are fewer users on that than, let's say, a meta platform, the fact is that that drives a lot of conversation and he's able to put his thumb on the scale for all. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=118.18s)]
*  I think we've caught on by now that things that are not necessarily true can catch on regardless of how ridiculous they are. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=127.82s)]
*  But I do think it's interesting that Elon goes to call out how there's going to be two point three trillion dollars of debt that's going to crush the American people, because I seem to remember a few months ago when he promised he was going to cut about that much from the government budget. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=134.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=148.42s)]
*  So if I'm Trump, I'm thinking, well, you told me you were going to you told me you were going to cut this money. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=148.62s)]
*  And he even said apparently last week, you know, was it all BS? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=153.46s)]
*  Did he did he fool me? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=156.98s)]
*  And you have to wonder, did he fool him? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=158.78s)]
*  Yeah. Well, and we all knew that that claim of cutting a trillion dollars was going to do was was just not going to be plausible the way that he was going about it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=161.58s)]
*  But then you layer the politics on top of this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=170.14000000000001s)]
*  What do you think this actually means in the halls of Congress for members who went home to their districts, took rhetorical beatings from their constituents, defending Musk and Doge. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=172.62s)]
*  And now he's throwing them all under the bus. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=183.78s)]
*  I think their situation in terms of the rhetorical beatings they're getting is that's going to keep happening, I think, as long as what they are doing in the administration is not helpful to the American people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=186.58s)]
*  And here we have, I believe the CBO estimated five to seven million people will lose Medicaid. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=198.22s)]
*  That is something that I think senators, especially in red states, are very concerned about. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=203.74s)]
*  And I think that my sense is that this there was some opposition to it among the Senate, enough that they could lose enough votes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=208.18s)]
*  There are some real deficit hawks who seem to actually care about this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=215.9s)]
*  And this is a crush. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=219.3s)]
*  Like to use Elon Musk's words, he's not wrong about the fact that this is going to be a crushing debt. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  And I think that this almost gives them cover to rewrite parts of the bill, send it back to the House and maybe get some of those less savory provisions taken out. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=227.02s)]
*  Yeah, I was talking to a lawmaker yesterday who seemed all but assured in the morning that this bill was going to pass among Senate Republicans. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=237.54000000000002s)]
*  The deficit hawks were going to do there what they did in the House, which is ultimately fold for the party line. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=245.1s)]
*  And now I think this really does shake up the dynamics. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=250.38s)]
*  My final question, I guess, is where is the opportunity for Democrats in all of this who are now saying things they never thought they would say before? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=253.86s)]
*  Like the words, I agree with Elon Musk. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=260.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is the thing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=262.42s)]
*  Does he does he? Why is why did Elon Musk say this? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=264.14s)]
*  Did he say it because he really cares or did he say it? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=266.62s)]
*  Not political altruism. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=268.66s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Or just or real altruism. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=269.74s)]
*  I think that the opportunity with Democrats is that they're so used to saying things like this is going to add trillions to the deficit or that this many people are going to lose their health care. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=272.46s)]
*  And I think what they should do is be pointing out things in the bill that are a little less obvious, but sound sort of deeply unsavory. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=281.78s)]
*  I think what Marjorie Taylor Greene did yesterday by calling out this 10 year moratorium on regulating A.I. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=289.62s)]
*  in the states seems like one of those things where if you point out smaller things that are in it, you know, this provision that would force courts would basically take away courts ability to enforce their own [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=295.70000000000005s)]
*  ruling. The more I think that Democrats point out these sort of really anti-democratic pieces of the bill, it makes it seem a bit more underhanded than sort of the usual. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=308.02000000000004s)]
*  You're going to lose health insurance and we're going to have a lot of debt. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=318.34000000000003s)]
*  I know that that is obviously a huge concern, but I think we've seen members of Congress, they're OK to vote for that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=321.82s)]
*  They're not going to. They'll be fine. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=328.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And you and I have talked about the fact that in pieces of legislation like this, I've covered them a million times. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=329.46s)]
*  It's massive packages that, yes, include Medicaid cuts or snap cuts. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=335.14s)]
*  But then there's also a lot of other things embedded within it that obviously even some of the members didn't even get a chance to read, Sammy. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=338.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=346.05999999999995s)]
*  Or they didn't want to. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=346.98s)]
*  Or they didn't want to. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=348.22s)]
*  Sammy Sage, a conversation for a future time. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=349.74s)]
*  Thank you, as always, for coming in. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71qyiZZACns&t=351.94s)]
