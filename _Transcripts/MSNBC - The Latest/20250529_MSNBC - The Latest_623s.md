# 'Full on assault': Harvard commencement clouded by Trump legal battle
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk)
*  I want to bring in NBC's Antonia Hilton, who is at Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=0.0s)]
*  Peter Baker is chief White House correspondent for the New York Times and an MSNBC political [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=5.12s)]
*  analyst. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=9.52s)]
*  With me here in studio, MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin and James Sample, law professor [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=10.52s)]
*  at Hofstra and former attorney at the Brennan Center's for Justice Democracy program. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  Lisa, give us a rundown. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=20.32s)]
*  What happened in court today? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=21.64s)]
*  What happened in court today, Chris, was very short, and you recapped it really nicely. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=22.64s)]
*  The judge leaving in place a temporary restraining order, although telling the parties that they [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=26.6s)]
*  may negotiate some language about what that restraining order looks like. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  The reason today, though, was so short and wasn't what we expected is because at the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=35.44s)]
*  11th hour, the administration sent a letter to Harvard doing what it should have done [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  all along, which is informing them of their notice to withdraw Harvard from the program [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=43.16s)]
*  that allows that to enroll foreign students. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=48.6s)]
*  You'll remember that a few weeks ago, the administration went to Harvard and said, we [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=51.84s)]
*  are immediately revoking your certification under the CEVP program. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=54.62s)]
*  That's the program that allows universities all over the country to enroll foreign students. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=59.3s)]
*  Now they've sort of gone back on that and are abiding by the regulatory framework that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  exists for when you can terminate a university's program. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=67.88s)]
*  In light of that, Harvard now has 30 days to go back to the Department of Homeland Security [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=71.5s)]
*  with evidence, including sworn declarations and otherwise to say, no, we have complied [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=76.42s)]
*  with our obligations. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=81.06s)]
*  But that also means that a preliminary injunction would not have been appropriate because there's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=82.46s)]
*  still process to play out between Harvard and the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=87.22s)]
*  And James, I noted that Harvard's attorney seemed to be looking for more from the, this [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  is a chaotic situation for the university, for the students. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=94.74s)]
*  So is there more that the judge could and maybe should have done? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=98.38s)]
*  Well, there's more that can be done in the future. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=101.5s)]
*  But I think that the judge made the proper decision in terms of what she did today in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=104.13999999999999s)]
*  the sense that, as Lisa said, you know, there are still processes to play out. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=108.74s)]
*  And in a sense, the TRO here was not just about constitutional issues, First Amendment [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=112.97999999999999s)]
*  and the Fifth Amendment due process clause, but also about the Administrative Procedure [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=118.3s)]
*  Act, which basically says statutorily, there's a process that you, the government, need to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=122.14s)]
*  follow. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=127.38s)]
*  It's not that the government doesn't potentially have the power to do some of the things that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=128.38s)]
*  it's trying to do here. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=132.29999999999998s)]
*  Potentially they do, but they have to follow the processes that are set forth in the law. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=133.5s)]
*  And the judge is essentially saying on Friday, that didn't happen here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=138.94s)]
*  Now the government, faced with that ruling, faced with the specter of further consequences, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=142.58s)]
*  further adverse rulings, is essentially, we're at a pause. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=147.54s)]
*  This is a stay. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=151.58s)]
*  That's a totally appropriate thing for a TRO. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=152.7s)]
*  And essentially saying, come back to us. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=155.38s)]
*  We'll see where we are. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=157.78s)]
*  It may be 30 days. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=159.38s)]
*  It may be less than that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=160.54s)]
*  But I think it's appropriately cautious on the part of the judge to say, we'll see before [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=161.86s)]
*  we make any further rules. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=167.24s)]
*  Harvard's not in an enviable position here, even though they're likely to keep winning. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=168.72s)]
*  They would argue they're in a terrible position, and their students are in a terrible position. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=172.4s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=175.8s)]
*  Well, let's go to Harvard. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=176.8s)]
*  Antonia, what is the mood on campus today? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=177.8s)]
*  It is graduation day, after all. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=179.24s)]
*  Should be all celebratory. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=181.36s)]
*  Well, you know, the good news is a lot of the students here are still celebrating, and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  there is this sort of air of defiance baked into all of that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=189.12s)]
*  There is not a single person here who is not aware of the split screen that they're here [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  in the Harvard yard reflecting on the last four or so years of their lives, while there [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=197.12s)]
*  are lawyers in there trying to defend essentially the rights of other students to come to this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  campus and engage in the same community. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=207.52s)]
*  That's on everyone's mind at the moment. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  The reality is, though, that even with this restraining order in place, even if Harvard [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  keeps winning, it has destabilized everything. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=219.44s)]
*  So if you are, say, 17 or 18 years old and you are planning to come to the United States [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=223.44s)]
*  for the very first time this fall, no matter what you're really told, you're probably a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=227.44s)]
*  bit shaken right now by this news. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=232.16s)]
*  And in fact, that was on the mind of one international student that I spoke to this morning before [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=234.68s)]
*  he processed into graduation. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  Take a little listen to our conversation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=241.4s)]
*  Trump's threat against Harvard are truly hanging over us, because without the international [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=243.4s)]
*  students, Harvard is not Harvard anymore. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, we might be the last international class in a while. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=252.72s)]
*  Everyone is truly uniting and realizing that what Trump is doing is a full-on assault on [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=256.52s)]
*  our university. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=261.52s)]
*  We saw President Alan Garber get a standing ovation this morning. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=264.88s)]
*  He got a standing ovation yesterday at another pre-graduation celebration. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=269.4s)]
*  He's become something of a folk hero now here in the Boston area, and not just to Harvard [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=274.8s)]
*  students and faculty members, but actually to people at all the universities that are [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=280.72s)]
*  very afraid that the kind of conflict that we see playing out at this campus is soon [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  going to come to them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  What I keep hearing from faculty, even conservative faculty who perhaps agree with the Trump [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  administration on some of their accusations or broader ideas, is that what's at stake [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=296.52s)]
*  here is are we going to allow the president of the United States to be able to tell private [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=302.32s)]
*  or public institutions of higher learning what they can teach, who they can hire and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  give tenure to, and really reshape and try to mold schools into their specific ideological [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=311.04s)]
*  project? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=318.0s)]
*  Everyone on both ends of the spectrum here at this school in this area, they reject that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=319.24s)]
*  And certainly schools with fewer resources than Harvard has, they're really looking to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=324.68s)]
*  this school to stay in the fight. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  And so I had a chance to speak with someone in Harvard leadership, and what they said [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  is no matter how bruising this process may be, the reality is they feel that they have [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=336.0s)]
*  to do it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=340.88s)]
*  They have no other choice because of what is at stake here. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=341.88s)]
*  Chris? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=345.72s)]
*  No doubt the stakes are high. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=346.72s)]
*  Antonia, thank you for that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=347.72s)]
*  James, according to the Harvard Crimson, they interviewed the person who's in charge of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=349.16s)]
*  the international program there. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=353.0s)]
*  And here's part of what was said. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=354.44s)]
*  Students skipped graduation ceremonies, canceled international travel, and in some cases began [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=357.08s)]
*  seeking transfer. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=362.32s)]
*  Some also reported fears of being forced to return to countries where they face active [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=363.78s)]
*  conflict or political persecution. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=368.44s)]
*  Do they have reason to be afraid? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=372.14s)]
*  Because this hearing, again, while it may be legally appropriate, was not necessarily [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=373.9s)]
*  helpful to them in the way they wanted it to be. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=379.73999999999995s)]
*  I think that's a very well framed question, Chris. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=382.41999999999996s)]
*  The students here are collateral damage in the Trump administration's personal vendetta [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=386.02s)]
*  against an institution and against institutions of higher learning in general. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=391.1s)]
*  The students are the ones who will suffer the consequences. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=396.46000000000004s)]
*  But so will American soft power. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=400.06s)]
*  We've seen this in other contexts as well. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=402.14000000000004s)]
*  It's not just that these students come to the United States and then do wonderful things [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=405.06s)]
*  in our universities and help our research and help grow the American expertise in all [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=410.34000000000003s)]
*  manner of fields. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=418.62s)]
*  It's that they then return to their homeland after spending time here in the United States [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=419.62s)]
*  with a better view of the United States. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=423.18s)]
*  This is a form of soft power. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=425.54s)]
*  It's the kind of thing that the Fulbright program was meant to, in the Marshall Plan, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=427.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean this is part and parcel of American soft power and building the reputation in [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=432.26000000000005s)]
*  addition to building the expertise around the globe. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=437.3s)]
*  And so the students here, yeah, they have every reason to be afraid because the administration [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=440.58000000000004s)]
*  has proven time and again, they're not interested in the individuals who are collateral damage. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=445.02000000000004s)]
*  Peter, all this is happening as the administration is pushing a much broader effort to vet all [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=449.66s)]
*  international students. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=455.1s)]
*  In fact, we learned late yesterday from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, they're going to aggressively [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=456.1s)]
*  revoke Chinese student visas. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=461.40000000000003s)]
*  And the president actually talked about all of it just yesterday. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=464.0s)]
*  We want to know where those students come. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=468.46000000000004s)]
*  Are they troublemakers? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=470.02000000000004s)]
*  What countries do they come? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=471.24s)]
*  And we're not going to, if somebody is coming from a certain country and they're 100% fine, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  which I hope most of them are, but many of them won't be, you're going to see some very [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=477.72s)]
*  radical people. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=481.68s)]
*  They're taking people from areas of the world that are very radicalized. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=482.68s)]
*  And we don't want them making trouble in our country. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=487.08s)]
*  Or maybe they're fleeing the radicalization. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=490.06s)]
*  So Peter, it begs the question, does the White House have a plan to uncover these supposed [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=492.52s)]
*  troublemakers? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=498.68s)]
*  When they talk about vetting social media or digging into people's backgrounds, do [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=499.68s)]
*  they have any real plan or idea of what exactly they're looking for? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=504.0s)]
*  Well, they haven't identified any kind of standards yet at this point that would be [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=508.8s)]
*  used across the board and which you could therefore understand what the policy is. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=515.5600000000001s)]
*  They're simply saying that they're going to make their own determinations. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  We've seen these four months since Trump took office again, individual cases where they [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=522.76s)]
*  have scooped up international students or people here on visas from other countries [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=526.88s)]
*  based on apparently their free expression of ideas that don't suit what the administration [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=532.52s)]
*  wants to be said in this country. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=538.72s)]
*  People who support causes that the administration doesn't agree with, people who wrote a student [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=541.32s)]
*  who wrote an editorial, co-wrote an editorial in a university student paper, that was enough [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=546.32s)]
*  to scoop them up and say, we're going to send you back. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=551.54s)]
*  They've made very clear that they are suspicious of people from other parts of the country, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  which is really interesting, other parts of the world. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=560.72s)]
*  What's really interesting is that I think that a lot of people had the impression, and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=562.36s)]
*  certainly this was the impression that Trump people encouraged when he ran for office, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=565.48s)]
*  that his crackdown on immigration was a crackdown on illegal immigration. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=569.8s)]
*  The people who were here legally had nothing to worry about with him. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=573.48s)]
*  In fact, actually, what we've seen in the four months since he took office again is a [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=577.36s)]
*  much more wide scale attack on immigration more broadly, including people who were here [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=580.96s)]
*  legally under various programs, either student visas, under refugee programs, under temporary [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=585.44s)]
*  protected status programs. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=590.44s)]
*  And time and time again, this administration made clear that they're suspicious of people [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=592.48s)]
*  here even legally. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=596.0s)]
*  And I think that they are trying to expand the net as far as they can. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWNCzVGpdHk&t=598.0s)]
