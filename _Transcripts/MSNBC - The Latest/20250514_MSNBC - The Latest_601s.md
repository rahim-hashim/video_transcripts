# 'President of the United States is for sale': Ex-National Security official on Trump accepting jet
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo)
*  Ambassador President Trump went into Qatar already having gotten something he apparently [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=0.0s)]
*  really wanted, a fancy plane. Plus, he and his family, we know, have major business [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=4.08s)]
*  interests in Qatar. But what are the nation's interests there? What does the U.S. get out of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=9.44s)]
*  anything potentially in terms of its relationship with Qatar and what they might offer America? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=15.6s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of aggravation for the American public, first of all, on the downside. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=23.119999999999997s)]
*  Qatar has been hosting for many years the Hamas political leadership and has provided an enormous [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=31.52s)]
*  amount of money to that terrorist organization, notwithstanding American protests to the contrary. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=37.76s)]
*  Also, it has been a supporting country of the Taliban. And finally, there's been millions, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  if not billions of dollars that Qatar has dispatched to universities around the country [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=51.84s)]
*  to promote an ideological Qatari-based Muslim Brotherhood theology on campuses that have [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=57.68000000000001s)]
*  contributed to the incitement of violence after the 2023 attack by Hamas against Israel. Now, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=65.44s)]
*  on the positive side, Qatar has been involved in serving as a mediator in trying to secure a cease [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=73.68s)]
*  fire. It also hosts the largest Air Force base for the United States in the Middle East. But [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=80.88s)]
*  I take Qatar as a situation for any American diplomat. It is not the glass half full. It is [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=87.92s)]
*  the glass half empty. It is constantly trying to buy not just from the president, but from the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=96.0s)]
*  American people influence, mostly to the bad, not to the good. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  Ben, I'm told that the president just called the Amir of Qatar a tall, handsome guy as part [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=108.56s)]
*  of those remarks as we watch them now get up from the desk and move on to whatever's next on the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=115.2s)]
*  president's agenda. And so I'm wondering what you're thinking watching all of this, Ben. What [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=121.28s)]
*  could Qatar be seeking in return from the U.S. on this trip after giving the president a jet, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=127.12s)]
*  after being called tall and handsome? Well, look, I think Qatar is playing the same game [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=132.32s)]
*  that the Saudis and the Emiratis are playing. In fact, they're the smaller Gulf Arab country, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=139.68s)]
*  and they're looking around and they're saying, well, how do you do business with Trump? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  And they saw Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, go to Saudi Arabia after the first [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=148.0s)]
*  Trump term and get $2 billion for his investment fund. And that was not an investment from the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=154.32s)]
*  Saudis and Jared Kushner's investment acumen. That was an investment in the Trump family. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=160.88s)]
*  They saw Trump's family go to the United Arab Emirates, where he'll be tomorrow, and get [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=166.56s)]
*  hundreds of millions, I think billions of dollars of investment in Trump's new crypto enterprises [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=173.6s)]
*  that directly benefits the Trump family. So this is how business is done with Trump, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=179.44s)]
*  and this is how the transactionals works in a part of the world where there's obviously [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=185.92s)]
*  tremendous money from oil and gas wealth. And so I think what's so notable about this, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=190.64s)]
*  obviously, the gift of Air Force One would be a different level in terms of what it symbolizes, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  in terms of its proximity to the president. But actually, I think the real story here is [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=202.72s)]
*  it's not unusual that essentially all these governments have taken the measure of Trump, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=206.72s)]
*  and they're like, well, the way to do business with him is how we do business, by the way, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=211.27999999999997s)]
*  with other corrupt countries around the world. This is not a new element of interaction in this [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=215.04s)]
*  part of the world. What's new about it is that the president of the United States is for sale. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=221.04s)]
*  The family of the president of the United States is for sale. It's the United States, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=225.28s)]
*  which controls the world's largest military, which has Air Force bases in Doha, which has [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  military bases across this region. And so I think that's—I'm not surprised countries are doing [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=234.0s)]
*  this, and they're not alone in doing it. And that's actually what I think should be so alarming to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  people, is the normalization of corruption at the highest levels with a seeming infinite amount of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=243.36s)]
*  money. What they want in return is they want security. They want their interests protected. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=249.28s)]
*  They don't want to be criticized for human rights violations, whether you're Mohammed bin [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=253.12s)]
*  Salman or whether you're the governor of Qatar. They're going to want things in the future from [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=256.56s)]
*  the United States. They want technology from the United States. So, of course, there's a quid pro [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=260.48s)]
*  quo here. And I think the lesson to these governments and to governments, other governments [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=266.0s)]
*  around the world, too, is that this is how you do business with Trump. You pay him directly. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=271.12s)]
*  And as Kelly pointed out, though, Trump wasn't always like this. I mean, when you look back to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=276.08s)]
*  his campaign prior to his first term, he was saying things that were more in alignment of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=280.4s)]
*  what we'd hear from an American president. And, of course, there's also been during this trip a [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=286.8s)]
*  notable about-face on U.S. policy in Syria. Kelly, we now know the U.S. is planning to lift sanctions [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=292.64s)]
*  on that country. This president met with a new Syrian leader this morning. How did all that come [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=299.44s)]
*  about? Well, that was also a part of the influence of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=304.16s)]
*  president of Turkey, President Erdogan. The president, our president has spoken to those [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=311.12s)]
*  leaders and they exerted some influence on him to say that the Bashar al-Assad regime is over. It [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=316.24s)]
*  has been deposed. And now there's a new time and a new opportunity for the president to have a new [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=324.56s)]
*  relationship. And so he has said that he would agree to lift sanctions and is urging the new [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=333.76s)]
*  Syrian regime to look at some things that are important, like helping the United States [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=340.88s)]
*  prevent the rise of ISIS again, taking control of its own prisons there where the U.S. has had [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=346.96s)]
*  influence. It's a real shift. Here is a bit of how the president addressed the leader, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=353.36s)]
*  the new leader that he met briefly on the sidelines, as they say, back in Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=359.04s)]
*  A little difficult to hear there, at least it was for me, but he was describing the leader [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=363.76s)]
*  and talking about him as having an attractive future, being an attractive young man. And so [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=386.88s)]
*  that gives you a sense again of the personal quotient that President Trump puts into all of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=392.8s)]
*  these relationships. How does he interact with that leader? What is his relationship? And then [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=397.68s)]
*  by extension, what it means for the United States. Ana? The president did give quite a lot of credit [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=402.88s)]
*  to the Saudi crown prince for this shift on Syria. In fact, take a listen to what he said. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=408.24s)]
*  After discussing the situation in Syria with the crown prince, your crown prince, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=415.2s)]
*  and also with President Erdogan of Turkey, who called me the other day, I will be ordering [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=422.8s)]
*  the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at great things. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=433.44s)]
*  Oh, what I do for the crown prince. Ambassador, your reaction, what kind of influence might [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  MBS have had? Well, complete influence on this. This was not in the cards before this trip began, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=445.2s)]
*  and there's no doubt this was the type of quid pro quo. MBS wants to see, along with other Arab [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=452.4s)]
*  states, major efforts to try to reconcile the situation in Syria to avoid another Islamist [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=458.23999999999995s)]
*  upheaval in the country. And this is the best chance for those of us who follow the Middle East [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=464.79999999999995s)]
*  to give al-Shar the chance that he needs and getting a boost from the United States, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=469.52s)]
*  because it's not just the United States, but it's also the European Union that has also [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  the best little thing, sanctions. So he's getting a good dose of support from the Arab world, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=477.52s)]
*  the United States and Western Europe, and it's in our best interest to see him succeed. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=482.24s)]
*  So if it is in the U.S. best interest, it's still how do you square that then with the past, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  with this new president, Ahmed al-Sharah, who not long ago, the U.S. had a $10 million bounty on. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=494.0s)]
*  He fought against the U.S. as a bona fide member of al-Qaeda in Iraq. Do you see any risks to this [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=500.79999999999995s)]
*  shift in policy involving Syria, Ben? Yeah, there are risks, but look, I'm going to say [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=506.4s)]
*  this is the right call. I don't think that it was necessarily arrived at it for careful consideration. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=513.04s)]
*  The reality is the risks are if he ends up being an extremist leader, you can put those sanctions [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  back on. Having them in place when they're put in place to deal with Assad, having those sanctions [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=522.88s)]
*  in place would make it impossible for Syria to rebuild, impossible for anybody to invest a dollar [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=528.24s)]
*  in that country, impossible for people who are Syrians or in places like Europe who want to go [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=532.64s)]
*  home to get back there. So I think you have to try this. So I support this. The question, though, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=536.88s)]
*  is how do you make decisions in the White House? And the message of Trump is broadcasting. He's [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=542.56s)]
*  saying, like, I wasn't going to do this, and then MBS told me to do it. That's the problem. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=547.52s)]
*  The problem is you should have a national security council and a U.S. government that makes [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=552.56s)]
*  a process set up to make a decision like this. You don't tell the world, I'm doing this because [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=557.2s)]
*  this person who controls trillions of dollars of wealth just asked me to, and of course I'm going [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=563.44s)]
*  to do what he says. That's the wrong way to announce what I think is the right decision in this case. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=567.36s)]
*  Ben Rhodes, Ambassador Mark Ginsburg, thank you so much for your expertise, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=572.96s)]
*  for sharing your knowledge of the region and these matters with us. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=576.1600000000001s)]
*  Callie O'Donnell, thank you for the reporting. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=578.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdlOtosRMo&t=587.2s)]
