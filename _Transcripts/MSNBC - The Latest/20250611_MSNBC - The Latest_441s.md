# ‘Full-on assault on democracy’: California Dem. lawmaker slams Trump’s response to L.A. protests
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg)
*  And joining us now is Democratic Congresswoman Norma Torres of California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=0.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you. I want to start with how President Trump is framing the situation in LA. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=4.4s)]
*  Here's part of this speech that he gave in front of active-duty military at Fort Bragg yesterday. Listen. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=9.6s)]
*  What you're witnessing in California is a full-blown assault on peace, on public order, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=16.56s)]
*  and a national sovereignty carried out by rioters bearing foreign flags with the aim of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=22.64s)]
*  continuing a foreign invasion of our country. We're not going to let that happen. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  It is worth pointing out to our viewers that the unrest in the Los Angeles area is primarily [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=34.8s)]
*  happening in one square mile in a 500 square mile city. So what's your response to Trump's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=39.84s)]
*  claims? Does it track with the reality on the ground? Absolutely not. And good morning. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  It's really unfortunate that this is the kind of political and violent talk that is coming out of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=53.84s)]
*  the president of the United States. Look, what this is, is a full-on assault on the democracy [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  of the country, on our Constitution. The state of California and the city of Los Angeles have a right [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=69.76s)]
*  to be able to monitor their own incidents and handle their own incidents by the president [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=77.12s)]
*  inserting the military into what is a domestic, a local issue. And the reason why, let's not forget [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  why we are having problems in Los Angeles right now. Those problems came due to the large-scale [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  and violent confrontations of ICE agents in our community with migrant workers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=100.08s)]
*  We cannot forget who the people are that the president is attacking. These are the people that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=109.6s)]
*  are our child care providers. These are the people that are cleaning our hotel rooms, where these ICE [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=118.4s)]
*  agents, by the way, are staying. These are the people that are cooking our food. These are our [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=124.72s)]
*  nurses. These are our teachers, our school principals. So we have to look at the humanity [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=129.68s)]
*  of the people that the president is utilizing as a political prop to attack the politics of a state [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=135.76s)]
*  that did not vote for him and has rejected the radical Republican agenda of Project 2025. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=144.24s)]
*  We are reporting that the Marines who have been deployed could be used to provide security and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=153.36s)]
*  transportation for ICE personnel. Is that a role for the U.S. military in any scenario? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. military has no role in domestic affairs of this size. The U.S. military, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  these are warriors. These are our heroes that have fought battles abroad, not here in the community. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  The Los Angeles Police Department understands these groups better than anyone, better than anyone [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=181.52s)]
*  sitting in Washington, D.C., at the White House, or anywhere here in the U.S. Capitol. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=189.28s)]
*  They have been dealing with these groups for many, many years. The complexity of the city [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  is something that is unmanageable for people living outside of Los Angeles. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=202.88s)]
*  Look, we have groups from all over the world, immigrants that are now calling Los Angeles their [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=210.24s)]
*  home. Different people, different agendas. And what we need is to calm the temperature, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=217.84s)]
*  calm everyone's egos, and allow the local officials, the nonprofit organizations, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  the religious groups to be able to talk to the violent anarchists, to the violent [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=233.36s)]
*  rioters that have taken over for right now the plight of these immigrant groups that need to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=239.68s)]
*  be seen and need to be heard because they have been ignored for too long, not just in their [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=247.36s)]
*  communities but here in Congress with our failure to pass immigration reform. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=253.12s)]
*  That is a huge, thorny issue. As we know, it's been tried for multiple administrations, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=258.88s)]
*  decades and decades. Comprehensive immigration reform always ends in a failure or a non-answer, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=266.24s)]
*  a non-bill. ICE has picked up their efforts. We know there's been the workplace raids there, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=272.88s)]
*  but we're also getting concrete evidence and reporting about how they're really targeting [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=278.56s)]
*  people who show up for their immigration proceedings, who go to the courts to do the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=284.64s)]
*  check-ins and to make sure that they're following the rules. You've called what ICE is doing a shell [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=288.8s)]
*  game as we've reported on them moving detainees from facility to facility. They've blocked access [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=294.96s)]
*  to lawyers and family members. Are immigrants in your district afraid now to check in and to follow [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  the normal immigration protocols as a result? Is this driving people into the shadows? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=307.44s)]
*  Absolutely, and this is what we don't want. We want people to be registered. We want people [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=312.56s)]
*  to show up to their court dates to check in with immigration, their immigration contacts. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=319.04s)]
*  But that is right now, everyone is so afraid and it is being threatened. This is the rule of law [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=326.72s)]
*  that is being threatened when the president utilizes immigration as a political football. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=332.88s)]
*  We need these workers, not just in California, but our country needs these workers in order for [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=339.12s)]
*  our economy to continue to grow and expand. Do you think Republicans agree with you on that? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=346.56s)]
*  I think that they understand that this is what's happening. I hope the chambers of Congress, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=354.56s)]
*  I hope that the National Chamber of Commerce is engaged with them on this issue because [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=359.2s)]
*  it is their businesses that are going to be hurt. But all of this is collapsing while the president [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=365.84s)]
*  is playing politics with tariffs, while he is poking our friends abroad, while he is hosting [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  our enemies and other dictators, global dictators that have violated human rights and have violated [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=385.11999999999995s)]
*  the basic rule of law in these other countries. This president is adopting himself to that, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=394.96s)]
*  and the entire country and the United States needs to stand alert and we need to speak out. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=402.56s)]
*  We cannot be silenced on this. It is our democracy that is on the line. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=409.52s)]
*  Congresswoman, I appreciate your time. Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KROKkjLCHNg&t=414.4s)]
