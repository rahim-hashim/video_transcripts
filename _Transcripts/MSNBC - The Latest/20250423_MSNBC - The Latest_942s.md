# Oops!: Trump's first 100 days marked by incompetent screw-ups and frantic walk backs
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA)
*  And if there is something to learn about what Trump in power is going to be like, I think [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=0.0s)]
*  the first 100 days have given us one very clear lesson, right? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  We know he's trying for the whole dictator thing, you know, no elections, no courts, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=10.92s)]
*  no resistance, rule by terror, right? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=14.8s)]
*  We know that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=16.38s)]
*  We know the people of this country aren't having it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=17.38s)]
*  But I think what we should also know, what we have just lived through in this first 90-plus [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=19.06s)]
*  days thus far, is him screwing up. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=22.56s)]
*  It's him absolutely blowing it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=28.12s)]
*  I mean, it is one thing to understand the gravity of his intentions, but I think it [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=30.44s)]
*  is equally important to recognize that he's really bad at everything he tries to do. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=34.68s)]
*  I don't know if he's bad at good stuff he tries to do, because he's not trying to do [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=40.32s)]
*  much that seems good. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=43.28s)]
*  But the bad stuff he's trying to do, he's been real bad at that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=45.16s)]
*  I mean, it hasn't been funny exactly. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=48.64s)]
*  It's too disgusting for that, but it has been the proverbial comedy of errors. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=51.56s)]
*  Let me show you what I mean. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=56.8s)]
*  Do you remember the first big surprise destroy the government thing that he did right after [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=57.8s)]
*  the inauguration? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=63.68s)]
*  He sent out a White House memo ordering the freezing of all federal funding, all federal [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=64.72s)]
*  grants. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=69.8s)]
*  And then less than 48 hours, oops, had to take that back. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=72.32s)]
*  Headline, Trump White House rescinds memo freezing federal grants after widespread confusion [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=76.28s)]
*  and legal challenges. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=81.8s)]
*  Quote, President Donald Trump's budget office on Wednesday rescinded a memo freezing spending [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=83.04s)]
*  on federal grants less than two days after it sparked widespread confusion and legal [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  challenges across the country. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  The Monday evening memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget sparked uncertainty [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=95.76s)]
*  and left the White House scrambling to explain what would and wouldn't be subject to a pause [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  in funding. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=105.2s)]
*  So it was kind of the first big thing he did, and then they immediately had to take that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=106.2s)]
*  back. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=110.68s)]
*  Did we say freeze federal funding? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=112.56s)]
*  We didn't. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  We're just going to. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  That's rescinded. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  We'll try that again. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  Right out of the gate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=119.84s)]
*  And then right on the heels of that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  Remember this one? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  When they accidentally put somebody in charge of the FBI who they didn't mean to? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=124.36000000000001s)]
*  Quote, White House officials goofed on the White House website. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=128.36s)]
*  You don't see the word goofed in the Wall Street Journal all that often. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=131.76000000000002s)]
*  White House officials goofed on the White House website and listed the wrong man in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=135.32s)]
*  charge of the FBI. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=139.48s)]
*  People familiar with the matter said instead of correcting the error, White House officials [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=141.0s)]
*  let it stand. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  And the two men traded temporary titles at the FBI. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  So they, oops, accidentally put the wrong person as the acting head of the FBI, mixed [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  up the names. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=158.2s)]
*  We didn't mean to put you in there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=159.2s)]
*  Oh, oh, well, who cares? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=160.44s)]
*  We'll just let the other guy we didn't mean to put in charge of the FBI be in charge of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=163.04s)]
*  the FBI. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  What could possibly go wrong? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  Immediately after that, oops, turns out they accidentally put the names of hundreds of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=169.12s)]
*  CIA officers in an unclassified email and sent it to the White House, where things like [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=174.0s)]
*  that just kind of happen now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=180.84s)]
*  That same day, we learned that Trump has accidentally made it impossible for the Postal Service [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=182.70000000000002s)]
*  to accept mail from China. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=187.08s)]
*  Oops. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=189.6s)]
*  Trump made an announcement about shipping things from China. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=190.6s)]
*  He had no idea, apparently, what the implications of that announcement would be. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=193.28s)]
*  Then the Post Office announced, based on what you said, sir, this means America can no longer [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=196.6s)]
*  receive mail from China. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=202.92s)]
*  And well, I'm not exactly sure what he did mean, but that wasn't what he meant. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=205.6s)]
*  So oops, that had to be reversed, too. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  By then, the president's top campaign donor was working his bizarre magic in Washington. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=212.46s)]
*  So we got the accidental firing of the National Nuclear Security Agency, which handles the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=217.6s)]
*  Safe Transportation Storage, Assembly and Dismantling of our nation's nuclear weapons. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=222.6s)]
*  Oops. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  Oops. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  We didn't mean to do that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=229.24s)]
*  Oops. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=230.24s)]
*  Trump administration fires and then tries to rehire nuclear weapons workers in Doge [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=231.72s)]
*  reversal. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=236.88s)]
*  Then this was the very next day. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=237.88s)]
*  Headline, New York Times. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=241.0s)]
*  Doge claimed it saved $8 billion in one contract. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=242.88s)]
*  It was actually $8 million. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=246.7s)]
*  So that's cool. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=250.76s)]
*  It's off by roughly 100,000 percent. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=251.92s)]
*  But you know, don't forget, these are the smart guys, smart kids. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=256.56s)]
*  Next day, headline, Agriculture Department tries to rehire fired workers tied to bird [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=261.96s)]
*  flu response. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=266.8s)]
*  Oops. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=268.0s)]
*  We accidentally fired all the bird flu people in the middle of the bird flu. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=269.0s)]
*  Oops. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=273.8s)]
*  Can we get them back? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=275.24s)]
*  No? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=276.24s)]
*  No, we can't. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=277.24s)]
*  That same day. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=279.44s)]
*  Headline, Trump administration reverses plan to end free covid test program. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  The taxpayers bought all these covid tests, perfectly good covid tests. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=286.16s)]
*  They're still covid. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=289.76s)]
*  People are still testing for covid to see if they have covid. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=291.12s)]
*  But because the Trump administration doesn't like covid, they're going to what? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=293.68s)]
*  Incinerate millions of tests of perfectly good tests. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=299.36s)]
*  So Americans instead have to buy more of them by paying for themselves instead of getting [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=303.86s)]
*  the free ones the government already bought to hand out. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=309.72s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=312.12s)]
*  No, not seriously. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=313.12s)]
*  Reverse that one, too. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=314.12s)]
*  This was also that same day. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=315.72s)]
*  This is a big day in Oopsville. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=317.14000000000004s)]
*  Headline, Trump administration reverses its previous decision and reinstates legal aid [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=319.32000000000005s)]
*  for migrant children. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=324.8s)]
*  Yeah, turns out babies don't make great lawyers. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=326.68s)]
*  Doesn't work out great to have literally babies and toddlers appearing in court alone with [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=332.0s)]
*  a judge like asking them questions. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=338.04s)]
*  I said, all rise, baby. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=341.64000000000004s)]
*  Are you able to stand on your own? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  Oh, actually, sorry. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=346.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, they reversed that, too. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=348.32s)]
*  They have since tried again to take away the lawyers for babies and little kids in court [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=350.16s)]
*  after this initial reversal. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=354.86s)]
*  So this one actually remains a live issue. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=356.82000000000005s)]
*  I don't know if that's better. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=359.0s)]
*  Two days later, oops, we accidentally cut the program that helps the 9-11 first responders. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=362.84s)]
*  Did we mean to do that? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=369.52s)]
*  I think we did mean to do that, but we certainly can't defend it now that people are asking [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=370.52s)]
*  us to defend it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=375.0s)]
*  So that one gets reversed, too. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=376.0s)]
*  Then Trump's top campaign donor, Elon Musk, tries on the federal government the same thing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  he did to destroy the company Twitter. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=384.05999999999995s)]
*  He sends out the what did you do last week email insisting that anybody who doesn't immediately [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=386.88s)]
*  respond to that email will instantly be fired from the federal government. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=391.96s)]
*  No exceptions. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=395.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=397.08s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=398.08s)]
*  No, not really, and definitely not seriously. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=399.08s)]
*  Headline, federal agencies can't ignore what did you do last week email, Trump administration [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA&t=403.68s)]
