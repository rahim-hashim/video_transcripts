# Market turmoil: Dow falls in reaction to Israeli attack on Iran
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q)
*  Now we're going to turn to more breaking news. The market's down this morning in the wake of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's strikes on Iran and renewed fears of a broader regional war after Iran's nuclear sites [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=4.72s)]
*  were targeted. You can see the Dow now down 661 points. Joining us now is NBC News senior [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=10.64s)]
*  business correspondent Christine Romans. What are the big takeaways emerging here? Which markets [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=16.32s)]
*  are we watching specifically? Which sectors? Spiking oil markets here is the really big [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=20.8s)]
*  thing to watch. And you see the stock markets are near the lows of the day, but those oil [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=25.68s)]
*  prices up some 8%. A heightened geopolitical tensions never good for the oil market. And what's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  so fascinating, it's been lower energy prices that have helped keep a lid on inflation. So now you have [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=35.68s)]
*  flaring tensions in the Middle East kind of threatening to undo some of the good news we've [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=42.32s)]
*  heard in the last few days on the inflation story. A stock's here down to the Dow, down about 600 [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=46.8s)]
*  points. And this is again coming off of a pretty decent run from those April lows on tariff years. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=52.64s)]
*  Now you have more geopolitical tensions, a new kind of worry to put in a basket of international [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=58.8s)]
*  worries. And so that's what you're seeing, a kind of a classic response in the markets to geopolitical [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=65.6s)]
*  concerns. I mean, this is uncertainty stacked upon uncertainty here. What will you be watching in the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=70.56s)]
*  next few days? What's so fascinating to me is we just got a reading on the consumer that was [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=76.08s)]
*  actually better than expected. Remember how sour people were saying they felt in May and in April [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=80.0s)]
*  because of tariff worries? Well, actually people were starting to feel a little bit better because [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=85.44s)]
*  the president had backed off of some of the worst of his threats. Now you have a new concern added [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=89.28s)]
*  into this picture with rising oil prices. So I'll be watching oil prices. Do they stay at these lofty [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=94.88s)]
*  levels? And how quickly does that feed into maybe higher inflation for consumers in the days and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=100.96s)]
*  weeks ahead? And of course, I think oil prices, meaning gas prices are something to watch as well. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=106.08s)]
*  And we know that the gas prices have been going down, which has been nice for a lot of us. Thank [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=111.6s)]
*  you so much, Christine, for keeping us updated. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVpL4REv-Q&t=116.08s)]
