**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY)
*  You know John Carney's victory was also dubbed the 51st state win [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=0.0s)]
*  Obviously handed to him by by Donald Trump [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=6.08s)]
*  What does it mean when one of our closest allies and I have to say even knowing everything I know [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=8.28s)]
*  I thought that victory speech was [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=13.64s)]
*  Blunt to say the least when you say that our old relationship is over [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=17.16s)]
*  What what does that mean for us as a country? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  It is remarkable, you know, there's an old New Republic [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=27.959999999999997s)]
*  Contest for the most boring headline ever written and their nominee was worthwhile Canadian initiative [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=32.6s)]
*  We are way beyond that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=40.0s)]
*  I think that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=42.48s)]
*  When in fact you alienate Canada [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  You have crossed a certain kind of Rubicon to mix a bunch of metaphors [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=48.36s)]
*  The order since 1945 the global order has been one in which as Franklin Roosevelt said in the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=53.72s)]
*  last weeks of his life and a world in which [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=62.24s)]
*  the only way to have a friend is to be one and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=66.28s)]
*  What we've seen I think with the when people have pulled apart the tariffs and I remember being struck last night [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=70.8s)]
*  Seeing the headline about Trump has planned to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=77.56s)]
*  As if the tariffs had come in from outer space, right? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=80.88s)]
*  I mean, so he's creating a rescue plan for his own thing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=84.28s)]
*  I think that it's and I what's important at a hundred-day mark [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  What's important as a test of citizenship is for? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  Citizens to really think about what does rhetoric that seems entertaining [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  That may seem appealing which is what a lot of folks who support the president [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=103.72s)]
*  thrilled to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=108.4s)]
*  Where does that rhetoric hit reality and reality is what we have to deal with [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=110.4s)]
*  And let's talk about reality Elise because currently actually is going to host leaders from the g7 [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  Including Donald Trump in mid-june [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=121.36s)]
*  What's that going to look like and what will you be watching? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  I think that's a great question [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=126.76s)]
*  Donald Trump in mid-june [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=128.92s)]
*  What's that gonna look like and what will you be watching for I'm watching for is there gonna be an alliance within an alliance where? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=131.16s)]
*  Other members are essentially forming a block against Donald Trump to counter Donald Trump [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=138.64s)]
*  You see what Canadian voters just did and the referendum that they gave that they did not like Donald Trump's territorial aggression [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  I am interested to see though if we're actually going to have these sweeping tariffs by mid-june [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=150.92s)]
*  Is he gonna backtrack the uncertainty no one knows at all and I guess it's like a big-picture thought in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=156.76s)]
*  Contrast to the other wave elections we saw around the globe where the existing political order got knocked out of power [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=163.28s)]
*  You had liberals managing to hold on to power despite their unpopularity [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=170.76s)]
*  Just because of Donald Trump and he was the conservatives are in a really tough position because their base like Donald Trump [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=176.24s)]
*  They couldn't attack him too much and so they were tepid it almost reminds me of the conundrum Democrats were in when they didn't want to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=183.16s)]
*  Alienate their progressive base [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=189.68s)]
*  In the election with Biden and Trump and Kamala Harris and I think it's important to point out John that this is much bigger than [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=191.84s)]
*  Canada right I just want to remind folks of one key moment as if anybody needs reminding [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=198.08s)]
*  The attack on a leader who stood against the odds for democracy Volodymyr Zelensky listen [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=204.4s)]
*  You're right now not in a very good position [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=213.52s)]
*  You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position and he's happens to be right about from the very beginning of the war [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=216.0s)]
*  You're not in a good position. I was you don't have the cards right now with us you start having [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=222.0s)]
*  We're not playing cards that got cut there [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=228.16s)]
*  But that's what he said and the New York Times put it this way in mr [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=230.36s)]
*  Trump's view the world is divided into two kinds of countries those that have the cards and those that don't [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  John do his actions suggest whether it's taking over Greenland or slapping tariffs on everyone from the EU to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=241.72s)]
*  To places that don't even trade with the US because humans don't live there [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=248.76s)]
*  That in in Trump's worldview only the US holds the cards. What are the implications of that and that view? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=253.64s)]
*  Well, the danger is that if you want to be [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=262.92s)]
*  An autocrat if you want to be both autocratic as a president if you want to try to create a country that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=266.68s)]
*  dictates to other people [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=273.48s)]
*  It has what it has an impact and the impact is what you just saw in Canada, which is guess what? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=275.24s)]
*  Human nature is such that people don't like being bullied surprise surprise, right? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=282.52s)]
*  I mean, this is all kind of kindergarten writ large [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, you don't push people around out of fear that you might someday get pushed around [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=291.16s)]
*  And so I think this is an example and I would think this as a biographer [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=296.68s)]
*  But this is a case where individual human character and that is the president's character and his tendencies [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=302.04s)]
*  Are having an immense impact on the lives of billions [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  and one of the things that I think is [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=315.0s)]
*  Heartening at this hour is that so many Americans seem to be registering unease with this [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=317.56s)]
*  Americans [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=325.54s)]
*  Actually are pretty decent folks [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=327.08s)]
*  And it's sort of like what Churchill said about you can always count on the Americans do the right thing once they've exhausted every other [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=330.92s)]
*  Possibility and I think we've pretty much I think at the end of 100 days [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=337.86s)]
*  I think we're reaching a point where if in fact there will be pushback against the excessive autocracy [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=343.24s)]
*  Autocratic tendencies of this president. I think you're going to begin to see it. And if you don't [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=349.86s)]
*  That's a remarkable thing [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=355.8s)]
*  It's interesting that one of the places standing up to donald trump is not [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=357.8s)]
*  Democracy, right? China has said oh no [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=362.12s)]
*  We're holding cards as well if we're going to use that analogy of of this is some sort of incredibly high stakes game [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=366.84s)]
*  Do you think that more and more countries will get emboldened including by what they see in canada to stand up and say no? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=375.0s)]
*  The problem with it is exactly that they are going to stand up and they're going to figure out new trade partners [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=384.04s)]
*  They're going to figure out new regulations [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=390.52s)]
*  They're going to figure out how to circumvent these insane tariffs on them and that the u.s [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=392.84s)]
*  Taxpayers also will have to swallow as yet another tax [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=398.26s)]
*  This is remaking the economic order of the world, but it's not keeping america's dominant position [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=402.52s)]
*  And that is something that I do not know if it's going to be easy to recover john meacham alice jordan [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=408.76s)]
*  It's great to have both of you here. You psyched about this weekend alice very excited because beginning this saturday [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjFtUBAsxY&t=414.44s)]
