# How a case makes it to the Supreme Court
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA)
*  You may have heard that the Supreme Court preserved a ban on religious charter schools last week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=0.0s)]
*  It was a controversial case, one from which Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=5.0s)]
*  over whether religious schools could receive public funds. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  The Supreme Court upheld the decision from the Oklahoma State Supreme Court that religious schools could not receive public funds, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  and it did so with a single sentence, quote, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=20.0s)]
*  the judgment is affirmed by an equally divided court, end quote. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Now, none of the usual majority or dissenting opinions because there was no majority in this case. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=28.2s)]
*  The vote was deadlocked at 4-4, and when that happens in the Supreme Court, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=33.9s)]
*  the decision that the lower court arrived at stands. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=38.2s)]
*  It's not the only Supreme Court decision to have an odd procedural element to it recently. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=42.2s)]
*  The Trump administration's flurry of executive actions and the various legal challenges against them [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=46.0s)]
*  have piled up on the Supreme Court's emergency docket. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=51.1s)]
*  So let's explain the different kinds of decisions that come out of the highest court in the land and what each of them mean. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=54.0s)]
*  The most straightforward path for a case to get to the Supreme Court is for a plaintiff in a case to appeal the decision that was made by a lower court. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  Let's take, for example, the recent Supreme Court decision to uphold the Biden administration rules [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=68.4s)]
*  regulating and restricting the sale of ghost guns, firearm-making kits available online that people can assemble at home. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=73.1s)]
*  Well, gun rights advocates challenged the gun restrictions in a lower court, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=80.1s)]
*  and they sued in a federal court in Texas to block the ruling. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=84.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, then the federal or district judge in Texas made a ruling agreeing with the gun rights advocates [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=89.6s)]
*  and issuing an order to block the restrictions nationwide. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=94.89999999999999s)]
*  Now, when that decision was appealed, the Court of Appeals in the Fifth Circuit, which includes Texas, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=98.5s)]
*  upheld that lower court's decision to block those decisions, block the restrictions. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=104.0s)]
*  In early 2024, then Attorney General Merrick Garland asked the Supreme Court to take up the case, which the Supreme Court agreed to do. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=110.30000000000001s)]
*  The DOJ often asks the Supreme Court to take up cases. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=118.5s)]
*  Now, if received written and oral arguments from both sides, and the court released a full ruling, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=122.30000000000001s)]
*  reversing the appeals court's ruling and upholding the Biden-era regulations on the sale of ghost guns. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=130.3s)]
*  The majority released a written opinion, and justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito both wrote dissents. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=136.3s)]
*  Now, that's generally how a normal Supreme Court case works. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=142.4s)]
*  However, outside the normal docket of cases, the court chooses to take up each term. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  There's something called an emergency or shadow docket. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=150.0s)]
*  These are cases which are fast-tracked to the Supreme Court without the traditional decision and appeal process. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=152.9s)]
*  If the court deems that one party might suffer irreparable harm as a result of the law being upheld. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=158.3s)]
*  The Trump administration has currently got five cases on its emergency docket, unusually high in the court's history. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  Cases on the emergency docket do not get the traditional Supreme Court treatment. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=170.5s)]
*  There are typically no oral arguments, and the timeline for decision-making is much shorter. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=174.9s)]
*  Now, decisions in the emergency docket cases are often what the court calls per curiam. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=179.5s)]
*  These are unsigned shorter decisions. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  The direct Latin translation is by the court, but don't let that imply that these are unanimous decisions. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=187.3s)]
*  It's just typical for quickly resolved cases to be treated this way. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=193.3s)]
*  In April, the Supreme Court put a per curiam hold on an order by a federal or district judge that would have reinstated federal education grants that had been cut off by the Trump administration. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=197.70000000000002s)]
*  This wasn't a case that worked through the normal process. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  It was on the emergency docket, though the decision was unsigned. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=210.70000000000002s)]
*  What we do know is that three justices dissented. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=214.7s)]
*  Then there are administrative stays, like a pause on a law. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=217.6s)]
*  We've got a fresh example of one of those, too. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=221.5s)]
*  On Friday, Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily shielded Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from freedom of information requests by granting an administrative stay. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  So these are just a few of the different flavors of a Supreme Court decision. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840f2hxFumA&t=234.0s)]
