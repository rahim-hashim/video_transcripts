Video Description: The Trump Administration claims to be pro-family. It reportedly wants to offer a $5,000 baby bonus to women who give birth. President Trump has called himself the “father of IVF” and the “fertilization president”. Project 2025 included a chapter stipulating that government policies should, quote, “restore the family as the centerpiece of American life.” At the same time, the administration is enacting policies that make parenthood, pregnancy and family planning more difficult…and even dangerous.

# Velshi: Trump wants women to have more babies, but won’t help once the babies are born
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc)
*  Happy Mother's Day. Last year, Americans spent an estimated $3.2 billion on flowers for Mother's Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=0.0s)]
*  That's according to 1-800-Flowers. A beautiful bouquet of daisies, roses, maybe peonies I hear there in bloom right about now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=8.0s)]
*  What's the least we can do for the mothers in our lives? Or is it? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=15.0s)]
*  While flowers are a nice touch, maybe what mothers really need is safety, security, and a government that actually addresses their needs. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=19.0s)]
*  According to a survey by the Institute for Women's Policy Research, American mothers want policy solutions for child care, leave, and jobs. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=26.0s)]
*  63% of mothers are very or somewhat worried about having enough income to pay for the family's bills. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=35.0s)]
*  55.4% of mothers are either very or somewhat worried about having affordable and secure health insurance. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=41.0s)]
*  And 70% of mothers support paid leave for work. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=48.0s)]
*  This survey was done back in 2021. I feel comfortable assuming mothers still, generally speaking, feel this way. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=52.0s)]
*  Maybe these numbers are even higher at this point. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=58.0s)]
*  Because nearly four years later, we're being governed by an administration that's actively made it harder to be a mother in this country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=61.0s)]
*  The Trump administration claims to be pro-family. How so? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=67.0s)]
*  Well, it reportedly wants to offer a $5,000 baby bonus to women who give birth. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=72.0s)]
*  President Trump has called himself the father of IVF and the fertilization president. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=77.0s)]
*  Project 2025, the conservative playbook that ushered in many of the policies that Trump is activating in America, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=84.0s)]
*  included an entire chapter stipulating government policies should, quote, restore the family as the centerpiece of American life. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=90.0s)]
*  Women are practically begging for things like paid family leave, financial assistance, universal health care. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=97.0s)]
*  And what is Trump reportedly considering doing instead? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=102.0s)]
*  I'm not kidding. A national medal of motherhood for mothers with six or more children. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=105.0s)]
*  It seems that the Trump administration's idea of family first boils down to persuading women to have more babies. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=110.0s)]
*  But President Trump has demonstrated that he has no interest in helping parents care for those babies once they're born. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=116.0s)]
*  There are policy solutions readily available, but this administration is not only overlooking them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=122.0s)]
*  It's going out of its way to make parenthood, pregnancy, and family planning more difficult and more dangerous. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=127.0s)]
*  In less than four months since Donald Trump returned to power, he has withheld more than $65 million in Title X funding, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=133.0s)]
*  which provides money to community clinics like Planned Parenthood. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=140.0s)]
*  This means women, pregnant people, mothers could lose crucial health care like birth control, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=144.0s)]
*  infertility services, testing and treatment for STIs, breast and cervical cancer screenings, HPV vaccinations, and much more. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=149.0s)]
*  He's blocked or delayed billions of dollars in funding for things like school meals and school safety. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=158.0s)]
*  That's according to ProPublica. His proposed budget cut would take $4.5 million from four to 12 schools. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=163.0s)]
*  That new GOP proposal includes federal spending cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=170.0s)]
*  That SNAP used to be food stamps. Provides food assistance to about one in five children in America. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=176.0s)]
*  One week after dubbing himself the Fertilization President, ooh again, he eliminated the CDC's IVF team. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=183.0s)]
*  Make that make sense. His new tariffs will undoubtedly make life way more expensive for parents who need to buy baby formula, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=192.0s)]
*  diapers, car seats, as he says, strollers, and dolls. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=199.0s)]
*  The administration has arrested, jailed, and deported mothers, breaking up families, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=204.0s)]
*  and leaving children as young as four years old to face immigration judges without their parents. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=208.0s)]
*  The administration has scrubbed information on reproductive health from government websites. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=213.0s)]
*  The maternal mortality rate in America defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of a pregnancy has been on the rise in recent years. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=217.0s)]
*  It's actually three times as high as most other high income countries, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=227.0s)]
*  making it more dangerous to give birth in America than in most other developed nations. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=232.0s)]
*  It's even more dangerous for black women, by the way, and studies show that the maternal mortality rate is even higher in states that have abortion restrictions. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=237.0s)]
*  Women are dying and it's a direct consequence of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which President Trump proudly takes credit for. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=246.0s)]
*  And if they're not dying, they're facing life threatening, life altering health complications because of draconian abortion laws. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=252.0s)]
*  After Texas banned abortion in 2021, the rate of sepsis shot up more than 50 percent for women hospitalized when they lost their pregnancies in the second trimester. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=259.0s)]
*  That's according to ProPublica. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=269.0s)]
*  ProPublica previously reported last year about at least five women who died as a result of not receiving emergency abortion care in states that have abortion restrictions. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=271.0s)]
*  Separately, the Trump administration is endangering the right to life saving abortion care in emergency rooms. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=281.0s)]
*  In March, the DOJ dropped a case that sought to protect the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, EMTALA. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=288.0s)]
*  EMTALA requires hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment to all patients who have emergency medical conditions, including life saving abortion care. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=295.0s)]
*  So as the Center for Reproductive Rights notes, if you have a severe pregnancy complication in one of the dozen states banning abortion, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=305.0s)]
*  President Trump has given the hospital emergency room a green light to ignore this federal law. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=312.0s)]
*  You hear and see all of it, and you wonder why women aren't having more kids in this country. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=318.0s)]
*  Actions speak louder than words. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=324.0s)]
*  You can't claim to be pro-family while enacting policies that burden women, mothers, single mothers, working mothers, and any person who wants to become a mother at any point in the future. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=326.0s)]
*  You just can't have it both ways. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZCRLjeYFc&t=335.0s)]
