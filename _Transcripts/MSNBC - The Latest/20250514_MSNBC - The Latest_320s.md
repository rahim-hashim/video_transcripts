# DHS Secretary Noem dodges questions on due process
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU)
*  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem testified before Congress today defending the administration's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=0.0s)]
*  biggest immigration controversies. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  She agreed that current conditions in the country could justify calls to suspend habeas [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=9.78s)]
*  corpus. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  And she also said this when pressed about due process in the administration's deportation [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  efforts. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=19.96s)]
*  Well, Congresswoman, we are following due process and using it as to how Congress has [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=20.96s)]
*  laid out to us in statute and we are complying with all federal judges orders as well. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=26.8s)]
*  Well, you didn't, you weren't complying at that time. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  It took the United States Supreme Court to order you to comply. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=33.64s)]
*  So you hadn't proactively complied on your own. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=36.72s)]
*  You were intending to wrongfully deport people without access to a court hearing, without [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=39.36s)]
*  access to the rule of law. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  And that is why it was necessary for the United States Supreme Court, most of who. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=45.18s)]
*  Harry Littman joins me now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=52.88s)]
*  He's a former U.S. attorney and former deputy assistant attorney general. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=54.4s)]
*  The panel is also still with us. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=58.08s)]
*  Okay, Harry, I'm going to start with you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=59.56s)]
*  First of all, is that how due process really works? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  She just made two stunning misstatements. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=67.48s)]
*  First of all, that there's suspension here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=71.4s)]
*  You can only suspend habeas corpus. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=74.56s)]
*  Only Congress can do it and the public safety must require it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=77.6s)]
*  And by public safety requiring it, what we mean is if courts were to actually hear the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=81.44s)]
*  claims, that would be a problem for public safety. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=86.12s)]
*  There's no possible argument here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=89.0s)]
*  We're talking about detainees who are already detained. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  Second, no, it is, it's completely wrong to say due process is whatever we say and without [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=94.96s)]
*  the intervention of court. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=103.0s)]
*  Due process is necessarily nine zip. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=104.08s)]
*  The Supreme Court has reaffirmed a judicial hearing notice, an opportunity to be heard [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=107.32s)]
*  before a neutral decision maker, not the say so of the very gang that's trying to deport [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=112.72s)]
*  you to dramatically incorrect statements of the law there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  You know, due process shows up twice actually in the Constitution in the 14th Amendment, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=125.52s)]
*  I believe, also in the Fifth Amendment. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  The other thing that's in the Constitution, which is why it's such a big deal, is habeas [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=132.24s)]
*  corpus. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=135.48s)]
*  This is what the Constitution says. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=136.64s)]
*  It says the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=137.64s)]
*  in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  It also makes clear that Congress holds the power. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=146.48s)]
*  So what could the White House be looking at? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=148.67999999999998s)]
*  If Congress holds the power, what could they be looking at? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=153.44s)]
*  But also, what exactly is habeas corpus? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=155.44s)]
*  Because it seems like all these terms are being thrown around and folks at home should [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=158.06s)]
*  understand what we're talking about. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=161.28s)]
*  Yeah, I know it seems kind of legally complex, but it's so fundamental to the framers. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=162.72s)]
*  They made it this whole special clause. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  And as you say, they put in Article 1, meaning this is up to Congress. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=170.2s)]
*  All it is is an ability, if the executive comes and detains you, to be able to go to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=173.68s)]
*  a court and say, bring me the body, habeas corpus. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=179.7s)]
*  In other words, it's a defense to the courts, always to the courts, against a detention [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=183.64s)]
*  without law, exactly what the administration is doing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=189.86s)]
*  So it's down the middle. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=193.78s)]
*  And to suspend it, you must have Congress and you must have public safety threatened, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=195.24s)]
*  which the courts have to find. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=200.54000000000002s)]
*  It's not enough to say, oh, these trendy Aragwa bandits are dangerous people. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=202.62s)]
*  It has to be dangerous for courts to hear their claims. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=208.94000000000003s)]
*  And that's just completely unshowable here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  This is not going to fly, Simone. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=218.84s)]
*  The courts will not permit the suspension. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=221.76s)]
*  You know, Sam, I'm wondering what you thought of Secretary Noem's testimony today. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=224.12s)]
*  The Democrats were, I think, quite aggressive in their questioning, which I was—you know, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=230.66s)]
*  it's night and day from the first hearings that we saw coming out of right after Donald [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=235.68s)]
*  Trump's inauguration and now about 115 days later. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=239.76s)]
*  So what you thought about that? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=243.2s)]
*  And then the courts are holding strong on this notion. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=244.8s)]
*  But the deportations are still continuing to happen. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=248.5s)]
*  So how does this not have a chilling effect? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=251.54s)]
*  Well, let's start with your first observation about the night and day, which I think is [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=253.5s)]
*  really understated, because if you remember right after the inauguration, the predominant [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=256.78s)]
*  conversation in Democratic circles was, how do we move to the right on immigration? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=261.9s)]
*  How can we accommodate Trumpism on immigration? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=265.26s)]
*  And they voted for legislation—or they had already voted for it—was signed by Trump [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=268.12s)]
*  to make that shift. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=272.41999999999996s)]
*  And now what you see is a much more aggressive pushback on what the administration is doing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=273.41999999999996s)]
*  I think that's partially because the administration has gone so aggressive themselves. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=277.74s)]
*  Two is, there's a fundamental contradiction to what the administration is arguing here, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=281.90000000000003s)]
*  which is, one, the border is secure, unlike any point in our history. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  Two, crime is down across the border in all the major cities. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=290.18s)]
*  And three, it's such an invasion that we have to suspend habeas corpus. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=293.26s)]
*  Those things cannot possibly coexist, and I think that is a problem for them. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBpaDXFGOU&t=296.66s)]
