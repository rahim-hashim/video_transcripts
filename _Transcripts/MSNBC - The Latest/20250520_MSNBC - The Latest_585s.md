# Trump's 'magical thinking': Budget bill will keep Medicaid 'exactly as it is'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI)
*  It is day 121 of the second Trump administration, and we are just hours away from the next hurdle [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=0.0s)]
*  for Trump's budget bill. The House Rules Committee is set to meet on it around 1 a.m. That's right, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=6.96s)]
*  1 a.m. This is a critical step to get the bill on the floor before the GOP's self-imposed deadline [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  on Thursday. But Republicans are still facing some pushback from within their party. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=20.0s)]
*  Earlier, President Trump went to Capitol Hill to try and convince some of the GOP holdouts. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=26.959999999999997s)]
*  Behind closed doors, he told them, quote, don't f around with Medicaid. And he told members pushing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=32.8s)]
*  for higher state and local tax deductions to, quote, unquote, let it go. Here's what he had to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=39.68s)]
*  say in front of the cameras. I think we have unbelievable unity. I think we're going to get [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  everything we want. The bill is, I think it's going to be one of the most important. It's the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=53.36s)]
*  biggest tax reduction in history, biggest regulation reduction in history, incredible [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=59.12s)]
*  for Medicaid, Medicare. The only thing we're going to leave it exactly as it was, other than [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=65.2s)]
*  for obviously waste fraud and abuse, we're strengthening it. We're going to make these [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=70.88s)]
*  things even stronger. It's incredible for Medicare and Medicaid. Quick fact check. Right now, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=75.52s)]
*  the bill actually makes cuts to Medicaid. That's how it achieves most of its cost savings. So in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=82.24s)]
*  fact, they are, quote, unquote, effing around with Medicaid. And the Congressional Budget Office [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=88.32s)]
*  estimates that more than 8 million Americans could lose their health coverage under this plan. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=93.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, New Jersey representative LaMonica McIver is gearing up for her day in court tomorrow. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=99.84s)]
*  The Justice Department has charged the Democratic congresswoman with two counts of assaulting [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=106.08s)]
*  immigration and customs agents outside a Newark detention facility. McIver has denied the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=110.4s)]
*  allegations and calls the indictment, quote, unquote, political intimidation. Here's what [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=116.0s)]
*  she had to say to MSNBC's Jen Psaki earlier this evening. Once again, showed up to do my job and I [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  don't need to apologize for doing that. That is what the people of New Jersey expect for me to do. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=128.32s)]
*  The 744,000, almost close to 800,000 people I represent. And why should we apologize about [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=132.8s)]
*  doing our job when ICE and Homeland Security created that environment and that atmosphere? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=139.44s)]
*  The complaint against McIver was filed by the interim U.S. attorney for the district of New [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=145.76s)]
*  Jersey, Alina Habba. And if that name sounds familiar to you viewers, it is because Habba [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=150.48s)]
*  is a Trump loyalist and a former member of the president's legal team. Also breaking tonight, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=156.48s)]
*  the Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation into former New York Governor Andrew [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=162.32s)]
*  Cuomo. This comes after House Republicans accused Cuomo of lying to Congress last year [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=168.0s)]
*  about his involvement in reviewing a report about New York State's handling of the COVID pandemic. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=173.6s)]
*  Cuomo is now a leading candidate for the New York City mayor's race. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=179.04s)]
*  With that, let's bring in our lead off panel. Luke Broadwater, the Pulitzer Prize winning [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=184.24s)]
*  White House correspondent is with us. Jeff Mason, the White House correspondent for Reuters is also [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=189.04s)]
*  here and Dave Weigel, political reporter for Semaphore. Luke, let me start with you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=193.6s)]
*  How did this closed door House GOP meeting with the president go? The president says it's all [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=198.88s)]
*  love, it's all unity. Is it as the president described it or is there more here? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=204.72s)]
*  Well, I do think President Trump made a positive impact on these negotiations in terms of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=210.0s)]
*  Republicans uniting. Obviously, the sort of right wing of the party and the center right wing of the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=215.76s)]
*  party have been at each other's throats over this legislation. The Freedom Caucus on one side saying [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=222.0s)]
*  they need much deeper cuts and sort of those moderate New York Republicans who want to see [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=228.64s)]
*  tax laws change to benefit their residents. You heard afterwards some of the Freedom Caucus [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=235.04s)]
*  members much more open to voting for this thing than they had been beforehand. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=242.0s)]
*  Whether or not that's in their political interest ultimately, I'll leave up to others to decide. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=247.12s)]
*  But it does seem like if there's one person who can sort of whip the House Republicans into shape [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=254.72s)]
*  out of their normal state of chaos, it is the president. Jeff, Luke just mentioned some of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=261.52s)]
*  those moderate New York representatives whose constituents are pushing for higher state and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=268.72s)]
*  local tax deductions. When the president met with them today, he told them to quote unquote let it go. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=273.92s)]
*  But they actually have to go back to their districts and meet with constituents who want [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=279.44s)]
*  this kind of tax relief. Does the president even care about what this means for them and for the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=283.92s)]
*  party in the midterms if they can't deliver on lower taxes? Well, I think he cares more about [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=288.88s)]
*  the big beautiful bill and he would argue that it's going to be lowering taxes with measures that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=294.8s)]
*  are in there already. The salt measures are kind of controversial with other parts of the party [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=300.88s)]
*  because they're focused primarily on blue states, but it's blue states, and this is I think why [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=307.28s)]
*  you're asking the question, where these Republican lawmakers who have one in their districts made [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=311.92s)]
*  promises to reverse it and their seats could hang on the line. And as we all know, the margin of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=317.2s)]
*  the Republican majority is very, very tight. So the midterm elections are still a ways away, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=324.4s)]
*  but those votes are going to be watched very closely once that next election comes around. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=330.32s)]
*  I will add to that, I also think that Democrats are probably preparing campaign ads right now [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=336.64s)]
*  based on what's going on with this bill. It's going to be very popular with some Republicans, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=344.0s)]
*  but the cuts that are being made to popular programs, including programs that help the poor [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=349.84s)]
*  and needy is kind of like writing an ad for the opposition party. Dave, the president says that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=355.76s)]
*  Medicaid will not be touched in this big beautiful bill, but in fact, cuts to Medicaid is actually [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=362.8s)]
*  how they are planning to pay for all of this. So what's behind the president's magical thinking? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=368.64s)]
*  What is he talking about? How are they actually going to improve Medicaid and Medicare if they're [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=374.24s)]
*  making these cuts? Right, the president said waste, fraud and abuse. It's not quite that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  They learned some lessons, Republicans, from eight years ago in the effort to repeal Obamacare. They [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  learned don't attack a program frontally and have a big number of people who are going to lose [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  coverage, especially people who vote in every election. They have focused on cuts that would [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=395.2s)]
*  add work requirements, which have not been terribly effective when implemented in states, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=400.23999999999995s)]
*  which would remove some people from their roles, and punishing states that have state health care [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=404.0s)]
*  plans funded in part by Medicare, Medicaid that go to non-citizens. And both of those are very, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=410.48s)]
*  Republicans are very comfortable running against. But the other thing they're doing differently from [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=416.56s)]
*  2017 is that they tried to repeal Obamacare first, then they moved to tax cuts. And by [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  bundling all this together, Jeff was talking about the confidence of Democrats, Democrats can say [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  and have said that they are cutting Medicaid, you're removing people from the system, at the same [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  time they're cutting taxes for the very wealthy, which politically is a place they like to be. And [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=435.76s)]
*  you talk to Democrats, they turn every conversation around to that storyline. But the reason Democrats [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=439.76s)]
*  you saw Don Bacon from Omaha saying this today, Omaha state that just elected, sorry, a city that [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  just elected Democratic mayor, it's been moving a bit to the left. He's very confident defending [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=449.52s)]
*  work requirements. So this is the policy part of this. Republicans are much more comfortable [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=453.12s)]
*  talking about than they were even a week ago. Luke, one of the things Republicans aren't as [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=457.92s)]
*  comfortable talking about is the impact of this bill on the deficit. In fact, Kentucky Congressman [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  Thomas Massey says he is a firm no on the bill because of the deficit. Trump says that Massey [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=466.96s)]
*  doesn't know anything about government and that he should be voted out of office. But Massey may [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=472.88s)]
*  know something because estimates show that this bill could add more than $3 trillion to the deficit [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=477.52s)]
*  over the next decade. So where are the other deficit hawks in the Republican Party on this issue? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=483.67999999999995s)]
*  And is this going to be the sticking point on this bill? Yeah, Thomas Massey is kind of an enigma in [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=490.08s)]
*  the modern day Congress. He is extremely smart. I don't think anybody would argue with that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=496.48s)]
*  He's an MIT guy. He's an inventor. But he's also the rare person who really votes on principle [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=502.08000000000004s)]
*  and votes based on their ideology. And he just is really opposed to deficit spending. He doesn't [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=510.32s)]
*  think we should run up the debt. And this bill, based on every independent analysis I've seen [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=515.2s)]
*  that doesn't come from the White House, raises the debt by several trillion dollars, some say [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=522.96s)]
*  three, four, five, depending on who you listen to. And he goes, you know, if you ever talk to Thomas [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=529.2800000000001s)]
*  Massey, he'll have charts and charts and show you all the different ways that this bill and other [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=536.32s)]
*  bills like it in the past have raised the debt to unacceptable levels for conservatives. The [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=542.4000000000001s)]
*  difference between him and the rest of the Republicans is he doesn't really care that he [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=549.04s)]
*  is standing on this principle in spite of Donald Trump. The rest of the party almost always [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=553.5999999999999s)]
*  goes along with what Donald Trump wants, even if it's against their stated principles. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfHXL8zpI&t=559.52s)]
