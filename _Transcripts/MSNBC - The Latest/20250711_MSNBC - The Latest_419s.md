# Wife of Texas AG Ken Paxton upends hot Senate race with divorce announcement
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k)
*  One of the most hotly contested Senate races in the country has just been upended by a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=0.0s)]
*  divorce. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  A statement from the wife of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton says she made the decision [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  on quote, biblical grounds listing adultery in her divorce petition. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=10.76s)]
*  It's also upping the pressure on President Trump, whose as yet unannounced endorsement [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=15.68s)]
*  will be pivotal in this race. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=20.04s)]
*  He is close to Paxton, a Magistar, but is on a plane right now with incumbent Senator [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=22.28s)]
*  John Cornyn. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=28.28s)]
*  The race that has divided Republicans has Democrats chomping at the bit to flip a seat [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=29.82s)]
*  in that red state. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  Joining us now, Jim Messina, former campaign manager for President Obama's 2012 reelection [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=36.5s)]
*  and CEO of the Messina Group. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=41.42s)]
*  Reid Galen is independent political strategist and co-founder of the Lincoln Project. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  So Reid, Paxton has been polling ahead of Senator Cornyn, but do you think this divorce [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  announcement could turn this into a more competitive race? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=53.3s)]
*  Well, that would only be if MAGA suddenly came back to some semblance of reality, which [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=57.74s)]
*  it suddenly has not. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=61.5s)]
*  And remember that this primary isn't until March of next year. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  But I would say that, you know, I saw some of the articles about this race and what it [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=67.3s)]
*  means for a Democratic matchup. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=72.22s)]
*  I was talking to a friend of mine in Republican circles who's seen private polling. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  I can see why even Donald Trump is having second thoughts about Paxton. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=78.18s)]
*  He's even dead, even with a generic Democrat in some of the things I've heard. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=82.78s)]
*  And so what I would say is that even though John Cornyn has done nothing of any note in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=86.74s)]
*  the 86 or so years he's been in the United States Senate, I think they'd rather have [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=91.46000000000001s)]
*  a reliable Republican vote than a very toxic guy who's been under federal indictment, who [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=95.18s)]
*  has fired all his staff, has been impeached and only his wife, I think, actually saved [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=101.62s)]
*  him from said impeachment. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=106.5s)]
*  So I think this is one where Trump would rather have a win than have a loyalist. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=108.04s)]
*  Yeah, she stood by him through that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=112.17999999999999s)]
*  But, Jim, Trump's Maggabase has frankly been a little bit unhappy with him lately. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=114.1s)]
*  Do you think that would push Trump to go for Paxton, maybe also because Trump was Teflon [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=119.14s)]
*  when his own personal history was questioned? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  Or do you think that somebody is going to get in his ear and say, listen, here's the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=128.3s)]
*  polls, just as we heard from Reid, he's weak against a Democrat. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=132.78s)]
*  You got to let him go. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=137.42s)]
*  Yeah, of course, Democrats love nothing more than a Republican food fight. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=138.46s)]
*  And that's exactly what we're getting in Texas. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=143.46s)]
*  And when you look at it, Ken Paxton is just the worst nightmare for the Republicans to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=146.18s)]
*  nominate. But to Reid's point, very smart point, he's up 19 points in the primary over [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=151.70000000000002s)]
*  Cornyn, who's clearly the better general election candidate, because Maggabase doesn't [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=158.06s)]
*  care about that stuff. They want people who give them red meat and tell them the things [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=161.74s)]
*  they want to hear. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=165.66s)]
*  You know, President Trump is in a difficult position. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=167.06s)]
*  He probably would like to have Cornyn, but he's saying to Cornyn, look, prove to me you [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=169.66s)]
*  can win. And so I'm sure that's why this story came out when it did, because people are [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=174.1s)]
*  attempting to put some blows on Paxton and his wife just decided to help. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=179.66s)]
*  And this is a very big deal in a general election. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  It's no longer a private matter between two people. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=188.06s)]
*  It's now a public referendum on his marriage and on who he is as a person. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=190.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's sort of the question I have, Reid. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=196.26000000000002s)]
*  In a statement, Paxton seemed to deflect blame away from himself and onto the media and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=198.82000000000002s)]
*  his political enemies, which raises a kind of fascinating set of questions whether Trump [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=204.18s)]
*  beating what was once a political character test can transfer to Paxton. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=210.62s)]
*  In other words, things that would have taken down previous candidates that are personal [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=215.86s)]
*  scandals or personal accusations didn't hurt Donald Trump. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=221.38s)]
*  Is that where we are as a country as a whole, where this type of scandal doesn't matter, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=227.01999999999998s)]
*  even in a Texas with a candidate who is run on being a strong Christian? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=231.46s)]
*  Or is that uniquely Donald Trump? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=236.1s)]
*  I think it's more uniquely Donald Trump than it is anything else. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=240.26s)]
*  He he is the leader of the movement. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=243.22s)]
*  The movement is his. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=245.46s)]
*  If they decided to endorse a Cornyn, you know, would it help? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=247.46s)]
*  It probably would. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=252.10000000000002s)]
*  Trump's endorsement. Remember, J.D. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=253.78s)]
*  Vance would not be vice president of the United States today if Trump had not endorsed him [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=255.9s)]
*  back when he was running for the United States Senate, which led to a one point primary [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=260.98s)]
*  victory against his opponent. So Trump does have the ability to move the electorate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  On the other hand, though, Chris, think about this is that if they had chosen a normal [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=269.18s)]
*  candidate in the U.S. Senate race in Georgia a couple of years ago instead of Herschel Walker, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=273.62s)]
*  there's a pretty good chance that that person and not Reverend Warnock would be sitting in [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=278.38s)]
*  the United States Senate right now. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=282.06s)]
*  So they want to go back and look at this and say, do we want this? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=283.46s)]
*  Now, the problem is that, again, Cornyn is a bowl of vanilla ice cream, right? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=287.5s)]
*  He's doing nothing for the base. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=290.94s)]
*  The MAGA folks will turn out in March. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=292.74s)]
*  It's going to be a low turnout election. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=295.29999999999995s)]
*  And so now the National Republican Senatorial Committee is going to have to decide how much [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=296.9s)]
*  they're willing to put in to save their own guy. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=301.82000000000005s)]
*  So, you know what it's like to run a campaign, Jim, let's pretend that you are running [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=305.06s)]
*  Cornyn's campaign, which is a bit of a stretch. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=309.18s)]
*  But let's just say that if you see what's unfolding right now, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=311.3s)]
*  do you sit back and just let it play out or do you seize on it in some way? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=317.38000000000005s)]
*  Well, they've got to do something to change the trajectory of this race. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=322.66s)]
*  When you're down 19 points in a low turnout Republican primary, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=325.58000000000004s)]
*  it's time to start moving and time to start trying to make two arguments. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=330.78000000000003s)]
*  The first thing I would do is say he's a better general election candidate, which is [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=334.66s)]
*  exactly what they're doing. And to to read point, I'd go find something to excite the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=337.86s)]
*  base. I'd go start talking to people and saying, this is what I'm for. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=342.78000000000003s)]
*  You know, being a vanilla bowl of ice cream has proven to be a very bad recipe in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=347.26s)]
*  Republican primaries since the Donald Trump era. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=351.3s)]
*  But Jim, do you do an ad say on what just happened? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=353.98s)]
*  I mean, I can come up with a lot of different phrases that you might want to use [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=358.5s)]
*  against a Ken Paxson, given what his wife has said. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=362.7s)]
*  But do you just let it play out and go in the other direction as you're saying? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=366.58s)]
*  Hi, Rose. I guess. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=370.66s)]
*  Yeah. Look, I think you wait to see the impact here. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=372.38s)]
*  You you know, right now, don't throw a drowning man a life preserver. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=375.58s)]
*  So don't try to make this political right now. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=380.38s)]
*  He's already got his own problems when you're fighting with your wife on Twitter [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=382.74s)]
*  about their divorce. Stay out of that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=385.78s)]
*  But, you know, going forward as we get closer to the March primary, Cornyn's got [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=388.7s)]
*  to do it. Cornyn's got to do. And eventually his argument is going to be this guy [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=393.41999999999996s)]
*  can't win and look at all of his baggage. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuSWejyZ6k&t=396.82s)]
