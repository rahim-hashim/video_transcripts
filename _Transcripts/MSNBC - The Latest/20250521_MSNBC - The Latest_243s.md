# 'Make the marketplace stronger' and not rely on American taxpayers: Fmr. Sen. Tester
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ)
*  All right, let's put up on the screen what is in the bill as we currently understand it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  There is three point eight trillion dollars in tax cuts two million [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=3.88s)]
*  to the child or two million lost in the child tax credit a higher cap for a salt deduction [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=8.76s)]
*  Maybe forty thousand dollars four hundred and ninety billion in Medicare cuts [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=16.4s)]
*  tighter Medicaid work requirements coming up sooner as well eight million dollars and eight million people would lose [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=21.96s)]
*  Medicaid coverage. I just realized I read that other one wrong two million people would lose the child tax credit [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=30.12s)]
*  Correcting that and three hundred billion in cuts to to food aid. There's also a question [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=36.24s)]
*  Senator about what this is going to do for farmers and I know you were not bad about that farming community is close to you [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=42.08s)]
*  What is happening to the farming farming community right now? And what would this bill mean for them? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=49.24s)]
*  well, I think for the farming community in a word, it's uncertainty because [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=55.0s)]
*  You know markets are really important to be able to get a fair price for our products that we raise [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=58.84s)]
*  and then we're seeing with this this tariff [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  situation putting on tariffs just kind of across the board that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=70.08s)]
*  You know some of our customers are going other places to buy to buy wheat and soy and corn and and all the things that we [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=74.68s)]
*  Raise in this country and without those markets [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=81.68s)]
*  It's going to drive prices down and then it puts more pressures on the taxpayers and increases in national debt and farmers get more subsidies [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  Instead of getting it from the marketplace. We're getting it from the federal government, which is [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  Disturbing for me and I think for most farmers and so there's some big challenges with that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=95.72s)]
*  It could be easily fixed if they took the time to fix it put a competition title in the farm bill so that we can [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=100.72s)]
*  Hold the big companies accountable [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=107.08s)]
*  You know get a tariff policy that works because the one that's being implemented by the president right now isn't working from my perspective and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=109.56s)]
*  And then you'll get those markets back and you'll end up with a situation [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=117.08s)]
*  We're not so reliant on the American taxpayer in the form of subsidies and more reliant on the marketplace for what we get for our [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  Products we raise I've seen a ton of videos on social media where people who are claiming to be farmers [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=128.56s)]
*  Say that they voted for Donald Trump and their farm is gonna go under this was not what they thought they were getting but I [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  Guess you know, this is what's happening and and they're expressing regret [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=140.76s)]
*  I guess of the voting at their vote for Donald Trump. It's hard to tell whether these people are real it's social media [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  It's very hard to fact-check this stuff. Who knows what's what over there. So you tell me you're in a red state [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=150.0s)]
*  What is the reaction? I? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  Would just tell you that I don't think the full impact the tariffs have happened yet, but I think that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=158.44s)]
*  The administration knows it otherwise they wouldn't be pumping so much money into this proposal that came out of the house [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  that is to go in a reconciliation bill that is basically the farm bill and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  I would tell you that until [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  Farmers start feeling in the wallet and I don't think it's happened yet in a lot of cases [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=179.28s)]
*  Maybe in soybean country it has but I don't think it has in in wheat country where I'm from [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=184.6s)]
*  Until that starts to happen [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=190.32s)]
*  I don't know that folks are gonna change their perspective. Unfortunately, I will say this once it starts happening [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  it's too late and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  And folks the margin in farming for family farmers is not much. It's pretty close and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=200.68s)]
*  You get higher input costs you get lower market costs. You get a lot of family farmers that are gonna go broke [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=208.04s)]
*  So hopefully hopefully the administration can change course on a lot of these markets [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=213.84s)]
*  Like I said before Katie, I just I just don't think farmers want to get the subsidies [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=219.2s)]
*  I think they want to get their paycheck from the marketplace. That's the way it's always been and I think that let's let's make the marketplace stronger [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=223.88s)]
*  Let's not depend upon the American taxpayer. Yeah, they don't want to live off the dole [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=231.24s)]
*  John Tester senator. Thank you so much for joining us and you tell us when things start to change in part in a weak country [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=235.84s)]
*  We'd like to know [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssd_BfiMMDQ&t=242.16s)]
