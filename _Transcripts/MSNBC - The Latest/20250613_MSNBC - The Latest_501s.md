# 'He was manhandled': Democratic strategist reacts to senator's removal from news conference
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc)
*  and in balancing. Sir, sir, hands up, hands up. I'm Senator Alex Padilla. I have a question [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=0.0s)]
*  for the secretary because the fact of the matter is a half a dozen violent criminals [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=7.8s)]
*  that you're rotating on your, on your, hands up. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=13.8s)]
*  On the ground, on the ground, hands behind your back, hands behind your back. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=20.32s)]
*  That was Democratic Senator Alex Padilla of California being forcibly removed, even handcuffed, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=31.32s)]
*  after a news conference in Los Angeles yesterday when he tried to ask a question of Homeland [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=59.28s)]
*  Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a media event related to immigration. It's just one [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=63.88s)]
*  of the key news items this week. The panel is here to break it down. Annalise Keller, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=68.56s)]
*  she's a former communications director for Republican Senator Cory Gardner and also with [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  us Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha. Chuck, I want to start with you, just your immediate [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=76.16s)]
*  reaction to seeing Senator Padilla in that position, in that moment. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=80.68s)]
*  Look, I grew up in East Texas and it's, it's what he was, was manhandled. That's what happens. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  That's what you saw. And it was shocking to a lot of us. You know, Alex is a really good [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  friend of mine. I may or may not have helped him move into his apartment when he got here [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=92.68s)]
*  to DC. I knew when he was secretary of state, we fished together like he's a different, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=96.2s)]
*  we were talking about this. I've been talking about this to my friends is like, he is one [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  of the kindest soft spoken men I have ever known. Correct. You would expect this or something [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=103.16s)]
*  crazy from Chuck Rocha. I'm a little mouthy and sometimes I get a little animated, not [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=107.84s)]
*  Alex Padilla. He's always very measured, always very controlled. There's a few things we should [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=112.12s)]
*  know. He's got an office in that building. He was escorted into the press conference [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=116.04s)]
*  by an FBI agent and another security officer. Folks knew he was there and about the recording [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  piece, it was a press conference. Of course they want to be recording and he had went [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=124.36s)]
*  there. He was there for an earlier meeting just to ask a question. I had a reporter ask [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=128.16s)]
*  me yesterday was, do you think this was set up? I'm like, look, I've worked for politicians [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  for a long time. I have helped them set up something just like this. Alex Padilla, don't [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=135.74s)]
*  set up something like this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=140.08s)]
*  But let's even put aside whether it was set up or not, because I know that the talking [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=141.24s)]
*  point on right wing media is that this was someone who was looking for a political stunt. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=144.72s)]
*  But Capitol Hill is a community, right? These senators, as much as they might spar with [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  each other, they know each other. I think everyone knows who Senator Padilla is. Does [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=154.4s)]
*  this change the contours at all? Or are we just in a place where each side retreats to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=159.08s)]
*  their own little tribes and says that it's okay that a senator was treated this way? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=164.0s)]
*  He announces himself as a senator. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=169.56s)]
*  On one hand, I do think that Senate Republicans have seen this and have come out and said [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=171.52s)]
*  that they are really uncomfortable with this video. But, you know, then you have speaker [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=176.0s)]
*  Mike Johnson, who's throwing around words like censure. So I think maybe in the short [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=180.24s)]
*  term people are really disturbed by this video. But, you know, two things can be true at the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=185.52s)]
*  same time. I don't think it was an appropriate way to handle a senator at all. I think that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=190.8s)]
*  that was reprehensible the way that he was handcuffed. I mean, it's really, really shocking [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=196.44s)]
*  to see that video. But at the same time, I mean, when this when a cabinet secretary is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=200.84s)]
*  providing remarks in a live format and, you know, security guards see someone who they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=205.92s)]
*  feel like is coming forward, rushing in a way where they feel that it's threatening, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=210.76s)]
*  whether or not it's right. You know, I can certainly understand why they feel in that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=214.56s)]
*  moment they need to create a little distance between that between him and Kristi Noem. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=217.4s)]
*  But, you know, watching that play out was really disturbing. Yeah. And I do think, yeah, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=223.72s)]
*  go ahead. You were just going to say he went to a metal detector to get in there. If you're [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=229.64s)]
*  the Secret Service and you're working for a cabinet secretary and you don't know who [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=232.4s)]
*  a U.S. senator is, shame on you. Like we should know these basic things about what's going [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=235.24s)]
*  on. And I don't play ignorant to what they thought or who they thought he was. Yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=239.62s)]
*  And I think it comes amid obviously a very tense situation on the ground in Los Angeles. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=242.84s)]
*  You saw Secretary Noem giving remarks on that topic overnight. We saw a court say that federal [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=247.7s)]
*  troops still get to stay basically under the command of the president who has them there [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=253.04s)]
*  over the wishes of the California governor. You and I were talking about this yesterday [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=257.66s)]
*  through a political lens of is it a winner for Trump to continue keeping the focus on [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=261.28s)]
*  immigration? But how long can he keep that focus there when the military angle of this [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=266.12s)]
*  is increasingly becoming a top headline, as it should be? Yeah, I think something to watch [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=271.5s)]
*  is what's happening across the country. If these continue to spread, if things continue [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=276.16s)]
*  to escalate across the country, I think it will become untenable because, you know, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=281.14000000000004s)]
*  certainly it will be difficult to keep. I mean, that is where everyone will be looking [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=285.3s)]
*  to see what's going to be happening and see how Trump is going to be responding in all [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=290.1s)]
*  of these different states and what these governors are going to be doing. I think it's going [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=293.38s)]
*  to be really difficult to keep up this the activity that he's doing at the federal level. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=296.94s)]
*  Let me say two more things about Alex Padilla. He's not up for reelection. Yeah. Who know [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=302.3s)]
*  politics. Yeah. He is not running for president of the United States. Right. And I probably [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=306.98s)]
*  got 15 texts from people last night raising money off of this, and none of them were Alex [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=310.3s)]
*  Padilla. Like, this is not who he is as a person. There's a lot of folks that do a lot [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=313.98s)]
*  of politics around lots of disturbing things. On both sides. Absolutely. But this ain't [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=317.74s)]
*  one of them from Alex Padilla. Yeah. And so then when you think about the immigration [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=321.38s)]
*  layering that's over this, right, that's the very root of why we're seeing what's happening [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  in Los Angeles happening. This is an issue that the party has struggled with. And so [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=328.48s)]
*  where do you think it goes next as the Trump administration is saying, well, politically, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=334.1s)]
*  for us? Is there a tipping point here somewhere? I think so. And I think Alex put a human [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=338.58000000000004s)]
*  face to it. Alex got emotional when he came out talking about his parents because they're [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=343.5s)]
*  dishwashers and they were made. And now he's a U.S. Senator. He was to remind people that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=346.58000000000004s)]
*  immigrants are good for this country. If you come here and you're a bad actor, even Alex [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=350.5s)]
*  Padilla, who is an immigration champion, says, sure, deport them. But let's look at this [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=354.18s)]
*  from the human side. We can have law and order and a safe immigration system all at the same [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=357.5s)]
*  time. And that's what he's demanding. And that's what Democrats should be talking about. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=362.34000000000003s)]
*  And when you then see that Trump himself even seems to be starting to be made aware of the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=365.66s)]
*  reality on the ground in places like Los Angeles, where immigrants are so embedded in the community. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=369.42s)]
*  I mean, they are such a key part of the infrastructure for basic things like food and farming and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=374.54s)]
*  hospitality. Trump seems to be aware of that. Now, what do you think the reaction, Annalise, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=380.02000000000004s)]
*  is going to be from Republicans on the Hill who have been defending what he's been doing [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=384.94000000000005s)]
*  on immigration? And now they see him saying, all right, well, maybe we actually have to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=388.82000000000005s)]
*  make some allowances. I think it's going to be a mixed bag. I mean, you have a lot of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=392.1s)]
*  Republicans that moderate on the issue of immigration. You have a lot that don't that are [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=395.3s)]
*  going to be frustrated. But to your point, I do think that that is a more difficult place [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=399.46000000000004s)]
*  for Republicans to be, to be talking about the people that are in. They want to be talking [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=404.02000000000004s)]
*  on, they want to be focusing on the criminal element. That's what they want to be talking [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=407.82s)]
*  about. And when you do put a human face to it and when senators can see themselves, I [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=411.38s)]
*  mean, I think it changes the conversation in a way that's certainly not helpful for [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=416.86s)]
*  President Trump. The reason Trump is moving is because the Chamber of Commerce, people [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=420.42s)]
*  who own businesses understand what immigrants mean to our economy. And they're in his ear [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=423.98s)]
*  now going, look, big boy, I understand you need to get out here and look tough and you need [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=428.06s)]
*  to do the whole part about all the bad people who, quote unquote, may be here. But this is [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=431.1s)]
*  how we run our businesses. And when you're chasing farm workers through the fields of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=434.90000000000003s)]
*  central California, it's bad for my great business. That's what he's hearing. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=438.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I do think that there is a bottom line impact here that people have been warning [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=441.38s)]
*  about. And now it may seem that it finally has fallen on Trump's ears. TBD on how Stephen [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=445.34000000000003s)]
*  Miller, the chief architect of his immigration and deportation plan, feels about this. He's [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=450.34s)]
*  been a hardliner for decades now. We're going to have to leave it there with our brilliant [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=455.34s)]
*  panel. But Chuck Rocha and Annalise Keller, I so appreciate you coming on. Bring your [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=459.61999999999995s)]
*  expertise on this Friday morning. A lot of news to cover. But Chuck, you've got a new [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=463.97999999999996s)]
*  show called Rocha Revolution. It's available now on Substack, trying to figure out the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=467.5s)]
*  ways the Democrats are speaking to or not effectively to voters in that space. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=471.85999999999996s)]
*  Super excited. We're super excited about the new show. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=476.97999999999996s)]
*  Thank you, Chuck. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6C6tuYmpnc&t=479.42s)]
