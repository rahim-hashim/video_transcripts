# Supreme Court has to 'stand up' to Trump or else 'democracy is in peril': Journalist
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY)
*  Dave, this is a big escalation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=0.0s)]
*  Explain where this fight stands now and where we think it goes from here. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=2.5s)]
*  Yeah, it is, Chris. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=6.08s)]
*  And this is a very big escalation. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Good afternoon from very crowded briefing room where this press briefing is set to get [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=11.68s)]
*  started in just a few moments. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  As you said, after the administration froze those federal fundings yesterday, this morning [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=17.18s)]
*  President Trump writing on social media an escalation. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=21.7s)]
*  Perhaps Harvard should lose its tax exempt status and be taxed as a political entity. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=25.8s)]
*  This essentially is what the administration has been arguing that Harvard University [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=30.44s)]
*  has been pushing a political ideology. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=35.7s)]
*  But as you mentioned, Chris, Harvard University is not backing down and essentially turning [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=38.84s)]
*  this into a battle over free speech and saying that while some of the administration's demand [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=42.8s)]
*  had to do with combating anti-Semitism and the university's view, most of them were about [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=47.2s)]
*  stifling free speech. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=53.28s)]
*  Now, of course, this battle has huge implications, not just for Harvard University, but really [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=54.76s)]
*  for institutions of higher learning across the country. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=58.68s)]
*  And Chris, it is certainly not the only topic that's going to come up in just a few moments [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=62.12s)]
*  when Press Secretary Caroline Levitt comes into this briefing room. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=65.6s)]
*  Certainly there'll be questions about that controversial deportation of the Maryland [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=69.2s)]
*  man who was sent to El Salvador, as well as ongoing questions about the future of the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=73.52s)]
*  administration's tariff policy, which is, of course, being watched by markets across [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=77.8s)]
*  the world. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=82.06s)]
*  Chris? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=83.06s)]
*  Gabe Gutierrez, thank you so much for that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=84.22s)]
*  We'll keep our eye where you are. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=86.02s)]
*  Meantime, Eddie, I want to know just some of what the White House had demanded from Harvard. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  They want a change in governance, access to hiring and admissions data, an end to all [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=93.26s)]
*  DEI programs, and they want to put multiple departments under external audit. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=98.02000000000001s)]
*  As you well know, other elite universities have faced the same challenge, including where [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=104.34s)]
*  you were, Princeton. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=108.62s)]
*  So I wonder what your reaction is to Harvard's decision to fight back and the significance [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=110.30000000000001s)]
*  of that decision coming from, again, the oldest and richest university in the United States. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=114.82000000000001s)]
*  I think it's extraordinarily important, Chris, for Harvard to do what it's currently doing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=120.98s)]
*  I think it sets the stage for universities and colleges across the country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=125.58000000000001s)]
*  Remember, these institutions are in some ways a jewel in America's crown, some of the best [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=130.1s)]
*  institutions in the world for them to defend their basic and basic values, their basic [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=135.98s)]
*  mission. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=141.42s)]
*  And I think we need to widen the aperture a little bit and ask a different question. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=142.42s)]
*  What is actually behind this assault? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=146.46s)]
*  What's behind the attack on Americans, America's universities and colleges? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  It goes back to, in my mind, Chris, to 1951 with William Buckley's book God and Man at [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=154.3s)]
*  Yale. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=162.66s)]
*  And he worried about collectivism, kanzism, secularism, worried about what liberalism [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=163.9s)]
*  was doing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=169.38s)]
*  And that was before black people and women actually made their way to these institutions. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=170.38s)]
*  I'm not worried about Christopher Ruffo. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=174.22s)]
*  I'm worried about what the Manhattan Institute, what Rehan Salam is trying to do and attack [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  these institutions. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=181.5s)]
*  So as Harvard pushes back, we need to ask some deeper questions about what's motivating [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=182.5s)]
*  this assault on free speech and American higher education. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=189.1s)]
*  Well, Kimberly, we should note this letter from Harvard did not say that it was suing [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=192.54s)]
*  the Trump administration, but it did come from outside legal counsel. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=196.54s)]
*  So I wonder what the feeling is and the people you're talking to say is the belief that this [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  is headed to court, potentially maybe even the Supreme Court? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=205.3s)]
*  I think it is all but certainly headed to the Supreme Court, which will have the opportunity [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=210.22s)]
*  in my opinion, it missed last week in proving to be a guardrail to Donald Trump's autocracy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=217.33999999999997s)]
*  With all respect to my friend, the professor, I'm going to take it back even further to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=224.38s)]
*  the 1930s when Nazis marched across Europe. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=227.66s)]
*  They attacked universities. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=231.94s)]
*  They attacked the rule of law. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=233.22s)]
*  They pretended to have the support of the people all while bending the government to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  its will to usher in authoritarianism and fascism. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=239.7s)]
*  And that's the moment that we're in and the Supreme Court needs to recognize that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=244.46s)]
*  Punishing students based on their speech is unconstitutional, regardless of what nation [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=249.06s)]
*  of which they are a citizen. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=254.62s)]
*  That is just wrong. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=256.58s)]
*  This should be a layup for the Supreme Court. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=257.58s)]
*  But so should have been the deportation of a legal resident with no way to get him back. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=259.3s)]
*  And the Supreme Court let that slide, at least in the preliminary, last week, which means [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=265.82s)]
*  that Kilmar Abrego-Garcia still is in that brutal El Salvadoran prison. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=272.02s)]
*  At some point, the Supreme Court has to stand up, read the Constitution, say enough is enough [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=276.97999999999996s)]
*  and be a check on the president or else democracy is in peril for all of us, including U.S. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=282.82s)]
*  citizens. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=288.06s)]
*  So, Eddie, former President Obama, who I should note, went to two of the universities in question, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=289.06s)]
*  both Columbia and Harvard, tweeted on Monday that he does believe, as you do, that Harvard [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=296.58s)]
*  is setting an example for other colleges and universities. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=302.02s)]
*  He said he hopes they do follow suit. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=304.78s)]
*  Something that we heard from the faculty, we were on campus at Columbia just yesterday, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=307.26s)]
*  and I want to play that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=310.58s)]
*  Stand up for higher education. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=314.02s)]
*  Second, fight back against the federal attacks. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=315.53999999999996s)]
*  We need to ask our leadership, why can't you show the same kind of backbone and principles [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=318.41999999999996s)]
*  as the leadership at Harvard and Princeton? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=322.97999999999996s)]
*  As an educator, what particularly concerns me is this pattern of government overreach [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=325.36s)]
*  that's being tolerated by the powers that be. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  If we lose our academic freedom, we have lost everything. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=332.24s)]
*  On the other hand, Eddie, the last public accounting, I think it was last year, Harvard [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  had a $53.2 billion endowment. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=341.72s)]
*  So I'm not saying $2.2 billion isn't anything, but it is comparative, right? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=345.12s)]
*  And most universities could not take a hit like that. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=352.24s)]
*  They couldn't even come close to it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=354.36s)]
*  So realistically speaking, can other colleges and universities potentially respond the way [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  that Harvard did? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=362.6s)]
*  Not necessarily, depending upon their endowments. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=365.16s)]
*  And we have to understand the hierarchical nature of American higher education. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=368.16s)]
*  There's a reason why the Ivy Leagues are the Ivy Leagues. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=372.24s)]
*  There's a reason why the Little Ivies, the Williams, the Swarthmores, the Amhersts, why [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=374.52000000000004s)]
*  they are secure and other liberal arts colleges are trying to make ends meet. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=379.0s)]
*  So we need to understand the differential nature of financing, right, the financial [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=383.94s)]
*  status of the institutions in American higher ed. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=389.5s)]
*  I want to say that up front. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=392.42s)]
*  But I also want to say that government investment in higher education has a payoff. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=393.94s)]
*  It's a public good. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=400.9s)]
*  Cancer research, health care research, research around AI, all of this funding that comes [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=402.62s)]
*  from the federal government that in some ways spurs our work in the STEM areas and in the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=408.5s)]
*  sciences as it were, has a benefit. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=413.58s)]
*  So what does it mean to cut it off in this way? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=416.38s)]
*  And what will happen? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=419.06s)]
*  How will it impact the country moving forward in terms of, shall we say, some of the brightest [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=420.06s)]
*  minds across the world making their way here and not feeling comfortable doing their work [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=425.82s)]
*  in a place where autocracy seems to reign? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=432.02s)]
*  And I think that's a question we have to ask ourselves, Chris, as we move forward. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=435.29999999999995s)]
*  The other thing, Kimberly, that Eddie said at the start was about the jewel in the crown [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=439.06s)]
*  and why it's so aspirational. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=444.42s)]
*  I remember in my small town in Ohio when somebody got into Harvard, it was like the town made [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=446.1s)]
*  a collective gasp, right? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=451.02s)]
*  That's where these schools stand. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=453.06s)]
*  And a lot of this money, we should say, is covering students who couldn't otherwise afford [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=455.65999999999997s)]
*  to go there, right? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=462.62s)]
*  95% of the students at Harvard are receiving some sort of financial aid. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=464.5s)]
*  A quarter of them come from families that make less than $100,000 a year. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=468.42s)]
*  Would Democrats be smart to frame this about students? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=472.78s)]
*  Would they be smart to frame this about what quality is brought in? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=478.26s)]
*  Because it's a jewel in the crown, foreign students aspire to come here as well, to frame [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=483.72s)]
*  it as a place where research gets done with lifesaving programs. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=488.42s)]
*  How do you fight against this if you are not Harvard, the Harvard president or the Harvard [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=494.7s)]
*  board? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=499.74s)]
*  I think absolutely, Chris, that is exactly what Democrats should be saying about this, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=500.74s)]
*  that this is a brain drain, that this is a gift to our adversaries around the world in [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=508.1s)]
*  terms of our readiness to compete in an economy with the smartest people and the best technology [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=514.38s)]
*  and the most cutting edge research. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=521.02s)]
*  But I think Democrats should also not shy away from the authoritarianism that is at [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=523.62s)]
*  play here. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=530.3399999999999s)]
*  The reason that the elite institutions are being attacked and not get some of the other [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=531.78s)]
*  ones is because that is what happens. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=536.6999999999999s)]
*  That is what Trump believes that the elites are somehow poisoning our nation and by teaching [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=539.22s)]
*  the truth, by talking about what the Constitution actually says. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=547.5400000000001s)]
*  So they are the target. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=552.34s)]
*  And unfortunately, some, like my graduate alma mater, Columbia, folded, much to my dismay. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=554.22s)]
*  But I think as Harvard and MIT and Princeton and others stand up, it will make it easier [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=560.12s)]
*  for Democrats to help defend this, although Democrats shouldn't have needed a reason. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=565.24s)]
*  They should have been out in front on this from the beginning. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=569.74s)]
*  And some have, but it needs to be a part of that organized message against what's happening. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=571.62s)]
*  Doug, as I'm listening, the word elites has become a four-letter word. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=576.86s)]
*  The right has become pretty successful, right, at making that seem like it's something terrible. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=581.86s)]
*  And so I wonder what the goal is here. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=588.4200000000001s)]
*  Is it just political red meat for the base? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=590.54s)]
*  Or do you think that that would be not very wise, that in fact what this administration [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=593.26s)]
*  wants to do is to fundamentally reshape the relationship between government and universities [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=600.02s)]
*  writ large? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=605.26s)]
*  Well, I think it goes beyond the base. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=606.26s)]
*  And to get to Eddie's first question about what's causing this, you know, I've been stunned [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=609.06s)]
*  at what I've heard just over the past three months and even two or three years of people [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=613.42s)]
*  who are not Donald Trump fans, people who didn't vote for him, might have written in [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=617.66s)]
*  another Republican candidate in primaries or in the general election who have said, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=621.18s)]
*  I'm sick and tired of what I'm seeing happen on college campuses. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=625.5s)]
*  This happened before the attacks in Israel. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=628.9399999999999s)]
*  But certainly, as we saw, you know, Palestinian flags being hoisted on college campus after [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=631.18s)]
*  college campus, there's been a very real backlash. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=635.74s)]
*  This is part of it. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=638.6999999999999s)]
*  I have concerns about how far the president is going on this and concerns about what research [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=639.5799999999999s)]
*  funding is. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=645.02s)]
*  And I was, Chris, just last week, I was at my alma mater, the University of North Carolina [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=645.42s)]
*  at Chapel Hill. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=649.74s)]
*  I'm on the Board of Visitors there. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=650.46s)]
*  And what I saw from my school's leadership was here's how we're following the law. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=652.14s)]
*  Here's how we're able to document every bit of spending that we're doing on FNA money, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=656.54s)]
*  which is so critical in how you're dealing with the federal government. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=661.34s)]
*  I'd tell universities, you've got your back against the wall and you're a target. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=665.1s)]
*  This is time to also think about not just speaking truth to power and all that stuff [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=668.78s)]
*  that makes audiences on MSNBC happy, but how can we do a smarter job given the environment [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=672.7s)]
*  that we're in? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=677.98s)]
*  And I haven't heard a whole lot of that outside of UNC at this point. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=678.78s)]
*  And I've spent a lot of time on college campuses, including the Harvard IOP. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poD9-Dj_UYY&t=682.94s)]
