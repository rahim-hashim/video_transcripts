*  the exchanges say the leader of the US Central Command shared detailed [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  information about imminent strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen with [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=17.32s)]
*  Hegseth. Now he did so through a secure government system but within moments [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=21.44s)]
*  Hegseth then shared some of that information in two group chats using the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=26.88s)]
*  Signal app on his personal phone. The Trump administration denies any classified [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=31.56s)]
*  information was shared by Hegseth. This morning Hegseth defended his use of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=36.04s)]
*  Signal on Fox. What was shared over Signal then and now however you [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  characterize it was informal unclassified coordinations for media [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=47.4s)]
*  coordination other things that's what I've said from the beginning. Joining us [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=52.88s)]
*  now from NBC's is joining us now is NBC's Courtney Kube one of the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=57.6s)]
*  reporters behind this exclusive reporting also with us is retired four [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  star General Barry McCaffrey an NBC News military analyst. So Courtney what more [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=65.2s)]
*  have you learned and then there was like one communication between that the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=69.28s)]
*  general and Hegseth that was utilized you know authorized messaging but [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=75.4s)]
*  but then that was secondarily used by Hegseth? Yeah so this has been one of the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=82.64s)]
*  biggest issues throughout this entire discussion about Secretary Hegseth and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=89.08s)]
*  other senior administration officials communicating via Signal since the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=93.44s)]
*  Atlantic published that blockbuster story several weeks ago. The big question [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  here has been was the information that Secretary Hegseth put on that Signal [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=101.56s)]
*  chat that the Atlantic published was that classified? Secretary Hegseth, many [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=106.44s)]
*  administration officials those around the secretary have insisted it was not [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  classified but what we have learned here now Jose is that the information some of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=114.16s)]
*  it word-for-word came directly from the commander of US Central Command General [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=118.04s)]
*  Eric Carrillo. He sent that information and then only moments later minutes later [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=122.72s)]
*  the secretary copied some of that information word-for-word on his [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=127.68s)]
*  personal phone on the Signal messaging app and sent it to that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=132.12s)]
*  Signal chat that the National Security Advisor Mike Waltz set up. Of course now [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=137.2s)]
*  we know that he inadvertently also added a journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=141.72s)]
*  chat but what we're also learning now Jose is that in fact a chat that the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  secretary himself set up on Signal he also included some of that information [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  on that messaging app on the Signal app. What's really critical here is the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  information came from a classified server a classified system and then was [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=158.76s)]
*  transferred to an unclassified system this Signal app and what is also critical [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  here Jose is that the secretary when he set that chat up he included his wife [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=168.16s)]
*  his brother his personal attorney and other officials who are close to him here [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  at the Pentagon some of those officials have now actually even been fired amidst [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=178.04s)]
*  a leak investigation. So this answers one of the big questions the information [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=182.28s)]
*  did come from a classified server and of course it comes at a time when these [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  officials who are very close to Secretary Hegseth have been fired amidst [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=189.92s)]
*  this leak investigation but they're we're hearing from them slowly they put [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  out a statement over the weekend one of them Dan Caldwell he was a senior [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=198.72s)]
*  advisor to the secretary and a close friend up until the time he was fired [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=202.27999999999997s)]
*  late last week went on Tucker Carlson's podcast yesterday and said he still [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=205.72s)]
*  hasn't been told exactly what why he was fired so a lot of questions here still [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=210.56s)]
*  at the Pentagon and I have to say Jose I have never seen a level of chaos in the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=215.11999999999998s)]
*  front office up at the high ranks the highest levels of the Pentagon like this [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=219.28s)]
*  in the 20 years I've covered the building Jose. How would you describe [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=223.44s)]
*  that chaos in what way is that represented? People who are close to in [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=227.56s)]
*  in the closest the inner circle of Secretary Hegseth being walked out [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=233.0s)]
*  escorted out of the building last night or last week without any real [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  information about what they are accused of now going public a senior Pentagon [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=241.72s)]
*  spokesperson writing an op-ed over the weekend releasing it in Politico [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=246.92s)]
*  essentially calling for the president to to to fire or call for Hegseth to resign [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  this level I mean we're only weeks into Secretary Hegseth being the top of the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=256.47999999999996s)]
*  Pentagon and I have never seen such a level of chaos at the closest circles [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=260.76s)]
*  people really directly around him in anything like this ever Jose. Courtney [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=264.47999999999996s)]
*  QB at the Pentagon thank you so very much really appreciate it so general [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=270.52s)]
*  let's get your reaction first to this new reporting that Courtney is bringing [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=273.84s)]
*  us. Well Courtney certainly gave an objective and complete wrap-up to what [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  we're watching happen this is not just about a major security error on the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  part of Secretary Hegseth transferring from a classified communication system [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  to his personal cell phone you know hackers can get on your personal cell [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=301.28s)]
*  phone they can get on to intermediate servers they probably can break signal [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=306.0s)]
*  itself he knew full well what he was doing he was warned to not do it he was [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=312.44s)]
*  putting operational details it would place at risk US Navy carrier pilots it's [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=318.35999999999996s)]
*  really outrageous but I think backing off that we're this sector of defense is [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=325.2s)]
*  acting like Rambo Major you know he's not serious in his purpose he's got [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=331.52s)]

*  as if this is an amateur juvenile look at the cool secrets I have got sort of a [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uhE_8h8FKc&t=350.12s)]
