Video Description: New Jersey Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officials while protesting outside an ICE detention facility alongside three Democratic members of the House, including Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman. “There was no reason for locking up the mayor,” Representative Watson Coleman says. With the Trump administration cracking down on opposition, Representative Watson Coleman says that “we understand why people are so afraid to just walk the streets, to go to work, to drop their kids off to school.”

# ‘We understand why people are so afraid:’ NJ Rep. Watson Coleman on arrest of Newark Mayor Baraka
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo)
*  As we mentioned, today is the 111th day of Donald Trump's second administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=0.0s)]
*  On the 110th day, amid a draconian immigration crackdown and a brutal deportation program, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  the mayor of a major American city was arrested by federal officers outside a newly converted [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=10.08s)]
*  immigration detention center in his very own city. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=15.0s)]
*  Newark, New Jersey mayor Ross Baraka said he had joined congressional leaders in an [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=18.52s)]
*  oversight visit to protect the facility and to inspect its conditions. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=22.8s)]
*  Originally a halfway house, the building was converted into a detention center earlier [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=27.36s)]
*  this year as part of a contract between ICE and the private prison contractor, GEO Group, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=31.48s)]
*  which we talked about a few weeks ago. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=36.68s)]
*  Mayor Baraka, who is also currently running in the Democratic primary for governor of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=38.76s)]
*  New Jersey, had sued to block the deal and says its operation is in violation of city [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=42.96s)]
*  laws and that the facility is not up to code. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=48.72s)]
*  The mayor was apparently arrested after attempting to join representatives Rob Menendez, LaMonica [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  McIver and Bonnie Watson Coleman, who were on site negotiating a tour to inspect the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=57.8s)]
*  facility. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  Alina Habba, the interim U.S. attorney for the district of New Jersey, said in a post [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  on X that Baraka ignored warnings from officials to leave. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=67.5s)]
*  Mayor Baraka was booked on trespassing charges and released from custody a few hours later. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=72.56s)]
*  After his release, he told MSNBC's Jen Psaki on the briefing what had happened. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, I will confer with my lawyers to figure out what's the best pathway forward [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=83.36s)]
*  on this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=87.92s)]
*  I think they completely violated my rights. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=88.92s)]
*  I'm the mayor of the city. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=90.96s)]
*  I have the right to go anywhere in this city, particularly in places where I think our laws [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=91.96s)]
*  are being violated. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=97.72s)]
*  In a statement, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin wrote, members [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=98.72s)]
*  of Congress storming into a detention facility goes beyond a bizarre political stunt and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=104.08s)]
*  law enforcement agents and detainees at risk. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=110.86s)]
*  Members of Congress are not above the law and cannot illegally break into detention [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=113.86s)]
*  facilities. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=119.02s)]
*  Just keep that language in mind for a second, storming and breaking into. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=120.02s)]
*  I'm going to address that in just a moment. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=123.74s)]
*  Notably, the DHS statement doesn't even say anything about Ross Baraka or his arrest or [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=125.86s)]
*  that he says he and members of Congress were standing outside the facility's gates at the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=132.14s)]
*  time of his arrest. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=136.78s)]
*  This incident, like the arrest of a Wisconsin judge last month, is not about one person's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=138.44s)]
*  arrest. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=142.6s)]
*  It's about what's happening to people who are seen as standing in the way of Donald [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=143.6s)]
*  Trump's deportation program. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=146.96s)]
*  It's a flashing red light of what could lie ahead. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  Joining me now to give us more clarity on what happened is the Democratic Congresswoman [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=152.36s)]
*  Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=156.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, great to see you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=158.32s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=159.52s)]
*  I thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to have this discussion. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=161.8s)]
*  It's so vitally important that the people in this country know what's really happening [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=165.88s)]
*  and know it from people who are actually being affected by it and see it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=171.24s)]
*  You were there, so let's talk about this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=177.12s)]
*  The Homeland Security Assistant Secretary, Trisha McLaughlin, characterized the actions [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=178.64s)]
*  by you and your colleagues yesterday as, quote, storming the facility and breaking into. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=183.0s)]
*  Storming and breaking into. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, look, the average person listening to this would probably say you don't have greater [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=192.12s)]
*  rights than I do to storm or break into anything. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=196.12s)]
*  So tell me your response to what she said. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=198.44000000000003s)]
*  We arrived at the facility, the three of us, the three members of Congress, around one [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  o'clock, introduced ourselves to the person who was at the gate, told him why we were [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=206.24s)]
*  there, told him under the law we had the right to conduct an oversight visit, and that's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  what we were doing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=218.44s)]
*  He talked back and forth to people. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=220.44s)]
*  No one said anything to us. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=222.08s)]
*  They wouldn't give us any information. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=223.6s)]
*  Finally, after pressuring him, they brought some other officials out. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=225.36s)]
*  We told them who we were and why we were there and that we had the right to be there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=230.32s)]
*  They opened a gate to let a car out, so we walked into the gate, inside the gate, and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=235.32s)]
*  again identified who we were and why we were there, and they said we're trespassing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=241.88s)]
*  And I said absolutely not. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=246.8s)]
*  There are federal elected officials that have the legal authority to conduct an on-site [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=248.52s)]
*  oversight and tour, and that's what we're here for. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=254.52s)]
*  So after a while, some more ICE officials came around. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=260.2s)]
*  We went up into a facility, which is like a holding area, and spent time with the individual [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  who operates as a warden, although he's called something else, who was very nice to us. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=273.96s)]
*  We kept explaining to him why we were there. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=279.0s)]
*  We asked him to call whatever officials he needed to call to get us access to do the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=281.4s)]
*  tour. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=287.08s)]
*  So various people came down, said they didn't have any authority. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=289.24s)]
*  They're talking to the next person at the next level and on and on and on. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=293.92s)]
*  We were there about almost two hours under those circumstances. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=297.76s)]
*  Then all of a sudden, these other leaders from ICE, who we understand are the highest [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=302.68s)]
*  officials in ICE in New Jersey, they came. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=309.16s)]
*  They came to the room where we were being held, spoke, and then immediately went back [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=314.0s)]
*  outside. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=321.0s)]
*  And so my colleagues and I were wondering what's going on out there. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=322.12s)]
*  We go out there and we find that the mayor is talking to some of the officials inside [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=326.88s)]
*  the gate. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=334.48s)]
*  And so by the time we reached the mayor, the ICE official says to him, you're trespassing. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=336.12s)]
*  You have to leave this area. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  He politely moved out of the area, went behind the gate, stood out there where the protesters [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  were, which is not their property, not this organization's property. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=356.68s)]
*  And I was talking to him for a minute about mayor, you know, we'll use our eyes and our [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  ears to hear what you need to hear about this facility. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  As we were walking back up to the holding area, thinking that we're going to begin our [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=372.68s)]
*  tour, ICE officials started huddling and talking to other people on the phone. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=380.16s)]
*  And so we kind of stopped to see what's going on here because we thought everyone that needed [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=386.48s)]
*  to be there to let us conduct our tour were with us. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=391.12s)]
*  So we overheard the ICE officials say, okay, we're going to arrest him, to which we said, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=397.48s)]
*  arrest him for what? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=405.36s)]
*  He's out there with the protesters. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=407.08s)]
*  But they ignored us. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  They wouldn't answer any of our questions. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  So when they opened the gate to go with their 20-some weaponed officials out there, the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=414.08s)]
*  three of us, the three members of Congress, went out there to shield the mayor. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=422.91999999999996s)]
*  And then it was just chaos. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=428.88s)]
*  And it was very disturbing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=430.96s)]
*  There was no reason for doing this. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  There was no reason for locking up the mayor. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=436.56s)]
*  The mayor was not trespassing. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=438.88s)]
*  I don't see how this is even a legal arrest. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  And now they are trying to say that there were other things going on, which are not true. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=443.92s)]
*  But, you know, I'm so used to this administration at the highest level with the president lying [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=449.88s)]
*  every time he opens his mouth. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=455.4s)]
*  I think he's given those people that work for him the OK to open their mouths and lie [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=457.2s)]
*  because I know two things. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=464.12s)]
*  Number one is that ICE officials were there on the ground with us. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=465.92s)]
*  We subsequently did do our tour. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=469.8s)]
*  And number two, they were talking to people at a higher level than they were. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  So I don't know if that's the Department of Justice, Homeland Security, the U.S. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=478.76000000000005s)]
*  attorney. I don't know who it was, but they were getting instructions to make something [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=483.0s)]
*  out of this that need not happen. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=488.08000000000004s)]
*  Right. That's my question, because we were looking at the video. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=490.6s)]
*  You said you huddled around Mayor Barack. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=492.76000000000005s)]
*  You're a powerful woman, but you're not the biggest person I've ever met. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=495.44s)]
*  You're you're surrounded by a bunch of biggish people who were who had weapons. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=499.72s)]
*  Did you witness anybody on your side assaulting a law enforcement officer or an ICE officer? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely not. The members of Congress and our staff were concerned about the mayor and [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=514.52s)]
*  our staff was concerned about us. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=520.4s)]
*  And the protesters were being peaceful. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=522.72s)]
*  They were filming this. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=525.84s)]
*  There's got to be a gazillion films all over this all over this country now. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=527.5200000000001s)]
*  We weren't trying to start anything. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=532.84s)]
*  We weren't trying to do anything. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=534.76s)]
*  We were trying to protect the mayor from what we thought was an unlawful arrest and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=536.48s)]
*  disrespect of him as the mayor of the largest city in the state of New Jersey. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=540.6800000000001s)]
*  And we were trying to get ICE to recognize that what they were doing was wrong. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=546.08s)]
*  At first, some of them were treating us as if they didn't know who we were. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=551.36s)]
*  And we kept saying, we're members of Congress. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=555.08s)]
*  We've been here for almost two hours. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=557.08s)]
*  You know who we are. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=558.84s)]
*  But there was just like consistently and across the board, especially with the folks in [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  uniform, no respect for who we were and no respect for the mayor, which concerns us [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  tremendously because if you don't respect your legally responsible officials, those [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=573.56s)]
*  who've taken an oath, just like you should have, if you don't respect the mayor and the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=582.52s)]
*  federal officials, then we understand why people are so afraid to just walk the streets, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=590.4799999999999s)]
*  go to work, to drop their kids off to school. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=597.64s)]
*  Because people don't think they've got those same sorts of protection. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=601.96s)]
*  So if you can go for the mayor, everybody's fair game. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=604.96s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for being with us this morning. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=609.52s)]
*  And thank you for taking an intimidator. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  It is helpful to have somebody who is right there tell us what the story is so that we [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=613.52s)]
*  can get great clarity on it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=618.36s)]
*  Democratic Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_e7dsJNTxo&t=619.44s)]
