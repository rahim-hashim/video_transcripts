# ‘Random rants about trophy wives?’: Former George Bush aide slams Trump West Point remarks
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg)
*  On this Memorial Day weekend, President Trump addressed the graduating cadets at West Point and their families [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=0.0s)]
*  while wearing a red Make America Great Again hat. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=6.46s)]
*  It comes as he's imposed his own political agenda on the military, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=10.24s)]
*  and yesterday's remarks were no different as he gave a campaign-style speech [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=14.0s)]
*  touting his crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the military. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=18.66s)]
*  We've liberated our troops from divisive and demeaning political trainings. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=23.16s)]
*  There will be no more critical race theory or transgender for everybody forced onto our brave men and women in uniform [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  or on anybody else for that matter in this country. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=36.96s)]
*  This comes in the wake of Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordering major changes at military academies, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=40.16s)]
*  targeting diversity programs, and ordering academies to eliminate quote divisive concepts. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=47.76s)]
*  But his immigration agenda was also front and center in yesterday's speech [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=54.16s)]
*  as he referenced sending the Army to the southern border and his plans for mass deportations. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=58.06s)]
*  It's not easy. It's not easy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=64.46000000000001s)]
*  But hopefully the courts will allow us to continue. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=69.16s)]
*  You know, we had the greatest election victory. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=73.26s)]
*  We had a great mandate and it gives us the right to do what we want to do to make our country great again. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=76.16s)]
*  And that's what we're going to do. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  Aside from his ramblings about everything from golf to Al Capone, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  Trump also griped about how the United States doesn't hold celebrations of military victories, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=90.25999999999999s)]
*  but he'll get his parade this year. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=96.16s)]
*  That's because on June 14th, the Army will hold a parade to recognize its 250th birthday, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=98.66s)]
*  which also happens to be President Trump's 79th birthday. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=105.86s)]
*  The first tanks bound for the parade began their journey this week from Texas to the nation's capital. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=111.56s)]
*  And the price tag for Trump's military parade? Just a mere 45 million bucks. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=118.96s)]
*  Joining us now, former aid to speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=125.66s)]
*  and current MSNBC political analyst Brendan Buck [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=129.56s)]
*  and former Pennsylvania Congressman Connor Lamb. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=132.66s)]
*  Congressman, Brendan, welcome to the weekend. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=136.76s)]
*  So Congressman Lamb, you're the former member of Congress here. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=140.26s)]
*  So what your thoughts on the president of the United States holding a military parade and spending 45 million bucks to do it? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's one of those things if it wasn't all about him, it might be positive. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=155.16s)]
*  You know, it might help drive recruitment and celebrate the service that these people perform. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=159.96s)]
*  But between his speech yesterday and the parade being on his birthday and the way his whole administration is behaving, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=164.26000000000002s)]
*  he's dividing the pool of people that want to serve in the military into his loyalists and everybody else, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=171.66s)]
*  which ultimately undermines the military and makes us a bad move. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=177.06s)]
*  Brendan, one of the things that Republicans used to talk about is the fact that they want to keep politics out of the military. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=182.46s)]
*  The speech as Jonathan just laid out very clearly had that in spades over and over and over again. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=189.76s)]
*  We shouldn't be surprised or shocked because it's Donald Trump. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=194.56s)]
*  But are Republicans just their hands up? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=197.45999999999998s)]
*  They don't care even the ones that really care about keeping politics out of the military. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=200.66s)]
*  So, I mean, I don't know if it's Republican or Democrat. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=204.06s)]
*  I will say I've actually always had an issue with presidents going and giving speeches in front of military audiences, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=206.26s)]
*  even though they're commander in chief. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=212.06s)]
*  Now, if they're going in the role of commander in chief and they have some specific reason to be there in that position, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=213.16s)]
*  I think I can understand that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=219.96s)]
*  But Donald Trump is certainly not the first president who has gone and given a speech that veered into the political in front of the military. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=221.66s)]
*  And I've always been uneasy about that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=227.76s)]
*  Now, this is taking it to a whole other level. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=229.46s)]
*  He's got the hat. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=231.26s)]
*  I don't know if he was worried about his hair or something. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=232.36s)]
*  But like it was clearly not just there in his role as commander in chief. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=234.46s)]
*  And there was some, I guess, some elements of it that were a normal commencement speech. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=237.76s)]
*  But it is politicizing the military in a way that I'm just very uncomfortable with in general. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=241.86s)]
*  Presidents have done it a lot. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  And now we're just getting further and further down this road. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=246.66000000000003s)]
*  I don't think that's what the service academies are for, to have politics injected into what they're doing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=249.06s)]
*  They have one mission, service of this country, and it should have nothing to do with everything else that's going on in Washington. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=253.46s)]
*  So I find it very uncomfortable and I sort of always have. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=258.76s)]
*  Well, just for context, every year the president rotates between the four service academies. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=261.56s)]
*  And it was when I was working for President Bush, when he was going to West Point. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=266.76s)]
*  I remember working on the dress for that and it wasn't looking at anything remotely campaign related. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=270.46s)]
*  What they had, what they had me do was find heroism stories of West Point graduates in our recent wars. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=277.76s)]
*  And so that was an emphasis about their service, about, you know, the history, the storied history. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  It wasn't about this just celebration of himself and then random rants about trophy wives. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=290.56s)]
*  But that just, you know, like it was really, you kind of just wonder. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  But Congressman, former Congressman, are you there, Connor? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  Is he there? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=308.36s)]
*  He's not there. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=309.36s)]
*  So does this climate make you think I want to get back to Washington right now? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=310.16s)]
*  Well, you know, who it has me thinking about is the service members themselves. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=318.56s)]
*  You know, I was in basic officer training for the Marine Corps in 2009 when Obama went to West Point. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=321.96s)]
*  And they actually broke our training, assembled us all in the squad bay and set up a little TV for us to watch his address [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=327.56s)]
*  because he was explaining why he wanted to send more troops to Afghanistan and what it was about. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=334.06s)]
*  And my recollection of that is that there were probably 50 people in the room with me [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  and I bet there were not 10 Obama voters in that room. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=344.35999999999996s)]
*  But there wasn't a single person who doubted the mission. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=347.85999999999996s)]
*  And that was like a really hard time in our lives. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=350.96s)]
*  We're barely sleeping, barely eating, being pushed to the max. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=352.96s)]
*  And that speech gave us a sense of purpose of what we were doing there and why we were making those sacrifices. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=356.26s)]
*  And I think with Trump, when you have him making everything partisan and everything aligned between him and everyone else, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=361.46s)]
*  you're never going to get that same feeling of motivation in the service members and the desire to make all these sacrifices [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=367.85999999999996s)]
*  because it's about the country. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=373.96s)]
*  You'll get the people who like him that want to do that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  But everybody else in the country is going to be left wondering like, do I even join the military after this? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=377.76s)]
*  And that's what we're losing when you have days like yesterday. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=381.96s)]
*  You know, Elise brought up, you know, trophy wives. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=385.26s)]
*  Let's just let's just play it because it was one of many rambles in the president's speech. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=388.86s)]
*  Alphonse Capone was a monster. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=398.06s)]
*  He was a very hardened criminal. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=400.36s)]
*  I went through more investigations than Alphonse Capone. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=402.86s)]
*  And now I'm talking to you as president. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=406.66s)]
*  Can you believe this? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=408.66s)]
*  I must tell you, a lot of trophy wives. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  Does it work out? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=412.06s)]
*  They subjected the armed forces to all manner of social projects and political causes while leaving our borders undefended [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=413.06s)]
*  and depleting our arsenals to fight other countries wars. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=421.76000000000005s)]
*  The job of the US Armed Forces is not to host drag shows. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  We will not have men playing in women's sports, if that's OK. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=431.36s)]
*  And so, Congressman, as a member of the military, a veteran, if you had been sitting out there and for that speech yesterday, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=438.46000000000004s)]
*  how would you feel? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=449.56s)]
*  What would you be thinking? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=450.66s)]
*  I mean, I probably would have laughed at the absurdity that I'm supposed to follow this person. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=453.66s)]
*  Like that's what you, in the military, you really want to admire your leaders because you're making true sacrifices for them [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=459.16s)]
*  and putting a lot on the line. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=465.56s)]
*  And the idea that this guy is who's going to lead these amazing young Americans is just a joke. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=466.76000000000005s)]
*  And I feel bad for their families who were in the audience and probably sacrificed a lot to get them there. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=472.56s)]
*  Brendan, we have the NSC dismissing some staffers. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=479.96000000000004s)]
*  Sources believe at least half of workers are being affected. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=483.06s)]
*  So it's not just the kind of rambling speech we saw with Donald Trump. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=487.26s)]
*  There's also the different way that they approach national security. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=490.26s)]
*  The military, we've seen what Hegseth has done at the Department of Defense or sometimes hasn't done. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=493.56s)]
*  I'm curious, as someone who I assume cares about the national security of the country, what is when you hear something like that, right? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=498.26s)]
*  That half of those folks are either going back to the departments in which they were at originally or are being dismissed. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=505.06s)]
*  What does that say about how this administration views the national security apparatus? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=512.36s)]
*  Well, it's hard not to look at all this through the filter of how Laura Lumer came in and sort of rooted out leaders within the National Security Council. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=516.66s)]
*  When your national security apparatus has to run through a filter of sort of the MAGA world rather than first and foremost, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=525.16s)]
*  can you keep America safe? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=531.66s)]
*  That's a real, real problem. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=533.3599999999999s)]
*  And I mean, the speech is sort of more to it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=534.76s)]
*  I mean, everything sort of is part of this political apparatus and nothing exists in the lane that it should and nothing is really sacred anymore. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=537.06s)]
*  The military is not sacred. The courts are not sacred. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=544.96s)]
*  And the sort of separation of powers. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=546.76s)]
*  Everything is just part of the Trump show. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=548.36s)]
*  And it kind of it takes away, I think, from a lot of the principles that make our country special. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=550.36s)]
*  And what has worked for us for so long is we take these things very seriously. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=554.46s)]
*  We don't allow politics to seep into all of it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=557.96s)]
*  And whether it's the National Security Council or anything else, politics need to be driving everything. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=560.26s)]
*  And that's very concerning. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=564.36s)]
*  What's just been a sea change since 2015 when Donald Trump hit the scene in terms of Republicans and foreign policy, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=565.36s)]
*  going from a very interventionist foreign policy to now a more restrained. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=573.36s)]
*  J.D. Vance calls it strategic realism. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=579.36s)]
*  Do you think that Trump's grip on changing the foreign policy of the GOP is complete or do you still think it's more of a they're following him? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=581.66s)]
*  But deep down, they still want to have a more robust military presence. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=590.86s)]
*  No, I think there's a lot of tension there. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=595.66s)]
*  And I think most Republicans still believe in a really strong military. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=597.36s)]
*  Secretly. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=600.76s)]
*  Even Donald Trump thinks we should have a strong military. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=601.46s)]
*  He wants to have a big parade showing off all of our tanks. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=603.76s)]
*  He just has that sort of isolationist view. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=606.0600000000001s)]
*  I think it's going to ultimately play out. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=608.76s)]
*  The result is going to be how it plays out. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=611.46s)]
*  You know, what we're doing around the world, trying to retreating, I don't think is going to work. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=613.96s)]
*  And I think that's going to have a lasting impact on how people see Trumpism. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=618.0600000000001s)]
*  Same thing with a lot of his tariff policy. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  When you put it in practice and Trump gets what he says he's always wanted and we see that it doesn't work very well, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=622.6600000000001s)]
*  I think people will be able to the traditional conservatives who believe in strong national security will use that to their advantage. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=628.16s)]
*  So I don't think this is one place where I don't think the sort of war within the party has been lost. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=634.76s)]
*  I think you have a lot of very strong national concern because national security conservatives who still want to have their say. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=638.76s)]
*  You know, wait, how much time do we have left? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=645.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because we could keep going on that one for a while. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=647.8599999999999s)]
*  Because I would. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=650.26s)]
*  Okay, good, because Congressman, I think you just mentioned J.D. Vance, the vice president. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=651.66s)]
*  You mentioned J.D. Vance, the vice president. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=658.66s)]
*  You know, he says I'm going to put up this headline from the Associated Press. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=660.66s)]
*  Vance says Trump will use U.S. military decisively rather than in open ended conflicts of the past, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=665.16s)]
*  of the past that his Naval Academy graduation speech. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=671.86s)]
*  Open ended conflicts, I guess that's a reference to what they were calling forever wars. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=677.46s)]
*  But to Elisa's, I think it was Elisa's point about the change in the Republican Party from interventionist to this point, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=684.0600000000001s)]
*  what's worse than isolationism? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=692.26s)]
*  Like you can't, I mean, your view of this new, it seems to be the new Trump Vance doctrine of American military might. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=695.26s)]
*  Well, I think you have to look at it in the context of everything that Trump does, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=705.06s)]
*  which is usually about settling his own scores and sort of carrying out his own political hatchet job. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=709.26s)]
*  So if it were truly a doctrine of we're going to use military force decisively, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=716.66s)]
*  but in a limited way, and that's going to apply across the board and we're going to we're going to make those decisions based on like the merits of every case. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=722.9599999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of Americans would feel pretty good about that. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=730.76s)]
*  But what we usually see from Trump is like with his terror policy, for example, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=732.96s)]
*  he targets people that make him mad or that he thinks are not serving him particularly. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=737.86s)]
*  So what this policy is probably really going to be is the use of military force in situations [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=742.46s)]
*  where Donald Trump himself personally gets annoyed with whoever the target is or wants to demonstrate some sign of strength [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=747.96s)]
*  because he's struggling politically somewhere else. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=754.1600000000001s)]
*  You [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lpc7hmp2Cg&t=762.96s)]
