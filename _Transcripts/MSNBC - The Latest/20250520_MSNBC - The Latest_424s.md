# Beat the pavement, fight against the chaos: Keisha Lance Bottoms’ plan to win GA governor’s mansion
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4)
*  The last time Georgia elected a Democrat for governor was 1998. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=0.0s)]
*  Next year, the party hopes to change their luck. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=5.28s)]
*  And today, former Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=8.4s)]
*  jumped into the race to replace the outgoing term-limited Republican Brian Kemp. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=12.96s)]
*  Her focus? Help small businesses hurt by Donald Trump's tariffs, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=17.76s)]
*  expand health care while Republicans in Washington eye Medicaid cuts, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=21.72s)]
*  and make it more affordable to buy a house and pay rent. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=26.4s)]
*  And joining us now for her first national TV interview since announcing her candidacy, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=30.4s)]
*  Keisha Lance Bottoms. Congratulations and welcome. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=36.24s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me. And congratulations to all as well. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=41.04s)]
*  Thank you. Sorry, there's a slight delay. Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=46.24s)]
*  Mayor, let's get into it. You know, you are making small businesses a key part of your platform. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=49.84s)]
*  There's NBC News reporting that was published on April 20th that talks about [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=55.68s)]
*  Atlanta, saying Atlanta boasted the second most new business applications behind only Las Vegas, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=59.76s)]
*  but the Trump administration's trade policies are making it harder to recruit companies to the area. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=65.68s)]
*  And this was Jerry Parrish, who was the chief economist at the Metro Atlanta chamber. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=70.8s)]
*  How are you going to deliver for small businesses if folks send you to the governor's mansion? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=75.84s)]
*  Well, Simone, in Georgia, about 45% of the employees in the state are employed by small [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  businesses in our state. And in the same way as Mayor of Atlanta, I was able to lean in, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=88.96s)]
*  and we had to lean in during COVID to fill in the gaps, because what we know, there was no [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=93.52s)]
*  leadership coming from the White House under Donald Trump. So it meant providing support services [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  for our small businesses, making sure they had access to grants and that they could access [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=105.36s)]
*  low percentage loans, that they could have someone that they could go to in our investment Atlanta [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=112.08s)]
*  arm to get the support that they needed to help scale their businesses, to help expand their [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=118.56s)]
*  businesses, and to help survive during what was an uncertain time. As we look at what's happening [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  in Georgia and we look at the impact of these tariffs, they are directly impacting our small [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=131.92s)]
*  businesses. We hear business owners across the state saying that they are having to stockpile [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  their goods because of the tariffs. We know that people are having to make decisions about [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=143.27999999999997s)]
*  whether or not they keep employees because they are incurring the cost of the tariffs. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  And it's just more disruption and chaos that's coming from Donald Trump. So as governor, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=154.72s)]
*  I'm going to lean in on those things that will help our businesses survive and thrive during this [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=159.76s)]
*  time. Mayor, just a few blocks from where we are right now. You have members of Congress debating [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=167.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's big, beautiful bill. And one of the things with the sticking points is Medicaid work [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=172.64s)]
*  requirements. Your state offers a real warning about the limitations of those work requirements. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right. In Georgia, we are fighting to expand Medicaid. And what's interesting [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=186.72s)]
*  about that, I saw a recent poll that said 59% of Republicans in this state support Medicaid expansion. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  And because Georgia has not expanded Medicaid, nine rural hospitals have closed in this state. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=199.92s)]
*  300,000 people don't have health insurance. This means our children aren't insured because we've [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=206.56s)]
*  not expanded Medicaid. $710 million we've left on the table in Georgia because we've not expanded [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=213.52s)]
*  Medicaid. So we don't want cuts to Medicaid. We need to expand Medicaid in Georgia. And this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=221.12s)]
*  is something that's supported. It has bipartisan support in this state. And as we look at Georgia, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=227.52s)]
*  we rank the top 20 with people who have diabetes, top 20 with people who have high blood pressure, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=235.68s)]
*  top 20 with asthma. Our numbers aren't great in the South in general. So for Donald Trump [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=244.08s)]
*  and Republicans in Congress to try and roll back health care when we need to expand health care in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=250.96s)]
*  this country is disgraceful. And it's more the chaos that follows him as president. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=257.52s)]
*  Madam Mayor, you have had a very interesting journey to this point for sure. Former magistrate [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=266.16s)]
*  judge, former mayor, advisor to the president of the United States. And now seeking something that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=273.92s)]
*  like mayor puts you on the streets closer to the people of the great state of Georgia. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=281.04s)]
*  Without giving away any of the big trade secrets as you plan your campaign, how do you see winning [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=287.52s)]
*  this election? How do you see making the case to the people of Georgia in an environment where [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=293.12s)]
*  you've got the push and pull of national politics that may be defining your state [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=304.24s)]
*  and your actions as mayor one way and trying to convince the people of your state how you [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=311.76s)]
*  will govern as governor? Well, thank you for sharing my resume. You left off a day. I spent [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=318.64s)]
*  eight years on the Atlanta City Council as well. So, you know, when you are a member of the City [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=325.36s)]
*  Council, you are hearing directly from people. When you are a mayor, you hear directly from people [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=330.96s)]
*  because they can find you in the grocery store and they can find you in City Hall. But what I will do [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=336.24s)]
*  to win in the state are the things that I've done as a leader. I will lean into those policies that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=341.84s)]
*  make a difference to everyday folk. We will campaign the old-fashioned way. We'll do it the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=348.32s)]
*  new way. By that, I mean we will continue to knock on doors in this state. We will continue to call [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=353.28s)]
*  people on the telephone. We're going to post on social media and all the places where people get [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=360.48s)]
*  their information and you work to earn their votes by going in their communities, listening to what [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=365.68s)]
*  matters to them most. I have a great list of things I want to accomplish, but unless it mirrors [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=372.48s)]
*  what people are saying they want and need in their communities, then it's all for naught. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=378.72s)]
*  So we got to beat the pavement and earn the votes of the people across the state, fight back against [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  the chaos that's coming out of Washington. It's disruptive to our communities. It's disruptive [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=390.24s)]
*  to the people of Georgia, and people are looking for someone to fight. And that's why I'm offering [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=396.56s)]
*  myself as governor. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWNK4zxyvJ4&t=401.76s)]
