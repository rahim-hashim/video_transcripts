# 'Catastrophic' situation in Gaza is 'beyond dire': International Rescue Committee
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs)
*  Joining us now is David Miliband, International Rescue Committee President and CEO. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=0.0s)]
*  David, thanks for your time. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=6.04s)]
*  We're seeing and hearing these horrific accounts, just heartbreaking images too, out of Gaza [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=8.48s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=14.88s)]
*  What is your group hearing about the conditions on the ground in Gaza? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=15.88s)]
*  Thanks, Anna. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=20.64s)]
*  I think Matt Bradley has done a very good job in describing the situation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  We have about 40 International Rescue Committee staff, local staff, on the ground in Gaza. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=25.42s)]
*  We also have a dozen or so partner organizations. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=31.5s)]
*  They're focused on healthcare, on malnutrition, on protection of children. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=34.620000000000005s)]
*  And the situation is beyond dire. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=39.42s)]
*  It's a catastrophic situation. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=41.46s)]
*  The International Phase Classification System, which is a famine watchdog that assesses famine [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=43.660000000000004s)]
*  around the world, says that 500,000 people are at risk of famine and the whole population, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=49.54s)]
*  2 million, are suffering from high levels of food insecurity. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=55.86s)]
*  We ourselves have 27 pallets of medical equipment and some nutritional supplements that simply [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=61.62s)]
*  aren't being allowed in. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=68.82s)]
*  And this deadly weekend, the International Committee on the Red Cross said 20 to 30 people [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=70.82s)]
*  have died and 170 are injured just this weekend, shows you that this Gaza humanitarian forum [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=78.34s)]
*  is not working and is dangerous. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=85.14s)]
*  It's not the answer when there are much more straightforward ways of getting aid into Gaza. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=87.54s)]
*  So you talk about the aid you want to provide, that your group is ready to move in, and yet [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=93.06s)]
*  it's being blocked. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=100.22s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=101.5s)]
*  What reason are you given for not allowing that basic food and other necessities to come through? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=102.5s)]
*  Well, it's the situation that's been lasting since the last 13 weeks that there's been a blockade [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=111.62s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip, massive restrictions on what's allowed in. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  You may remember that before the October the 7th horror, there were about 500 to 600 trucks [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=123.94s)]
*  of aid going in a day. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=129.86s)]
*  Over the last 13 weeks, it's been effectively down to zero. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=132.58s)]
*  Over the last week, there have been between 10 and 90 trucks a day. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=135.46s)]
*  So you've got a massive squeeze that's being imposed on the people of the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=139.86s)]
*  We're a humanitarian organisation, not a political organisation. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=146.18s)]
*  What I can report is that civilians are suffering in a dire, dire way. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=150.06s)]
*  And the absolute necessity is twofold. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=155.9s)]
*  First of all, to release this blockade on the flow of aid and of commercial traffic. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=158.73999999999998s)]
*  Because of course, one of the problems with restrictions on aid is if it makes it more [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=164.7s)]
*  valuable, it makes it more valuable to loot. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=168.42s)]
*  The best way to overcome the looting is to get a flood of aid going in. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=170.38s)]
*  But the second thing, which is absolutely critical, is that the ceasefire talks are [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=174.45999999999998s)]
*  restarted with much more endeavour and much more progress. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=179.94s)]
*  Because there was progress in the six weeks before this blockade was imposed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=184.29999999999998s)]
*  And the reason is there was a ceasefire that allowed humanitarian organisations to do their work. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=188.54s)]
*  A spokesman for the UN humanitarian arm called Gaza the hungriest place on earth. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=193.5s)]
*  And said that 100% of the population of Gaza is at risk of famine. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=199.18s)]
*  You say there needs to be a flood of aid coming in. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  Is there any pressure that the Israeli government's under to make an adjustment at this point? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=209.5s)]
*  There's been this need for months and months now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=217.18s)]
*  Obviously, there's a massive responsibility on the Trump administration here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  We've seen the power of the administration. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=226.14s)]
*  I'm just back from Syria. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=228.06s)]
*  The Trump administration made a bold decision there. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=229.66s)]
*  It ended all sanctions on Syria. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=232.06s)]
*  There's a new government there that overthrew the Assad regime. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=234.94s)]
*  Boldness has built dividends there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=238.78s)]
*  There's hope and possibility in Syria. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=241.57999999999998s)]
*  My goodness, they've got their challenges. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=244.06s)]
*  But the Trump administration does have it within its power to make a difference. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=246.14s)]
*  Ehud Olmert, the former prime minister of Israel, said over the weekend that it was only the Trump administration that could have sway within Israeli politics. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=249.82s)]
*  Obviously, that's not our concern. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=258.94s)]
*  Our concern in the end is not how it gets done, but that it gets done. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=260.78s)]
*  And we know that there's desperate need. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=265.02s)]
*  You're flashing up some pictures of me in Syria. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=267.26s)]
*  We know that the Trump administration has the power when it chooses to use it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkYG8V2dZs&t=269.65999999999997s)]
