Video Description: MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell details how Donald Trump and his officials humiliated themselves as “economic illiterates” by claiming the Trump tariffs will not raise prices on U.S. consumers as they tried to “save themselves from the worst polls in the history of the first 100 days” by “pretending” to secretly negotiate a trade deal.

# Lawrence: 'Tariff scrooge' Trump is already killing U.S. jobs and has the worst 100-day polling ever
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI)
*  Well, as I understand it, having spent most of the day in the car, Donald Trump spent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=0.0s)]
*  the day talking about eating tariffs. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=5.96s)]
*  I mean, the guy will eat anything but tariffs? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=9.16s)]
*  As usual, it wasn't clear what Donald Trump actually meant by eating tariffs. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=13.72s)]
*  But Trump administration officials went on TV today to humiliate themselves as economic [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=19.2s)]
*  illiterates by claiming that the Trump tariffs will not raise prices in this country, which [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=25.16s)]
*  is exactly the very point of a tariff. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=33.0s)]
*  Because the Trump tariffs are going to raise prices dramatically in this country, Christmas [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=38.58s)]
*  will look very different if Donald Trump doesn't surrender in his tariff war with China. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=43.7s)]
*  And remember, only China has said, quote, we will fight till the end in the Trump tariff [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=51.06s)]
*  war. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=58.42s)]
*  Donald Trump has never said that about his tariff war with China, never said he'll fight [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=59.42s)]
*  to the end. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=63.940000000000005s)]
*  And no one working for Donald Trump has ever dared to say that they will fight to the end [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=65.02000000000001s)]
*  against China because they all know that Donald Trump might cave and surrender to China in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=69.34s)]
*  this trade war at any moment, as he already has done with some auto parts that are exported [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=74.36s)]
*  from China. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=80.86s)]
*  Donald Trump tried to explain today in Michigan that his caving on auto parts and giving up [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=81.86s)]
*  his own tariff scheme on auto parts was just a friendly gesture to the American automobile [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=88.3s)]
*  industry and the American auto workers so that they will actually have the parts they [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=94.9s)]
*  need to complete the building of cars here in the United States. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=100.14s)]
*  But America's biggest automaker, General Motors, today withdrew its previous profit projection [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=105.56s)]
*  for this year because the Trump tariffs will raise prices and will reduce sales and will [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=113.92s)]
*  make life more expensive for everyone in this country, which according to several projections [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=122.68s)]
*  now will send the Trump economy toward a recession. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=127.9s)]
*  Because the Trump tariffs will raise prices, 90% of the Christmas goods purchased in the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=133.24s)]
*  United States of America will be more expensive. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  The New York Times has this report on the scrooge effect of the Trump tariffs for this [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  coming Christmas. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  Quote, toy makers, children's shops and specialty retailers are pausing orders for the winter [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=153.08s)]
*  holidays as the import taxes cascade through supply chains. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=160.28s)]
*  Factories in China produce nearly 80% of all toys and 90% of Christmas goods sold in America. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=166.44s)]
*  Alarm in the industry is palpable with the companies predicting product shortages and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=177.72s)]
*  higher prices. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=182.64s)]
*  Some business owners citing how crucial holiday sales are to their bottom lines are consulting [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=184.24s)]
*  bankruptcy lawyers. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=191.34s)]
*  So some business owners who depend on Christmas spending are already in April consulting bankruptcy [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=193.88s)]
*  lawyers with 239 shopping days left before Christmas. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=201.24s)]
*  The always goofy Howard Letnick, Donald Trump's thoroughly unqualified and incompetent Commerce [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  Secretary tried to insist to CNBC's Brian Sullivan today that the Trump tariffs would [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=212.1s)]
*  not increase prices, which of course, Brian Sullivan and anyone else who knows anything [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=220.82s)]
*  about pricing could not accept. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=226.28s)]
*  If a company were to say we're raising prices because of the tariff, is that a hostile act? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=230.62s)]
*  I think if you go out of your way to try to make it seem like your price has changed when [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=235.06s)]
*  it's nonsense, okay? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=241.24s)]
*  A 10% tariff. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  Why is that nonsense? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=243.98000000000002s)]
*  Because a 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=244.98000000000002s)]
*  The only price it would change would be a product that we don't make here, like a mango. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=248.9s)]
*  Yeah, it was nonsense. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=255.02s)]
*  Brian Sullivan was right. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=257.86s)]
*  That interview then went off the rails in mango land with the utterly ignorant Letnick [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=259.74s)]
*  changing the subject so that it never went back to a point where Brian Sullivan could [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=265.2s)]
*  pursue the essence of what the most ignorant Commerce Secretary in history about the subject [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=270.32s)]
*  of tariffs just said on TV. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=276.24s)]
*  Howard Letnick actually said a 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=279.2s)]
*  So adding 10% to the cost of a product when it enters the United States will have no effect [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=290.24s)]
*  on the price of that product, according to Howard Letnick. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=297.42s)]
*  And that is where Donald Trump's eating tariff comes in. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=301.78s)]
*  Donald Trump is obviously not a mango guy, so he mumbled his way through an interview [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=306.7s)]
*  about eating tariffs without mentioning any food products that actually can be eaten. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=311.26s)]
*  It'll raise prices on everything from electronics to clothing to building houses. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=318.7s)]
*  You don't know that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=323.41999999999996s)]
*  You don't know whether or not China's going to eat it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=324.41999999999996s)]
*  China probably will eat those tariffs. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=327.02s)]
*  Remember when Donald Trump and the campaign trail said China will probably eat the tariffs. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=331.56s)]
*  No, you don't because he never said that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=336.96s)]
*  We're going to be a tariff nation. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=341.68s)]
*  It's not going to be a cost to you. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=343.47999999999996s)]
*  It's going to be a cost to another country. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=345.06s)]
*  I heard Kamala the other day, comrade Kamala. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=347.0s)]
*  She said, Oh, if you do that, he's raising your taxes. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=350.64s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=354.12s)]
*  I'm not raising your taxes. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=355.12s)]
*  I'm raising China and all of these countries in Asia and all over the world. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=356.68s)]
*  Imagine if any country could actually raise the taxes in another country. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=365.74s)]
*  What Donald Trump appears to mean and what Howard Blutnick appears to mean is that Chinese [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  exporters will lower the price by the amount of the tariff, which in China's case is 145%. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=377.98s)]
*  A $100 product exported from China will somehow still cost $100 in the United States because [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=387.86s)]
*  the producer of that product in China is going to reduce the export price on $100 item by [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=394.78000000000003s)]
*  $145. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=402.14000000000004s)]
*  If you're trying to do that math in your head, you can stop now. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=406.08s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=408.88s)]
*  And that is why stores that sell toys and Christmas products are canceling their orders [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=409.88s)]
*  for Christmas and consulting bankruptcy lawyers because they know that Americans are not going [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  to pay 145% more for a Christmas decoration for their tree or for their toys. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=422.36s)]
*  And those stores do not want to be stuck with products that they cannot sell and they will [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=429.79999999999995s)]
*  not be able to sell in December. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=435.28s)]
*  And oh, by the way, they cannot decide to order those products in November because of [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=437.64s)]
*  that thing we all learned about in COVID, the supply chain, which takes a while. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=442.08s)]
*  Supply chain is already slowing down dramatically and putting Americans out of work right now. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=447.28s)]
*  The supply chain from China primarily enters the United States on the West Coast with the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=453.46s)]
*  Port of Los Angeles taking most of it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=457.64s)]
*  The executive director of the Port of Los Angeles told CNBC that he, quote, expects [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=461.08s)]
*  incoming cargo volume to slide by more than a third next week compared with the same period [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=466.88s)]
*  in 2024. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=473.96s)]
*  The West Coast Stock Workers Union issued this statement today, quote, these tariffs [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=475.56s)]
*  are nothing more than a direct attack on working class and should be opposed outright. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=480.68s)]
*  The reality is clear. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  These tariffs don't put America first. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=487.86s)]
*  They put American working people last. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=489.98s)]
*  They will kill jobs, raise costs and fuel economic instability that will ripple through [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=492.34000000000003s)]
*  every community in this country. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=498.1s)]
*  So the Trump tariffs are already killing jobs in this country like truck driving jobs at [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=501.66s)]
*  the Port of Los Angeles, which makes it all the more ludicrous when the Trump team tries [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=507.62s)]
*  to tell you that tariffs do not raise prices in this country. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=514.56s)]
*  The sunniest face in Trump world is always the permanently smiling Kevin Hassett, the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=521.2199999999999s)]
*  White House National Economic Council director. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=527.5s)]
*  Nothing can make him stop smiling. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=531.2199999999999s)]
*  He doesn't do the Peter Navarro scowl talking about China. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=533.0799999999999s)]
*  He doesn't look like a clown the way Howard Blutnick always does talking about mangoes [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=536.9s)]
*  on TV. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=541.66s)]
*  And Kevin Hassett doesn't talk about eating tariffs the way Donald Trump does. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=542.92s)]
*  He tries to use economist speak to fake out interviewers, to make them think he actually [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=547.4599999999999s)]
*  knows what he is talking about. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=554.0799999999999s)]
*  And the tell in what you're about to hear is Kevin Hassett, a graduate of Swarthmore [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  College who obtained his PhD in economics at the nearby University of Pennsylvania, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=563.48s)]
*  uses the word inelastic. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=570.46s)]
*  That is a word most people go through their entire lives without ever hearing or speaking, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=574.0600000000001s)]
*  inelastic. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=578.98s)]
*  It's a word that comes up in every introductory course on economics in college along with [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=579.98s)]
*  the word elastic. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=586.34s)]
*  In those courses we talk about elastic demand, meaning demand that can go up and down, and [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=588.34s)]
*  inelastic demand, meaning demand that stays very steady, and we talk about elastic supply, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=593.7s)]
*  like the supply of toys in December this year, for example, which is obviously elastic, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=599.44s)]
*  according to what we just heard, because the orders are being canceled for those toys right now. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=605.2s)]
*  And then there's inelastic demand, just a permanent demand that almost never declines [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=610.9200000000001s)]
*  in any significant way. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=616.08s)]
*  The demand for energy is extremely consistent, which economists would sometimes call inelastic, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=617.48s)]
*  as an example of inelastic supply. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=624.24s)]
*  Listen to the way the always smiling Trump economist sneaks in the word inelastic to [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=628.4599999999999s)]
*  say something that is absolutely impossible and get away with it because he's using those [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=636.78s)]
*  words that he learned at the University of Pennsylvania. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=643.8s)]
*  The question put to him today was about Donald Trump calling up Jeff Bezos, the owner-operator [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=647.88s)]
*  of Amazon, to complain about a story from Axios saying Amazon was considering identifying [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=653.5600000000001s)]
*  the tariff increase in prices on the website. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  Put it right there on the website with their pricing. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=667.24s)]
*  But after Jeff Bezos got that call, Amazon's Washington lobbyist put out a statement saying, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=670.46s)]
*  Amazon would never do that. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=677.36s)]
*  Jeff would never do that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=678.48s)]
*  He would never tell our consumers on Amazon what Donald Trump has done to their prices. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=680.36s)]
*  We live in a country where there are gas pumps in America that show you exactly how many [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=687.12s)]
*  pennies in the price of a gallon of gas is for the federal gas tax and exactly how many [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=694.12s)]
*  pennies in the price of a gallon of gas is for that state gas tax that you pay in a gallon [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=700.84s)]
*  of gasoline. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=706.6s)]
*  But no, Amazon will never let you know how much the Trump tariffs are adding to your [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=707.86s)]
*  prices and Amazon's Jeff Bezos has promised Donald Trump he'll never ever let Amazon [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=713.54s)]
*  customers know that as if they can't figure it out for themselves. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=720.1s)]
*  Here's how Kevin Hassett responded to that news about the Trump Bezos phone call. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=726.74s)]
*  Now when you listen to this, listen for the word if, always a very important word with [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=732.86s)]
*  economists. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=737.96s)]
*  Listen to the word if and the absolute impossible hypothetical that comes after the word if. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=738.96s)]
*  The bottom line is that if we charge a tariff on a foreign country, that if they have inelastic [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=751.12s)]
*  supply to us, then the supplier in that country is going to bear the tariff, not the U.S. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=757.4200000000001s)]
*  consumer. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=762.1s)]
*  And the idea that Amazon is going to say that the tariff is passing through to the consumer [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=763.1s)]
*  means that they don't understand economics. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=766.78s)]
*  And so you covered it as a debacle. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=768.54s)]
*  I did think it was a debacle for whoever's doing economics at Amazon because they were [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=770.22s)]
*  assuming something that's contrary to basic economics about who bears the tariff. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=773.9s)]
*  And it was correct for Jeff Bezos to apologize for it and to correct the record that Amazon, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=778.54s)]
*  whoever did it, made a big mistake. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=783.1800000000001s)]
*  I wonder if they'll have a job tomorrow. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=784.46s)]
*  Now there's a guy who should not have a job. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=788.0600000000001s)]
*  He should not have the job that he has. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=791.14s)]
*  He is an undistinguished economist who has never done anything important in the world [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=792.8199999999999s)]
*  of economics, never been cited by other economists. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=799.26s)]
*  And there's the smiling economist who's never accepted an invitation to appear on this program [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=804.2199999999999s)]
*  telling you that prices will not go up in this country for any product that has inelastic [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=809.9799999999999s)]
*  supply. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=817.6199999999999s)]
*  And he says inelastic supply really fast. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=818.7s)]
*  Sounds really cool when he says it like he really knows something. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=822.18s)]
*  That is an economist's hypothetical, which like most economists' hypotheticals have absolutely [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=825.5s)]
*  no meaning in the real world. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=830.58s)]
*  You would think that Christmas toys are about as close as you could get to something with [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=833.14s)]
*  both inelastic demand and inelastic supply, a supply that simply must keep flowing. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=838.38s)]
*  But toy sellers in America are already talking to bankruptcy lawyers because they know that [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=844.16s)]
*  that hypothetical about inelastic supply that the smiling man just said is utter nonsense [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=850.6s)]
*  and that it is mathematically impossible for any exporter in China to lower the price of [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=858.04s)]
*  their products by 145%. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=864.1999999999999s)]
*  And so this is the new game. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=867.36s)]
*  Donald Trump now says China will probably eat the tariffs. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=869.04s)]
*  During the campaign, he used to say very simply, China will pay those tariffs. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=875.0s)]
*  Just pay them. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=879.16s)]
*  You don't have to worry about them. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=880.16s)]
*  China will step up and pay a tariff that's supposed to be paid by us. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  How generous of China. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=887.16s)]
*  The vast majority of voters now know exactly who's going to pay the tariffs. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=889.1999999999999s)]
*  People who have never heard the phrase inelastic supply know much better than economics PhD [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=894.84s)]
*  Kevin Hassett who is going to pay the tariffs. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=902.2s)]
*  Americans know they are going to pay the tariffs. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=905.4s)]
*  Americans know that the only money that is going to flow into the United States Treasury [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=909.24s)]
*  from tariffs will come from Americans in America and no one else. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=914.0s)]
*  It is legally and technically impossible for tariff revenue to be paid by anyone outside [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=921.04s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=929.64s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=932.24s)]
*  No tariff money has ever flowed into the United States Treasury from another country. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=933.52s)]
*  Only from the ports receiving products in the United States. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=939.16s)]
*  On extremely low tariffs, on products that have high profit margins, an extremely low [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=945.56s)]
*  tariff, it is conceivable that say a 4% tariff on a product might provoke the foreign producer [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  of that high profit product to reduce their export price by 4%. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=958.64s)]
*  So after the tariff is paid at the port of entry by say Best Buy importing a TV, the [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=964.56s)]
*  price of that TV at Best Buy could remain the same. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=970.1999999999999s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that the foreign country paid the tariff. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=974.6s)]
*  Best Buy paid the tariff at the dock which means Americans paid the tariff and ultimately [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=979.64s)]
*  Best Buy customers will all pay the tariff when Best Buy spreads out that cost of the [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=985.5600000000001s)]
*  tariff on that TV over all of the products that it sells in its stores. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=992.36s)]
*  And if Best Buy is lucky, they'd be able to spread out the cost of that tariff on the [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=998.6800000000001s)]
*  TV in small enough shares and all the other products sold in the store that you wouldn't [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1002.96s)]
*  really notice the small price changes. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1007.08s)]
*  But the trouble with that example is that Donald Trump has put a tariff on every single [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1008.96s)]
*  product that Best Buy sells, every single one of them. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1016.2800000000001s)]
*  And that is why in new polling today, the tariff scrooge, Donald Trump, is getting a [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1020.2s)]
*  grade of F on his first 100 days from 45% of Americans. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1025.24s)]
*  55% say they disapprove of how Donald Trump is handling his job and only 39% approve. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1031.44s)]
*  64% disapprove of Donald Trump's tariffs because they understand them. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1038.88s)]
*  72% say they think it's very or somewhat likely that his economic policies will cause a recession. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1044.56s)]
*  89%, a number seemingly unachievable in political polling in this country. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1052.56s)]
*  And 89% think the Trump tariffs are likely to result in higher prices on the products [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1059.64s)]
*  they buy no matter what the smiling economist says. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1067.3600000000001s)]
*  The tariff scrooge has the worst polling numbers in the history of polling at the end of 100 [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1072.44s)]
*  days of a presidency. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1079.16s)]
*  And now to try to save themselves from the worst polls in the history of the first 100 [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1081.72s)]
*  days of presidencies, the Trump team is pretending that for the first time in history, the United [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1087.0800000000002s)]
*  States has secretly negotiated a trade deal. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1091.92s)]
*  That's never happened before and can never happen. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1094.8400000000001s)]
*  And see if you can catch why in Howard Lutnick's ridiculous statement about this secret deal [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1098.3600000000001s)]
*  today. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1105.8400000000001s)]
*  I have a deal done, done, done, done. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1107.8400000000001s)]
*  But I need to wait for their prime minister and their parliament to give its approval, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1111.3600000000001s)]
*  which I expect shortly. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1115.88s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you what country. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1116.88s)]
*  Let the president decide. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1118.44s)]
*  It's just you and me here and a couple million people hopefully watching. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1119.44s)]
*  I'll let the president decide. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1121.88s)]
*  And then there are country after country where we're just working through the details. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1123.6000000000001s)]
*  But you have to remember they have prime ministers, they have parliament, they have to work through [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1127.0400000000002s)]
*  their process. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1130.8400000000001s)]
*  But all of these are going to be coming. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1131.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they have prime ministers in parliaments. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1134.3200000000002s)]
*  He just found that out. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1137.68s)]
*  And that's one of the many reasons why trade negotiations have always been public, because [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1139.0400000000002s)]
*  trade negotiations between heads of state mean absolutely nothing and must always be [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1144.36s)]
*  approved by the parliament or in this country by the Congress. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1149.2s)]
*  The last time Donald Trump did a trade deal and the only time it was a very simple revision [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1152.8s)]
*  and update of NAFTA. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1157.52s)]
*  And that was, of course, approved by Congress. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1159.6s)]
*  And nothing was final in the deal until the Canadian parliament and the Mexican and the [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1162.76s)]
*  United States Congress and Mexico and their Congress approved it. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1168.76s)]
*  So in other words, Howard Lutnick and the Trump team, who have promised 90 trade deals [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1173.68s)]
*  in 90 days, are now 18 days into that promise with zero trade deals. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1177.44s)]
*  And no trade deal since the invention of the telephone has ever been negotiated and completed [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1184.3600000000001s)]
*  in any form, first draft form even, in less than 90 days. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzSs5vKZWI&t=1192.0800000000002s)]
