# 'Relentless pressure': ICE 'miserable' as they attempt to meet Trump quotas
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg)
*  Joining me now NBC's Ryan Nobles has been reporting on these raids in California [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=0.0s)]
*  Also here Nick Miroff staff writer at the Atlantic who spoke to more than a dozen current and former ICE agents about morale [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=4.7s)]
*  Problems inside the agency. It's good to have both of you Ryan. What else can you tell us about this cannabis farm raid in California? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=12.36s)]
*  Well, this was a massive facility Chris [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=20.3s)]
*  5.5 million acres in all indoors in Southern, California in the town of Camarillo and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=23.16s)]
*  What happened is that these ICE agents diss the Senate upon this facility under the the folks at the glass house farms were unaware [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=30.0s)]
*  Of it at the time [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=37.32s)]
*  They did say that they fully complied with the requests by the agents to enter into the facility [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  And look for people who they were were targets of this raid [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=44.04s)]
*  Listen to how one of the workers at the facility described how it went down [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=47.6s)]
*  There were it just went went in without expecting there was a lot of people [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=53.44s)]
*  There was just a lot of like if there were and were something they came they guns drawn and everything [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=59.04s)]
*  They came then you know what else can do that? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=66.6s)]
*  We got surrounded they close everything the whole cars went and there were the whole password we could run there were there on [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=69.2s)]
*  blocked off [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=76.84s)]
*  And of course this raid led to a massive protest in and around the facility clashes between [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=79.68s)]
*  Protesters and the ICE agents and other law enforcement that were there on the scene [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=85.56s)]
*  the law enforcement responding with tear gas and then there was even one protester that's accused of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=90.48s)]
*  Firing a shot in the direction of law enforcement the FBI right now issuing it a reward for the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=96.28s)]
*  For anyone that could find and help them locate the person responsible for firing that shot [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  But Chris at the very least this shows just how high tensions are right now [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  particularly in this part of the country around [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=114.0s)]
*  Facilities like this farm which President Trump has said that they're working to try and find some sort of carve out in this immigration [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=116.84s)]
*  Enforcement crackdown that would allow these farms to continue to use migrant labor Chris [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  Ryan Nobles, thank you for that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  So Nick the president has publicly praised ice but NBC News has new reporting that Stephen Miller who we know has his ear is [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=131.36s)]
*  Upset that that immigration arrests have fallen from a recent high of a 2300 a day to under [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=139.0s)]
*  2000 what can you tell us about the pressure agents are feeling right now? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=145.4s)]
*  Sure. Well, there is a relentless pressure coming down from the White House on ice on rank-and-file officers and agents [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  Who are feel like they you know, they have to meet these [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=160.08s)]
*  These these numbers that they're you know, they told me were like a mission impossible we're talking about [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=164.52s)]
*  levels of arrests that are five and six times what they were doing before and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=171.92s)]
*  They simply don't have the resources the personnel [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=176.36s)]
*  You know to to meet what Miller and others at the White House are demanding of them and that's you know [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=179.76s)]
*  One of the big factors that has led to lower [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  You know low morale at the agency and many agents and officers saying they're you know [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=189.72s)]
*  More miserable in their jobs right now than they've ever been [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=195.76s)]
*  The Seattle Times Nick describes another scene beyond the ones we just showed where with tire screeching some [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=198.72s)]
*  FCUVs pulled up along the main drag [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  People came out masked some of them with protective vests and agents quote [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=208.76s)]
*  Grabbed a woman known as the food lady because she sells food in the community along with other street vendors as they were walking off a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=213.78s)]
*  Bystander shouted out to the ice agents. What kind of people are you? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=221.9s)]
*  Some agents I know you talked to are acutely aware of the fact that they've become a kind of persona non grata in some places [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=227.74s)]
*  Tell us more about how they're feeling about how they're perceived. I [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=234.74s)]
*  Mean certainly there are agents out there that are all in on the president's orders and are thrilled to be doing this kind of work [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=240.06s)]
*  But I think that that glass is over the the many others who feel conflicted about what they're doing [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=248.26s)]
*  They signed up to be federal law enforcement agents [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=252.62s)]
*  They thought you know, they want to be out there catching criminals and you know protecting the country from national security threats [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=255.9s)]
*  And instead they're under this incredible pressure to meet their quotas [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=262.42s)]
*  And so they're being sent out to go to go for the lowest hanging fruit so to speak of you know [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=266.5s)]
*  The easiest people to arrest and a lot of times those are you know [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=271.7s)]
*  You know poor people who are out on the street who who they you know, they could be profiling [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=275.3s)]
*  They think that they you know, they may be arrestable and so they're grabbing them and it's it's sort of the lowest quality [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=280.18s)]
*  Type of immigration enforcement work and it shouldn't be a surprise that a lot of these agents feel really conflicted about that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=287.14s)]
*  And at the same time they know that the public is furious they go out when they go out in public [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=294.06s)]
*  They're getting you know screamed at they're they're being confronted by activists [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=298.82s)]
*  And so they're they're you know masking up and and sort of retreating behind all this tactical gear and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=302.62s)]
*  They know that in the long term it really under under it really undermines the agency and the perception of ice in the public [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=308.5s)]
*  Even if they're not rounding up the number of people that say Stephen Miller would like them to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=315.78s)]
*  Obviously they are continuing to round people up we know for example that they open alligator Alcatraz down in Florida [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=321.34s)]
*  Do they have even the infrastructure to keep up? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=328.34s)]
*  Well, they haven't had the infrastructure to keep up there only been funded for about 40,000, you know detainees in their detention centers per day [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=331.34s)]
*  Right now they're close to 60,000. So their their detention centers are massively overcrowded and conditions continue to deteriorate [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=340.34s)]
*  But let's remember that Congress just gave DHS and ICE tens of billions of dollars and you know almost unimaginable amount of funding [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=349.34s)]
*  Including about 45 billion dollars to expand detention facilities across the United States [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=358.34s)]
*  So they now have the money to try to carry out the kind of mass deportation campaign that Trump has demanded of them [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=364.34s)]
*  And the next phase I think we can we can expect that that all of this all these tensions all of the scenes that you're seeing are going to really intensify [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=372.34s)]
*  And you know, they they are capable of arresting and deporting a lot more people than they have been doing so far [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=381.34s)]
*  People who want to read more of your reporting can find it in the Atlantic Nick Miroff. Thanks for coming on the show [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=388.34s)]
*  You [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7BlHokZcg&t=401.34s)]
