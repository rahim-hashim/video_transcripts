# ‘Next level of strategic planning’: Veteran calls Israeli attack ‘future’ of warfare
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc)
*  I want to bring in Paul Ryckhoff, an independent national security analyst and an Iraq War [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=0.0s)]
*  veteran, retired Army Lieutenant General Steph Twitty, who served as deputy commander of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=4.48s)]
*  U.S. European Command and is an MSNBC military analyst, and Hagar Shamali, former spokesperson [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  for the U.S. Mission to the U.N. and former NSC director for Syria and Lebanon, joins [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=14.16s)]
*  me in studio. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=18.72s)]
*  Paul, I'll start with you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=19.72s)]
*  What can you tell us about what it takes to pull something like this off? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=21.06s)]
*  I think it might take genius. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=25.6s)]
*  I mean, this is really a next level of strategic planning, intelligence gathering, coordination, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=26.96s)]
*  security and execution. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  And this is, in many ways, the future of what warfare will look like, especially the extensive [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=35.68s)]
*  use of drones. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  And I think it comes on the backs of the September of last year Israeli operation involving the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  beepers where they took down Hezbollah leaders that took patience and coordination and tremendous [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=45.92s)]
*  advanced planning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  And we see a similar level of innovation and creativity on the Iraqi... [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=51.78s)]
*  Sorry, check that, the Ukrainian battlefield where we saw Operation Spider a couple of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=55.96s)]
*  weeks ago. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=60.24s)]
*  This is the future of warfare. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=61.24s)]
*  And I think it's also a reminder to the United States of what we need to be prepared for [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  from our enemies. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  Drones are the future. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  It's not rolling tanks through Eastern Europe anymore. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  This is what the future of a technology-based, drone-driven type of warfare looks like. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=71.76s)]
*  And in the days to come, I think we will be impressed with the military precision of what [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=77.04s)]
*  it took to pull this off. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=81.04s)]
*  We are seeing deadly creativity in several of these conflicts here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=82.84s)]
*  So General, what kind of planning goes into an operation like this? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=87.0s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, this planning was not coordinated in days, not even months. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=90.84s)]
*  I spent a lot of time in Israel. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=99.84s)]
*  I spent a lot of time talking about this particular subject with the Israelis. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=102.24s)]
*  This has been in the planning for years. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=107.98s)]
*  And so because it's been in the planning for years, intelligence has been focused on it [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=111.92s)]
*  for years. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=116.4s)]
*  The military stance and how they would go about it, been focused on for years. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=117.68s)]
*  Developing the informants inside Iran to provide the great intelligence information, and not [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=124.52s)]
*  just the intelligence information, but the cooperation necessary to get the drones into [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=132.6s)]
*  Iran, that had to be coordinated. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=141.6s)]
*  And so you got to develop those within the country itself. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=144.56s)]
*  The other part of this, if you think about Hezbollah, they have been decimated by the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=148.88s)]
*  Israelis. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  And because they were the ones that were pretty much along the border between Lebanon and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=157.76s)]
*  Israel, focused more on the security just north of the Golan Heights, when they were [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=163.52s)]
*  decimated, that left a window for the Israelis to smuggle certain weapon systems, certain [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=169.84s)]
*  people through the Golan Heights, up through Syria, into Iran. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=177.84s)]
*  And so we cannot forget about, if you take a look at Hezbollah and their stance, that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=183.52s)]
*  leaves a huge board for the Israelis also to put capabilities, sources, and so forth [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=189.4s)]
*  into Iran undetected. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=197.0s)]
*  Yeah, the proxy groups, a key piece of this equation. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=199.04s)]
*  Hagar, as you look at the fact that this was obviously pre-planned, it's something that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=202.08s)]
*  Netanyahu had been saying he wanted to do for years, but certainly in recent weeks against [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=206.24s)]
*  the Trump administration's wishes, do you imagine that there could be more planned as [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=210.96s)]
*  they say that they could continue with this for several days or an undetermined amount [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=214.96s)]
*  of time? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=219.28s)]
*  Where do you think this goes next, and what does that look like? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=219.84s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=222.0s)]
*  So for sure, there's going to be more coming up ahead, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=222.32s)]
*  And Prime Minister Netanyahu has said that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  But we have to underscore, and the general noted this, right, that something like this [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=227.68s)]
*  is definitely planned for years. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=231.12s)]
*  Planning for years, but what was Israel looking for in order to precipitate this? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=233.12s)]
*  It's a few things. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=237.6s)]
*  Number one, you had a report that came out a month ago from the IAEA, the International [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  Atomic Energy Agency, saying that Iran had been, that their stockpile of weapons-grade [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=242.56s)]
*  enriched uranium had surged by 50 percent. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=250.24s)]
*  That's while they were negotiating with the Trump administration. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=253.12s)]
*  And that they could create 10 nuclear weapons. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=256.4s)]
*  So number one, they had this argument that it could be preemptive. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=258.47999999999996s)]
*  Number two, they had the argument that they could say, listen, there were talks under [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=261.35999999999996s)]
*  Obama, there were talks under Trump, and nothing is working. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=264.47999999999996s)]
*  And the third, and this is the most important, is that Israel proved last fall that the Iranian [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  regime is the emperor without any clothes. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=273.12s)]
*  Not only any new clothes, they targeted their defense missile systems. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=274.64s)]
*  They had the emperor with no underwear even. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=278.0s)]
*  And so they knew that they were targeting something, that they could target something [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  where their ability to respond is minimal. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=284.32s)]
*  They have no allies, no missile defense systems. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  And I explain this why, because this is Israel's chance now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=289.44s)]
*  So they're not going to do it half-baked. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=293.2s)]
*  They're going to say they're going to finish it all the way through. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=296.88s)]
*  And that is going to really crumble this axis of resistance once and for all. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=300.48s)]
*  And that is really the question here, right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=304.56s)]
*  Because we've had everyone from the former defense secretary, Leon Panetta, to Ben Rhodes, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=306.16s)]
*  who was integral in the White House, Obama White House's negotiation of that first Iran [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=310.0s)]
*  nuclear deal, say that all of this comes down for Israel to how well can they actually decimate [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=314.24s)]
*  the nuclear sites there? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=320.16s)]
*  Based on what you've seen, what do you think? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=321.36s)]
*  I think they can do it quite well. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=323.84s)]
*  I don't think they would have done it if they couldn't do it well, knowing that this was [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=324.96s)]
*  their one chance, something they had discussed for years. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=328.64s)]
*  And I don't want to undermine the dangers at risk here. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=331.52s)]
*  You're going to see Iran pursue retaliation probably through its paramilitaries and proxies [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=333.92s)]
*  where they can against U.S. and Israeli interests. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=339.2s)]
*  But just as we've seen over the last year and a half and any other time we saw things [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=341.84s)]
*  escalate and everybody screamed, oh my gosh, it's going to be World War III, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=346.64s)]
*  that's not what happened or transpired. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=350.56s)]
*  And that's why I have a lot of hope that I don't think the Israeli government would [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=352.32s)]
*  have pursued it if they thought they'd get sucked in to a massive long-term war. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=355.36s)]
*  This, I can't tell you how long it's going to last, but I don't think it would be fair. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=360.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's an interesting perspective there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=363.36s)]
*  I think, Paul, you said something about how drone warfare and this kind of creativity [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=365.12s)]
*  that we've seen is the kind of war of the future, but it comes against the backdrop [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  of a military parade here in D.C. tomorrow that will feature what I guess you could say [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  the warfare of the past, things like tanks rolling through the streets. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=378.56s)]
*  I mean, what does that say to the rest of the world about where the U.S. is [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=382.48s)]
*  and our level of preparation for this? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=386.48s)]
*  Well, I think more importantly, what it says to the world is that our president has hijacked [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=389.6s)]
*  the military for political purposes for his own birthday parade. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=394.24s)]
*  I think that is a larger message. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  But when it comes down to our strategic preparedness, we have not produced enough drones. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=399.36s)]
*  I mean, that is something we need to accelerate. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=404.48s)]
*  Absolutely Ukraine has shown us that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=406.48s)]
*  The world has shown us that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=408.56s)]
*  And that's the type of focus we need to massively mobilize our industrial base to get more training, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=409.76s)]
*  to get more acceptance of what the future of modern warfare looks like. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=415.68s)]
*  And it's also, frankly, a painful reminder that an enemy can pull up a truck full of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=419.2s)]
*  drones anywhere in America and let them loose. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=423.36s)]
*  And that's a new kind of threat that we have to be prepared for, we have to be ready for. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  I also think there's another piece of this that this attack reveals. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  The world doesn't have to ask for America's permission anymore. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=432.8s)]
*  Israel can move forward independently even if Trump opposes it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=435.68s)]
*  Trump can't stop Ukraine from doing things, can't stop Russia from doing things. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=439.68s)]
*  So I think we're moving toward a new normal where America can't dictate the terms [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=443.44s)]
*  to the rest of the world. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=447.76s)]
*  And they don't have to ask for our permission or even tell us if they're going to do things. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=448.8s)]
*  And that is, I think, in part a reflection of how isolated we have become [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=452.4s)]
*  under the Trump administration and how much less safe we are as a nation. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJ4arfnTcc&t=455.76s)]
