# ‘Extraordinary moment’: Trump meets with Syrian president after pledge to lift sanctions
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck)
*  Peter, first day of this trip, heavy on business deals. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=0.0s)]
*  What do we know about the conversations that the president is having with Qatari leaders [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=4.44s)]
*  right now? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=8.5s)]
*  Yeah, heavy on business deals day one and now on day two. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=10.6s)]
*  The president's own words saying his focus is on commerce over chaos throughout this [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=15.1s)]
*  region, the U.S. today alongside the Emir of Qatar announcing, President Trump announcing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=19.44s)]
*  $1.2 trillion deal, shared investments between the two countries, including $96 billion in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=25.28s)]
*  Qatari purchases of Boeing and GE aerospace, built airplanes and engines, one of the largest [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=31.92s)]
*  deals the president says that Boeing has ever seen. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=38.08s)]
*  Here's part of what we heard of the president after his visit with the Emir of Qatar only [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=40.92s)]
*  a short time ago. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=45.64s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=46.64s)]
*  We discussed the world. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=48.64s)]
*  We discussed Russia and Ukraine where you've been a tremendous help in so many different [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=51.24s)]
*  ways. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=56.68s)]
*  We certainly discussed Iran where it's been really an interesting situation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=57.68s)]
*  I have a feeling it's going to work out. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=64.0s)]
*  I think it's going to work. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=65.52s)]
*  It's got to work out one way or the other. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=66.52s)]
*  We know it's going to work out, but you were of great help and other things, but in particular [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=67.92s)]
*  the trade is the Kelly's telling me from Boeing, it's the largest order of jets in the history [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=76.92s)]
*  of Boeing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=83.08s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=84.08s)]
*  The president has been reveling in the glitzy receptions he has received across this region [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=87.68s)]
*  so far. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=92.8s)]
*  First in Saudi Arabia where there was a fighter jet escort for Air Force One as it arrived [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=93.8s)]
*  in Riyadh today, another fighter jet escort there in Riyadh. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=97.68s)]
*  He was greeted by Arabian horses here by a contingent of camels. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=101.44s)]
*  The president certainly enjoying the personal relationships he has with some of the leaders [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=105.92s)]
*  in this country, including of course with the Saudi Grand Prince Mohammed bin Salman [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  who the U.S. assessed was responsible ultimately for ordering the murder of the Washington [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=113.56s)]
*  Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=119.0s)]
*  That all though seems like ancient history right now as the president has been leaning [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=120.88s)]
*  heavily into the personal relationships he says he has with these leaders and how he [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=124.46s)]
*  says they will benefit Americans. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=129.04s)]
*  Chris? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=131.32s)]
*  Thank you Peter for that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=133.0s)]
*  Michael, one of the biggest surprises to come out of this trip is Trump announcing that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=134.0s)]
*  the U.S. will lift sanctions on Syria and work toward normalizing relations. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=138.12s)]
*  What do you know about how and why the administration came to this decision and what it's asking [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=142.92s)]
*  from Syria in return? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  Well Chris, you know what strikes me about this president is his willingness to talk [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=153.56s)]
*  to anyone. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=160.11999999999998s)]
*  The current leader of Syria is a former ISIS member who had a bounty on his head, an FBI [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=161.6s)]
*  bounty, I believe it was $10 million, it might have been more, until several months ago. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=170.04s)]
*  And there were, I mean I reported a lot on this when he took power and there were a lot [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=176.72s)]
*  of Biden administration officials who were very skeptical of this guy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=181.56s)]
*  They weren't sure whether the U.S. should be dealing with him at all, even at a lower [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=185.1s)]
*  level. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=189.22s)]
*  And here comes President Trump and he sits right down with him. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=190.22s)]
*  And so A, he's willing to talk to anyone and there are very definite pitfalls to that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=194.7s)]
*  You can kind of blunder into something without understanding what you're doing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=200.32s)]
*  In the case of Kim Jong-un in North Korea, I think there were a lot of concerns that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=203.92s)]
*  President Trump was essentially being used by a leader who was trying to legitimize and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  normalize his image on the world stage without giving much in return. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  But the other piece of this is that, you know, as this whole trip shows, President Trump [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=217.92s)]
*  is looking at the Middle East through very economic terms. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=221.88s)]
*  And there's a lot of talk right now about post-war Syria, rebuilding, redeveloping, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=225.0s)]
*  you know, that really gets his pulse going and gets him excited. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=229.39999999999998s)]
*  So I think that he sees most likely opportunity there. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  I also think that some other leaders in the region probably encouraged him to do this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=236.28s)]
*  because they want to get relations with Syria on a normalized track and feel like even if [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=240.28s)]
*  they have skepticism about the Syrian leader right now and his background, I think they [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=245.64s)]
*  want to try to work with him and bring him into a more mainstream fold. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=252.16s)]
*  So Mark, again, Trump framed this decision on Syria as kind of a favor to MBS. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=258.32s)]
*  He also said, and he likes this, that that was the announcement that got the biggest [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=265.96s)]
*  applause in the room when he said he was going to lift those sanctions. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  But what does it mean for Syria and more importantly, arguably for the region for these sanctions [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=273.96s)]
*  to be lifted? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=278.68s)]
*  So this is really an extraordinary moment, you know, for many Syria watchers, those of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=281.14s)]
*  us who've worked on the country for a long time. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=284.44s)]
*  You know, what happened during the Syrian civil war was tragic. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=287.08s)]
*  Half a million Syrians were killed. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  Millions were displaced. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=291.5s)]
*  The regime of Bashar al-Assad was truly an evil, terrible entity. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=292.66s)]
*  And then, of course, you have this new leader come in, Ahmed Shada, who is certainly al-Qaeda [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=297.7s)]
*  curious, had a price on his head. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=302.18s)]
*  But he started to say the right things. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=304.8s)]
*  It's organizing a bit of a more inclusive government. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=306.42s)]
*  And he's promising things like kicking the Iranians out of Syria, ensuring that Syria [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=309.08s)]
*  not become a terrorist safe haven again. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=313.42s)]
*  And for a lot of us, the dire economic conditions inside Syria now where Damascus only has an [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=316.62s)]
*  hour or two of electricity, 90 percent of Syrians were living below the poverty line, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=322.5s)]
*  it was critical that these sanctions be lifted. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=327.38s)]
*  And so President Trump, you know, might have kind of blundered into doing the right things, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=329.53999999999996s)]
*  perhaps for the wrong reasons, a transactional relationship with the Gulf states. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=333.58s)]
*  But this is a really good moment. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=338.02s)]
*  From the counterterrorism perspective, you know, you never want Syria to fall into kind [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=339.9s)]
*  of a failed state. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=343.58s)]
*  That would be a breeding ground for terrorism. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=345.14s)]
*  So I think the idea of reconstruction of aid, humanitarian assistance coming in is [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=346.74s)]
*  really the right policy call. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=352.3s)]
*  And Michael, also in Doha today, U.S. and Israeli officials restarted talks for the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=358.54s)]
*  Of course, President Trump not expected to take part directly, but of course, his special [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=362.1s)]
*  envoy Steve Witkoff is. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=366.02s)]
*  You know, Trump used to have harsh words for Qatar, but the country has played a key role [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=367.82s)]
*  as a mediator in previous rounds of negotiations. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=373.74s)]
*  Part of what your colleague Michael Shear wrote today has been a successful charm offensive. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=377.41999999999996s)]
*  How can Qatar be helpful to the U.S.? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=384.06s)]
*  Well, Qatar is such a complicated case. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=388.82s)]
*  And you know, President Trump's evolution is interesting because he came in saying these [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=391.14s)]
*  are bad guys, they're funders of terrorism. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=395.32s)]
*  And I think a lot of people take a superficial look. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=397.97999999999996s)]
*  I'm not here to be an apologist for Qatar, but they see that Qatar has sympathies or [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=400.66s)]
*  connections to groups that are considered terrorists by the United States. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=405.46s)]
*  But then when you actually have to start running American foreign policy and you get deeper [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=409.48s)]
*  into the way the region works, you realize that you want intermediaries with groups like [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=413.26s)]
*  Hamas, for instance. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=417.94s)]
*  And Qatar has been brokering talks to try to end the war in Gaza and release hostages. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=420.04s)]
*  And officials who have been working on this for a long time say they're fundamental, they're [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=428.46000000000004s)]
*  indispensable to getting this done. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=433.1s)]
*  It was the same thing with the Taliban, that they're very useful to have as intermediaries. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=434.70000000000005s)]
*  And you might not like some things they do, you might not like some of their alliances [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=440.58000000000004s)]
*  or their worldview, but they are really useful to have. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=445.34000000000003s)]
*  And so it's not black and white. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=449.46000000000004s)]
*  And you can't, many diplomats say, you can't just say, Qatar are the bad guys and we're [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=450.78000000000003s)]
*  not going to talk to them. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=455.66s)]
*  And I think President Trump has learned that over his time, you know, as managing foreign [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=456.78000000000003s)]
*  policy. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=462.06s)]
*  Plus, he loves wealthy monarchs and who give him fighter jet escorts and big business deals. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=463.06s)]
*  So there's that too. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=468.44s)]
*  And not to mention, Courtney Kube joins us now, a big jet, 747, that he wants to convert [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=469.98s)]
*  into Air Force One. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=476.88s)]
*  Obviously, there's been a lot of controversy about this on the Hill and elsewhere. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=479.06s)]
*  And you have some new reporting about when a gift actually may cost you more than the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=484.58s)]
*  gift itself. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=489.26s)]
*  Talk about that. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=490.26s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, that's right. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=491.26s)]
*  According to a number of aviation experts and industry officials who we spoke with, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=494.9s)]
*  this jet worth over $400 million right now, remember, it's about 13 years old. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=499.18s)]
*  Well, to refurbish it and retrofit it and make it actually ready to be an Air Force [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=503.38s)]
*  One would cost at least a billion dollars. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=508.5s)]
*  And some of the officials we spoke with said it would be more than a billion dollars. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=511.68s)]
*  It could take as long as a couple of years, two years or so. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=514.88s)]
*  So the reason for this really exorbitant cost of just essentially refinishing this plane [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=518.52s)]
*  are all the reasons that we've been hearing this week about security concerns. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=524.44s)]
*  That is, they need to essentially take the thing apart, literally almost down to bolt [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=528.48s)]
*  by bolt and make sure there's no security concerns in it, no listening devices, nothing [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  that could compromise the operations that are necessary for an Air Force One aircraft. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=537.48s)]
*  Now, that includes very secure communications. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=542.96s)]
*  The president needs to be able to have nuclear command and control at all times, including [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=545.16s)]
*  while flying on this aircraft. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=549.88s)]
*  It's beyond just encrypting those communications. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=552.36s)]
*  But beyond that, it has to be built with these additional air defenses. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=555.28s)]
*  So things like being able to repulse an electromagnetic attack or be able to defend against a potential [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=560.04s)]
*  incoming missiles, things like flares. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=566.28s)]
*  All of that takes time. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=569.04s)]
*  And in addition to that, Chris, according to the reporting way by a number of our colleagues [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=570.48s)]
*  and myself, it also needs to have individuals, engineers, people who are working on this [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=573.68s)]
*  aircraft who have the highest level security clearance. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=578.76s)]
*  That's called a Yankee White. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=581.4s)]
*  It's higher than top secret. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=582.8s)]
*  And that is because some of the systems and the programs and the capabilities of this [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=584.5s)]
*  aircraft are very secret, very top secret. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=587.62s)]
*  And that in and of itself is an effort. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=590.9s)]
*  So we're talking about a lot of money and a lot of time before this would even be able [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=593.0s)]
*  to operate as an Air Force One, Chris. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=596.68s)]
*  So Mark, this extends the conversation, whether it's the relationship, this new relationship [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=599.22s)]
*  with Qatar or obviously the gift of the plane. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=603.98s)]
*  A lot of folks have had a lot to say on Capitol Hill. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=607.96s)]
*  None more colorfully, as is often the case, than Senator Kennedy. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=610.32s)]
*  Let me play that for you. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=615.18s)]
*  I trust Qatar like I trust a rest stop bathroom. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=618.6s)]
*  If they want to be friendly, I want to be friendly back. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=624.0s)]
*  But with those guys, you know, trust in God, but tie up your camel. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  Tie up your camel or as the old adage is, trust but verify. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  But the question is, what does verification look like in this new world? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  Is it security or is it business deals? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=643.14s)]
*  Well, first of all, I have kind of flashbacks of the New Jersey turnpike and rest stops [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=646.6800000000001s)]
*  there. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=650.6800000000001s)]
*  So that's a pretty colorful statement. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  But the security concerns in this are so grave that, you know, it would be hard pressed not [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=655.08s)]
*  to think that somehow someone quietly is going to tell President Trump, whether it's Pete [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=660.88s)]
*  Hegs, the Secretary of Defense, after all, this airplane will belong to the Air Force, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=664.2800000000001s)]
*  or the Director of National Intelligence, the CIA Director, FBI Director, Secret Service [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=668.6s)]
*  Director. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=673.24s)]
*  There's really no way they can go forward with this unless Trump just waives all those [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=674.24s)]
*  security requirements. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=678.76s)]
*  And Chris, I think that's what you're talking about now. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=679.76s)]
*  You know, perhaps this transactional, you know, nature of Trump's policy is going to [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=682.32s)]
*  be such that he just accepts this. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=687.48s)]
*  The Trump administration has not been great on security. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=689.64s)]
*  We just got over the whole signal gate issue. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=691.64s)]
*  And so Trump could waive all the security requirements. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=693.92s)]
*  It would not be safe. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=696.6s)]
*  It's not safe for him, for the American people. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=697.6s)]
*  But this is such an unorthodox president. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=700.08s)]
*  And of course, by the way, the plane is sitting in San Antonio, Texas, and he's seen it already. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=702.04s)]
*  So perhaps this is going a little bit further down the line. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=705.56s)]
*  But I would expect the national security team to talk to him quietly. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFer0lPtsck&t=708.16s)]
