# Trump family ‘must be held accountable’ for meme coin ‘scandal’: Rep. Garcia
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA)
*  New reaction today from Elon Musk about his tenure in the Trump administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=0.0s)]
*  after the president gave him a formal send-off Friday from his role as a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  special government employee. In an interview with CBS he talked about [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=8.34s)]
*  attacks on Doge. It's a bit unfair because like Doge became the whooping boy for [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=12.3s)]
*  everything so if there was some cut real or imagined everyone would blame Doge. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=19.04s)]
*  I've had people think that like somehow Doge is gonna stop them from getting [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=23.32s)]
*  their Social Security check which is completely untrue but a my frank opinion [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=27.24s)]
*  of the government is that like the government is just like the DMV that got [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=31.4s)]
*  big okay so like when you say it like let's have the government do something [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=37.56s)]
*  you should think do you want the DMV to do it. Joining me now is California [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=42.2s)]
*  Congressman Robert Garcia he's on the oversight transportation and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  infrastructure as well as Homeland Security committees and a good friend to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=50.959999999999994s)]
*  us. I'm curious your reaction there because it seemed like Elon Musk and he's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=54.04s)]
*  kind of like oh man don't don't hit on Doge. Yeah easy easy for him to say I [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=57.96s)]
*  mean this is the richest person on the planet spent more money than anybody [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=64.76s)]
*  else to elect Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress. He along with [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=68.08s)]
*  Donald Trump spent months now slashing federal agencies destroying programs [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=73.4s)]
*  destroying our reputation around the world causing massive pain and heartache [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=79.28s)]
*  to our federal employees and people that are dependent on of course services from [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=84.36s)]
*  us and now he just wants to walk away like nothing happened. At the same [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=88.68s)]
*  time he's gained access to personal information he's impacted investigations [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=92.8s)]
*  against his companies and he continues to stand next to Donald Trump so this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=96.72s)]
*  idea that somehow he's stepping away or stepping back I don't think anybody [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=101.08s)]
*  should believe that for a minute. Clearly he understands he's damaged his own [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=104.64s)]
*  brands like like Tesla and others clearly that's the case but at the same [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=109.16s)]
*  time he's hurt our government and the American public and he must be held [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=113.32s)]
*  accountable for that. So look he wasn't even close to hitting his target of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=117.36s)]
*  slashing what was it true two trillion I think he said in federal spending at the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=121.16s)]
*  outset Doge cut about 150 billion. Excerpts believe in fact the real [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=124.44s)]
*  number is even lower. The Partnership for Public Service estimates that Doge's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=128.64s)]
*  layoffs of federal workers will cost 135 billion this year so you don't think the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=132.74s)]
*  people is going to cease with his departure right? Now I don't I mean first [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=138.68s)]
*  I mean Donald Trump runs a chaotic White House anyways but let's be clear what [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=143.84s)]
*  what Donald Trump and Elon Musk have done through Doge and the thing [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=147.84s)]
*  that's hurt the agencies in our government the most is laying off [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  talented people across our government inter agencies. Folks that essentially [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=154.4s)]
*  we've lost basically decades and decades of work of just their intellect their [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=159.0s)]
*  commitment to to the community their commitment to the country that is now [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=164.8s)]
*  gone we just can't replace people overnight you can't just bring in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=168.2s)]
*  someone with that level of experience into the federal government and so we [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  we have really lost a critical part of our government workforce they wanted to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  damage the government and they've done that but but it's really important if [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=179.56s)]
*  Elon Musk walks away with God knows what private information of the American [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  publics he has to be held accountable for what he has done. He must testify in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=188.04s)]
*  front of Congress we must be able to ask questions about his companies. Why are [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  all the investigations across multiple agencies against his companies now [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=197.32s)]
*  dropped? What insider information does he have that could benefit his companies [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=201.44s)]
*  in federal contracts in the future? These are all real questions that must be [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=204.96s)]
*  asked and so we shouldn't take his word for it when he says he's gonna step away [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=209.68s)]
*  from government. And maybe they can be asked that is if the Democrats take over [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=213.4s)]
*  the House in the midterms next year but let's talk about this week with Jamie [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=217.16s)]
*  Raskin of course the top dem on the House Judiciary Committee who opened an [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=220.88s)]
*  investigation into the private dinner who wants to rather calling for it into [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=224.72s)]
*  the private dinner that the president held for the 220 top holders of the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=228.2s)]
*  Trump meme coin. Ethics experts as you know they call Trump's crypto ventures [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=231.6s)]
*  the starkest example to date of seeking to profit off the presidency. Do you [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=236.24s)]
*  support these investigations even though congressional Democrats lack the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=240.84s)]
*  authority to hold the president accountable in any meaningful way? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=244.68s)]
*  Completely support these investigations. Jamie Raskin is the right person to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=248.52s)]
*  help lead those and let's be really clear this meme coin scandal is the most [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=253.12s)]
*  corrupting a president has done I mean in the modern era. I mean essentially [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=259.6s)]
*  he's created a piggy bank some a base essentially opportunity for people [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=262.8s)]
*  across the world which we don't know who are basically dumping in money for his [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=267.28s)]
*  own personal use. People are just putting in all of this wealth essentially for [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=272.2s)]
*  the Trump family with no types of guardrails for us no type of transparency [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=278.28s)]
*  for the American public and when you talk about the meme coin when you talk [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  about all of these foreign real estate deals with the Trump company across the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  world while he's doing the American business and diplomacy with these [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  companies while you talk about the foreign plane 400 million dollar plane [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  that is asking for this is just this administration he hasn't even been held [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=299.4s)]
*  accountable for the corruption the first time. Jared Kushner walking away [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=304.24s)]
*  with a two billion dollar foreign investment fund for doing absolutely [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=308.32s)]
*  nothing and so all of these issues continue to pile up and the Trump family [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  must be held accountable for this major corruption. A new report in Wired reveals [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=317.24s)]
*  that the administration has collected DNA samples of over a hundred and thirty [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=323.24s)]
*  three thousand migrant children and teenagers and then uploaded their [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=326.72s)]
*  genetic data into a national criminal database used by state and federal law [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=331.12s)]
*  enforcement so the DOJ argues that DNA collection at the border provides an [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=335.8s)]
*  assessment of the danger a migrant potentially poses to the public and will [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=340.72s)]
*  help solve future crimes they may commit. Here's the Homeland Security Director [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  today. We are focusing on dangerous criminals we are going out there and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=349.52s)]
*  ensuring the people that repeatedly break our laws are being held [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=355.44s)]
*  accountable and I would say and remind everybody that Congress directs what our [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=358.36s)]
*  laws are they can change our programs they can raise visa programs and guest [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=362.6s)]
*  worker programs they can make it easier for us we have suggestions and I'm using [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  all the authority that I have to meet our workforce needs but also we need to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=372.6s)]
*  make sure that our communities are safer again. Can you give me a quick sense of what [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=376.88s)]
*  you make of Nome saying the administration's focusing on deportations [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=381.76s)]
*  and dangerous criminals? I mean Kristi Nome is clearly a liar what she's doing [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=384.96s)]
*  is she is eliminating due process for folks in this country for US citizens [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=390.88s)]
*  we've had US citizen children deported without due process we have people that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=395.44s)]
*  are coming to this country with an asylum appointment that are being [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=400.24s)]
*  denied due process due process is a cornerstone of our Constitution and our [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=403.24s)]
*  country and Kristi Nome has actually no interest in a safe legal immigration [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  system in this country she wants to deport whoever she can find even if [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  they're US citizens in some cases and she decides who she deems as a criminal [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=417.04s)]
*  or who has broken the law not the courts and that is a dangerous moment to be in [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=422.24s)]
*  this country has always been one of laws where judges juries courtrooms decide [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=426.72s)]
*  when someone is committed a crime when someone can actually go through the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=432.52s)]
*  immigration process and now we have Kristi Nome making up her own rules as [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=435.68s)]
*  she goes incredibly concerned to see these databases being being grown and [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=439.52s)]
*  particularly looking at children and I tell people that we're all next US [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=444.2s)]
*  citizens are next they're going to continue to do this and then they're [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=449.0s)]
*  going to want to collect information from US citizens and we're US citizens [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=451.88s)]
*  are already being deported being snatched up this is incredibly concerning [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=455.35999999999996s)]
*  everybody should oppose what Kristi Nome is trying to do okay Congressman Robert [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=459.64s)]
*  Garcia we'll see you again soon thank you much [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6R5B1HVvA&t=463.47999999999996s)]
