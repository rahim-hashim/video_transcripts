# 'We are not a city of criminals': LA Mayor Bass blasts Trump admin's response to protests
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI)
*  And now joining us is Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass. Mayor Bass, thanks so much for taking the time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump says that if he didn't send in the troops, your city would be burning to the ground right now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=5.36s)]
*  His words. There were arrests for violence, like throwing a Molotov cocktail at police officers. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=11.4s)]
*  Did LA authorities have the situation under control? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=16.6s)]
*  Yes. And I will tell you something. He sent out a message Saturday night saying that the reason why the protests [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=19.8s)]
*  and the vandalism was quelled was because of the brilliant work of the National Guard. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=28.56s)]
*  The National Guard was not even in Los Angeles. They had not even been deployed at that time. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=33.76s)]
*  As your guests previously said, and I so appreciated their comments, the National Guard has one mission, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  and that is to protect a building. And that has nothing to do with the protests that you're seeing in the streets. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=46.4s)]
*  So that's 100 soldiers. What are another 1000 going to do protecting one building? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=53.64s)]
*  And then he's going to send in the Marines to do what? I don't know what these people are going to do, as your previous guests said. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=61.44s)]
*  These are several isolated streets in downtown Los Angeles. It is not even all of downtown Los Angeles. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=68.8s)]
*  Painting this like this is 1992 all over again when it was citywide civil unrest has nothing to do with the situation that you're looking at now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=76.8s)]
*  And frankly, it's just provocative. It was almost as though the administration wanted to see chaos in this city. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  I appealed and said, please do not do this because all it's going to do is agitate people. And that's exactly what you're saying. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=95.36s)]
*  You mentioned that you mentioned the 1992 situation that was after the Rodney King verdict and we saw those riots in the streets. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=103.0s)]
*  But you've you have accused the administration of using your city as a test case for taking over local control. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=110.08s)]
*  So far, it appears these troops are only guarding federal buildings. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  Do you see the administration already encroaching on your authority? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=119.16s)]
*  No, no, no. What I was referring to is they took over the authority from the governor for the National Guard. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  And so federalizing troops when the troops were not requested, I didn't make a request. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=131.24s)]
*  The chief of police or the sheriff, the sheriff is the one who officially makes the request. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=137.84s)]
*  No one asked for help. Yes, there was violence. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=142.44s)]
*  Yes, there was vandalism. But we have a law enforcement community here beyond Los Angeles Police Department. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  We have sheriffs. We have 88 cities in the county of Los Angeles. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=153.08s)]
*  So mutual aid from any of those departments could have happened. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=157.28s)]
*  And when they were needed, it did happen. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  Few days later, the chief did ask for mutual aid. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=164.16s)]
*  But we did not need national troops. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=168.44s)]
*  I want to play what Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said about you and your city this weekend. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  I served with her in Congress before she was ever mayor. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=180.52s)]
*  And she is a train wreck of a mayor now that is endorsing these kind of activities, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=184.24s)]
*  has allowed her city to be completely devastated with crime. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=188.28s)]
*  And now she's holding press conferences talking about the fact that people have the right to peacefully protest and that they're a city of immigrants. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=192.56s)]
*  Well, they're not a city of immigrants. They're a city of criminals. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=199.8s)]
*  Mayor, what's your response? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=204.12s)]
*  Well, you know, sometimes when such outlandish statements are made, they're just the beneath the dignity of her office. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=206.28s)]
*  And what she is saying is absolutely ridiculous. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=213.6s)]
*  We are not a city of criminals. We are a city where crime has gone down significantly. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=216.88s)]
*  Does crime still take place? Of course. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  We have a number of issues here and we have been resolving them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  But the idea that we are a city of criminals is just very unfortunate. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=228.84s)]
*  Meantime, more federal forces are arriving. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  But here's what President Trump said all the way back in 2020. Listen. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  Look, we have laws. We have to go by the laws. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=241.8s)]
*  We can't move in the National Guard. I can call insurrection, but there's no reason to ever do that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  Even in a Portland case, we can't call in the National Guard unless we're requested by a governor. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=251.96s)]
*  Again, that was his stance in 2020. So what's changed? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=257.56s)]
*  Well, I don't think anything has changed. I think, well, maybe this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=262.76s)]
*  Maybe he has he does not have the individuals in the White House who tried to tell him to put on the breaks. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=266.76s)]
*  Maybe that's what has changed. But I don't know. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=273.24s)]
*  What I do know is what is happening in Los Angeles. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=275.64s)]
*  And until the raids stop, I am going to be concerned about fear and tension in the city. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=278.2s)]
*  People going to work and not knowing whether or not they're going to be able to get home that evening. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=285.64s)]
*  We have people who are showing up who are in the country legally showing up to the immigration office for their annual appointments, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  maybe sometimes even bringing their families and then getting detained. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  So the raids do not help our city. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=303.32s)]
*  We are a city of immigrants and there are sectors of the workforce that are dominated by immigrant labor. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=306.59999999999997s)]
*  And so the economy of our city does not need this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  We are 12 months away from the World Cup and we're trying to bring our city together to beautify our city. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=317.0s)]
*  And look at what has happened now. The White House instigated this by having ICE raids in our city. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=323.16s)]
*  They are telling us that they're going to have raids for the next 30 days. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=329.88s)]
*  So, you know, and that has a whole sector of the population on pins and needles. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=333.48s)]
*  You were talking about someone doing child care, a nanny in an individual's home or your landscaper, your gardener, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=338.36s)]
*  you know, people who are small business owners, people who contribute to our economy in multiple ways. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=345.56s)]
*  And so to disrupt that hurts the economy of Los Angeles and is the opposite of what we need to be doing to prepare for the World Cup. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=351.64s)]
*  We were told there were, in fact, five more immigration raids just yesterday alone in the Los Angeles County area. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=359.88s)]
*  Border czar Tom Homan says anyone, including you, could be arrested if you cross the line and impede law enforcement or knowingly harbor undocumented immigrants. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=366.36s)]
*  Are you concerned that you could be arrested? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=374.35999999999996s)]
*  No, I'm not concerned that I could be arrested. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=377.23999999999995s)]
*  And that's just an unbelievably irresponsible statement for somebody to make who I was on the phone with an hour before the statement was made. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=379.47999999999996s)]
*  So he is referencing if I were to intervene, maybe hit a federal officer or something. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=388.76s)]
*  It's just ridiculous. It's like the other comment that was made. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=395.08s)]
*  Do you spend your time, you know, responding to comments that that really rob dignity out of the offices that they serve in? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=398.76s)]
*  If you've been on the phone with Homan or other administration officials, what is the level of coordination at this point? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=407.56s)]
*  Well, there's not coordination. I mean, I had one conversation with him. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=413.96s)]
*  And again, I was trying to explain to him why we did not need federal troops in Los Angeles. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=417.4s)]
*  And obviously, my conversation didn't go anywhere. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=422.84s)]
*  What do local business owners need to know if ICE shows up at their workplace? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=426.12s)]
*  Well, you know, I think it's very important for people to know their rights. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=432.52s)]
*  And when you're talking about business owners, they could be undocumented as well, as well as their employees. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=436.2s)]
*  But you don't have to cooperate. You can, you know, remain silent. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=442.91999999999996s)]
*  There's a know your rights series of things that individuals can do and business owners. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=449.0s)]
*  But, you know, you've seen pictures of people around the country. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=455.0s)]
*  I saw a woman in a car, man in a car, and he was waiting for his attorneys. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=458.2s)]
*  And ICE just broke the windows of his car and dragged him out. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=463.72s)]
*  Now, we've not seen anything like that here in Los Angeles. I certainly hope that we do not. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=467.0s)]
*  But what is normal practice? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=472.2s)]
*  Like, if you are detained, you're allowed to see your attorney who is representing you for your family to know where you are. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=474.28s)]
*  This is not happening in this case. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=481.96s)]
*  Mayor, before I let you go, I mean, there is the immigration raids, which, of course, kicked off the unrest and the upheaval. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=484.36s)]
*  People want to resist what is happening to their friends and their neighbors and other members of the community who are contributing in their community. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=490.68s)]
*  And then there's the issue of the National Guard troops moving in, the Marines being deployed. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=499.64000000000004s)]
*  What do you see as the stakes in this moment? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=505.16s)]
*  Well, the stakes in this moment is, number one, our preparation for next year. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=508.68s)]
*  It's not just the fear that's coming. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=513.72s)]
*  It's the swelling, the fear and the terror that goes through families, people not sure they should go to work, kids not sure they should go to school. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=515.72s)]
*  It's the sense of uncertainty and fear that is rampant in the city right now. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=525.24s)]
*  And so to me, what I say to Angelino's is that we absolutely have to stand together in a time like this. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=532.28s)]
*  We do not want to allow anyone to divide us. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=539.0s)]
*  And I, as mayor, am going to do everything I can to keep Angelino safe, regardless of why they came here, when they came here or how. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=542.68s)]
*  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, thank you again for your time. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scr6XCok6dI&t=572.68s)]
