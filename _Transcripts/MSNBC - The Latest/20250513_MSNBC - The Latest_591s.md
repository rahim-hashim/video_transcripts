# 'Taking, taking, taking and not giving back': Dem strategist on GOP's Medicaid cuts
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4)
*  Let's go to the Hill and NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Melanie Zanona also with us is former Republican governor of Ohio John Kasich and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=0.0s)]
*  Professor at Columbia University and Democratic strategist Basil Smykle both our MSNBC political analysts Melanie [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=8.22s)]
*  We just heard from the Democratic leader, but our Republicans there on Capitol Hill feeling the same [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=15.22s)]
*  for the most part Republicans are ducking and dodging or in some cases even [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=21.62s)]
*  Defending Donald Trump the line we've heard most from Republicans is that there can't be anything fishy or suspicious about this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=26.24s)]
*  Because both sides are being upfront about the arrangement [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=31.84s)]
*  But it's very clear that there are some Republicans who are at least a little uncomfortable and a little queasy about this whole thing [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=35.08s)]
*  But instead of criticizing Trump or saying he shouldn't accept the plane instead [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=41.92s)]
*  They're talking about how we already have a plane. Of course, that is Air Force one [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=45.7s)]
*  Just take a listen to these mixed responses from Republicans [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  Are you concerned about this just on its face the idea of accepting the plane in this way from the Qajari? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=51.18s)]
*  Well, it's pretty transparent. So it's not like it's going underneath the radar here [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=58.68s)]
*  Now is it I have a lot of thoughts on it. What do you know answer your questions specifically? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=62.64s)]
*  I'd have to defer to ethics people on that point [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=67.6s)]
*  But I know this I've written on Air Force one and there's plenty quality there for the next 50 years [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=71.64s)]
*  Now there is at least one exception in the GOP that is Republican Senator Rand Paul [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=78.22s)]
*  He says he thinks it's a bad idea or a mistake for Trump to accept this plane [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=82.41999999999999s)]
*  But so far few other Republicans echoing those two concerns right now [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=86.25999999999999s)]
*  Governor Kasich, we know Senator Rand Paul is calling this a mistake and saying that the plane as a gift sends the wrong signal [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=90.33999999999999s)]
*  How do you view it? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=99.41999999999999s)]
*  Well, when I was governor, you know, I had to get off of everything [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=101.69999999999999s)]
*  I mean I was on a board of just [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=104.72s)]
*  Of a place where I hung out it was of no significance whatsoever [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  Look, I hope when I got done being governor, maybe I give me a bicycle [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=113.68s)]
*  Hey when I heard about this, I just sort of chuckled and laughed [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=118.68s)]
*  But look the reason why you don't take things is because you get influenced [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=121.92s)]
*  You know, it's just doesn't make any sense to me that I mean, it's just so [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=127.44s)]
*  On a frankly, I mean could I don't know how you even make this stuff up? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=132.66s)]
*  It's so ridiculous and do I think he should take the plane? No, I don't know what the Qataris are trying to do [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=136.66s)]
*  but when I was in office always operated with a [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=142.46s)]
*  Little being a little bit paranoid that I need to make sure that I don't cross any lines that I don't get into bad [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=145.62s)]
*  Conflicts that I'm I'm not in a situation where you know people are going to start questioning my ethics [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=151.82s)]
*  So that's the way that I operated and I think it's the right way to operate you don't get into trouble and yet [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=158.28s)]
*  We're not talking here about you know [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=164.76s)]
*  Some minor thing we're talking about a jumbo jet, right? Yes [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=166.96s)]
*  47 as a gift what they're calling a floating palace that's worth billions of dollars [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=172.32s)]
*  At a time by the way when American people are saying I'm having a hard time paying for groceries [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=178.2s)]
*  The optics of that sends another signal but Basil we know we know Democrats on the hill are calling for an ethics investigation [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=183.94s)]
*  I just wondered do they have power to do that? And is there anything else they can do? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=191.1s)]
*  well what senator Schumer said earlier with with holding up the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=196.9s)]
*  The Justice Department nominees, I think is is an important first step and it's important also because Pam Bondi herself [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=200.7s)]
*  Was a lobbyist for the government of Qatar [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=208.64s)]
*  $115,000 a month for almost two years. Are you kidding me? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=212.83999999999997s)]
*  There are tremendous at potential ethics violations and conflicts of interest involved and I always think about this because I always try to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  Sort of think if situations were reversed imagine if Barack Obama [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=223.48s)]
*  Got a tricked out airplane from another country [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=228.0s)]
*  I could only imagine the memes the horrible means some of them are probably funny [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=230.92s)]
*  But some really horrible means that would have been all over the internet [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=235.42s)]
*  I have to think the Republicans would have been saying something different than what we played [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=239.78s)]
*  different, I mean it would be it would be [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=244.54s)]
*  Horrendous, so you know the governor's right [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=247.66s)]
*  Anybody that's ever been in government should understand that you have to act with a little bit of paranoia [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=250.66s)]
*  I was in every level of government if I had a dinner over a certain amount of money [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=254.94s)]
*  I had to report that so a 400 million dollar plane which is probably worth a lot more [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=260.74s)]
*  Is is a violation of at many other levels? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=264.84s)]
*  We're looking at these live images as we expect the president any moment there in Saudi Arabia to address this economic forum [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=268.92s)]
*  So we'll keep an eye on that in the meantime Melanie [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=275.36s)]
*  There's a lot happening on the hill as it relates to the budget and I want to ask you about the Medicaid fight brewing there [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=278.24s)]
*  Two key house committees that oversee the program are set to meet this afternoon to discuss potential cuts. What's the latest? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, this has been one of the biggest sticking points in this debate over Trump's big [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=292.26s)]
*  domestic policy bill and at issue here is that conservative heartliners have been calling for [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=296.73999999999995s)]
*  Massive cuts to Medicaid in order to pay for their tax priorities [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=302.18s)]
*  Whereas moderate Republicans have warned against making any cuts to Medicaid and so the final product that is getting a committee vote later today [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=305.62s)]
*  Attempts to essentially strike a balance between those two camps [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=312.85999999999996s)]
*  It does not include some of the steepest potential cuts to Medicaid like reducing the federal match rate [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=316.29999999999995s)]
*  But it does include some pretty significant changes such as instituting work requirements something that is not currently in place for able-bodied adults [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=321.3s)]
*  Who don't have dependents? There's also going to be more frequent eligibility checks [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=328.88s)]
*  And there's also gonna be a crackdown on non-citizens who are on the Medicaid role [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=332.72s)]
*  So this is gonna be a big showdown later today. It could result in millions of Americans losing their Medicaid coverage so far [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=336.88s)]
*  We're hearing they're gonna have the votes in committee [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  The bigger question is what happens on the floor potentially next week on a governor roughly nine [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  Million Americans could be impacted by Medicaid cuts this issue. We know has divided [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=350.70000000000005s)]
*  Republicans GOP Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri calling it quote morally wrong and politically suicidal [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=356.22s)]
*  What do you make of those remarks? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=363.26s)]
*  When I became governor because I actually had a handle Medicaid [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=365.62s)]
*  I don't talk about the old days [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=368.90000000000003s)]
*  But I have to point out some facts when I came in Medicaid was growing at about nine percent [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=370.14000000000004s)]
*  Okay [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=375.76s)]
*  Was it was a high rate of growth I expanded Medicaid and put six hundred thousand more people on the rolls [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=376.72s)]
*  But my Medicaid program was actually growing at about four and a half percent. It's now growing [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=383.08000000000004s)]
*  My understanding is over ten percent. Well, how did we do that? Because we've reformed the program [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=388.8s)]
*  We made sure that we took care of people who were the most vulnerable [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=394.36s)]
*  But we also were able to make tough decisions how much money we are paying providers [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=398.44s)]
*  You know, can we have a system that stresses quality? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=404.28s)]
*  There's many ways to reform this program where you can stop the significant growth in the program and yet still protect the vulnerable [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=407.36s)]
*  But that requires tough decision-making it requires character. It requires leadership [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=415.76s)]
*  I believe that it can be done, but you have to do it. You have to do it carefully in addition to that [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=420.24s)]
*  Look, I think that the whole healthcare system whether it's Medicaid Medicare [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=426.88s)]
*  Any of the costs that we have if I were at charge if I were the president I would gather all the doctors all the hospitals [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=431.38000000000005s)]
*  the pharmaceutical companies the insurance companies and look at health care and have a system that rewards keeping people healthy [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=438.34000000000003s)]
*  Not giving them rewards for treating people to keep giving them tests when they're sick. This is a big idea [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=445.54s)]
*  It's something that should be done because our health care system can be more effective can be more efficient can be more transparent [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=451.62s)]
*  All that can happen and so that's what I have to say [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=458.28000000000003s)]
*  I think people in both parties can agree with all of that [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  You just said in terms of what is needed to improve the health care system Basil [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=465.12s)]
*  We've seen this this dance before where Republicans propose health care cuts Democrats campaign against it seems to work out in their favor [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=470.24s)]
*  I'm wondering this time around, you know, it seems that Democratic voters are saying yeah do something more [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=477.76000000000005s)]
*  What can Democrats do? Where does the party go from here? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=483.6s)]
*  Well, I think calling out exactly the some of the challenges with these cuts and what it will do for the average [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=486.52s)]
*  For the average American you also tie that to the fact that you're cutting you're cutting [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=493.18s)]
*  Significant parts of the social safety net on the one hand and prices are going up on the other particularly with these tariffs [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=498.74s)]
*  So if you're in a rural community of an ex-urban community, and if you're a small business [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=503.82s)]
*  You know all of these things are going to affect your bottom line and costs for the average American are going to go up [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=507.65999999999997s)]
*  But by the way, we're also cutting your health care at the same time [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=513.06s)]
*  So I think using a lot of that language in addition to the fact that [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=515.86s)]
*  And this is going to Josh Hawley's op-ed [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=521.08s)]
*  You've got Republicans in blue states in tight districts that are going to be [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=524.0s)]
*  Significantly impacted by this especially a state like New York by the way, that's salt tax [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=530.2s)]
*  You're right. The Republicans was supposed to bring that back didn't happen. So or the or the reimbursement [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=535.0s)]
*  So you know what? There are a lot of ways in which Democrats can talk about how [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=541.1800000000001s)]
*  Republicans cons are taking taking taking and not giving back [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=546.7s)]
*  That's not what so-called Republican values have been [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=550.2s)]
*  But Democrats can be restorative in that regard and try to put more money back in the pockets of Americans [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=553.22s)]
*  I know on the salt tax issue. That's a battle. That's still brewing is not completely a done deal yet [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=559.0600000000001s)]
*  We'll have more to say on the tax front another day. Thank you so much [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=564.16s)]
*  Melanie's anona John Kasich and Basil Smigel [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=568.0600000000001s)]
*  You [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUu5RopNSh4&t=575.86s)]
