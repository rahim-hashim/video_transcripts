# President is having ‘a lot more fun’ in his second term: Atlantic reporter on Trump interview
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ)
*  And joining us now is the Atlantic's Ashley Parker, who sat down with the president inside the Oval Office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Ashley, the big line from your interview was the president comparing this term to his first term. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=6.16s)]
*  He told you, quote, The first time I had to do things to run the country and survive. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  And the second time I run the country and the world. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Is that the view throughout the White House? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=20.0s)]
*  Is this a common sentiment when you talk to folks at 1600 Penn? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=21.76s)]
*  So the comment, yes, the common sentiment more, though, even than that, although I think the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=25.04s)]
*  president, frankly, is correct and people can make their own judgment of whether that is a good or a [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=32.32s)]
*  bad thing. That statement is something of a Rorschach test. Some people like the idea that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=37.68s)]
*  he is bending the country and the world to his will. Some people don't. But the through line, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=41.68s)]
*  really, in everyone we talked to when we put this question to the president is that Donald Trump is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  having a lot more fun this time than he was having the first time. Someone told us the first time he [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=51.6s)]
*  got there and he wanted to blow things up. This time, he's blowing more things up and he's doing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=56.72s)]
*  it with a twinkle in his eye. Well, on that note, I mean, he is generally a no regrets kind of guy, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  but we have seen him temper himself on a couple of things. He looks like he might be softening [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=68.56s)]
*  on how he feels about Vladimir Putin. He put a pause on these tariffs after he got reaction [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=73.36s)]
*  from the market and some CEOs. Did you get any sense from President Trump that he wished he'd [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=78.08s)]
*  handle some things differently during his first hundred days or is he proud of his record so far? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=82.8s)]
*  Not that he wished he had handled things differently, but we did put actually both [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=88.48s)]
*  of those questions to him. We asked him, you know, is there anything Russia could possibly do [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=92.16s)]
*  that would make you side with Ukraine, essentially? And his answer was revealing. He said, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=98.4s)]
*  Ukraine, yes, President Zelensky, no. So it's clear that he just views President Zelensky as [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=105.44s)]
*  sort of a foe. He's never going to be able to get behind, but there was sort of this little opening [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=112.48s)]
*  for sympathy potentially for the Ukrainians. And we also put the tariffs question to him, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=119.44s)]
*  not if he regretted what he had done, but there's this theory on Wall Street of a quote, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  unquote, Trump put this idea that there is a red line where things get so bad, whether it's the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=130.96s)]
*  threat of a recession or the devaluation of the dollar or, you know, big box stores, the shelves [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=136.4s)]
*  being barren and what's on the shelves being incredibly expensive. If there's any red line [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=142.72s)]
*  that would force him to rethink his tariff policy and what he told us, and Wall Street believes he [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  would, and that's obviously very reassuring to them and reassuring to the markets. What he told [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=153.28s)]
*  us was no, you know, I'm aware of these things, but he told us there's no certain number. That said, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=157.2s)]
*  we did see him pull back actually when the bond markets went haywire. So what he says and what he [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=163.11999999999998s)]
*  may actually do when that tariff pauses up in 90 days are potentially different things. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=168.64s)]
*  Yeah. And he said he saw Jamie Dimon speaking on one of the Fox business channels and that, you [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  know, he wanted to consider his words. I also want to ask you, you know, there are polls gauging [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  Trump's approval ratings are basically kind of Trump versus Trump. But the ABC News Washington [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=182.88s)]
*  Post Ipsos poll asks, who do you trust to handle the country's main problem? 37% went for the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=187.68s)]
*  president. 30% went for congressional Dems and 30% say they don't trust either one. That last 30%, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=194.4s)]
*  what does that move mean moving forward for the country? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=201.68s)]
*  Well, one thing it makes me think of is something Senator Elissa Slotkin told us for this cover [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=205.76s)]
*  story in the Atlantic, because obviously she won in a state that Trump won. So there was a lot of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=210.56s)]
*  Trump Slotkin voters. And she said, it was interesting that segment you played from Shack of sort of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=216.24s)]
*  died in the world Trump voters. She was talking to us about what she's hearing from those sorts of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=220.72s)]
*  voters, the Trump Slotkin voters. And she said, a lot of them said to me, look, I view myself as a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=226.16s)]
*  stage four cancer patient where nothing has worked. Things have gotten worse from my grandfather to my [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=231.84s)]
*  and things I fear are going to be worse for my children still. And I'm sort of at the end of my [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=239.04s)]
*  rope and I'm willing to try any sort of experimental treatment, experimental chemo. And Trump is that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  experimental chemo. And so I think that is a lot of that third group you articulated. They didn't [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=250.0s)]
*  necessarily love him. They just didn't know what else to do. And that's going to be the interesting [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  group to watch when they see, you know, I voted for him as a desperate last ditch effort. I didn't [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=261.36s)]
*  expect him, for instance, to cut the VA. Even though chemo can make you sick, I guess it's part [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=266.64s)]
*  of that long term strategy, short term pain, long term strategy, looking for a cure. If you think [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  that that's what's else the governments are willing to sit through that and hopefully turn things [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=277.2s)]
*  around. I also want to ask you, we've confirmed now that Donald Trump called Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=281.36s)]
*  this morning to personally express his displeasure over a report that the website would put the cost [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=286.24s)]
*  of tariffs online. What does that say to you? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, first, it is just remarkable how much that relationship between President Trump and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=293.44s)]
*  Jeff Bezos has changed over time. You know, full disclosure, until recently, until January, I worked [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=300.4s)]
*  at the Washington Post, which Jeff Bezos owns. And, you know, in the first term, Jeff Bezos, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  and not just him, but a lot of these tech titans, these tech oligarchs, really wanted to keep their [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=312.56s)]
*  distance from Trump. And there was sort of a cosmic shift. Part of it was the assassination [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=317.6s)]
*  attempt. Someone described it to us as a lot of these uber wealthy men, sort of on a visceral [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=322.56s)]
*  gut level. It made Trump feel like their spirit animal. Also, all the persecutions, there was a [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  way they related. They sort of felt if people could come after Trump, people could come after them. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  But it means that Jeff Bezos has made very clear by going to the inauguration and practically [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=337.68s)]
*  perching himself on Trump's knee, by going down to Mar-a-Lago to kiss the ring, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=342.72s)]
*  that he is incredibly open to kind of desperately seeking a positive relationship with the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=348.32s)]
*  president of the United States. So it's not surprising that Trump would call him and expect [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=354.4s)]
*  Jeff Bezos to quickly bend to as well. Hence, pick up the phone. All right. It's an incredible [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=359.36s)]
*  interview. Ashley Parker, thank you so much for making time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=364.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGxRS_jaDCQ&t=372.0s)]
