# 'Completely reckless budget': Rep. Ro Khanna rips at the Big Beautiful Bill
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs)
*  Joining me now, Congressman Ro Khanna, Democrat of California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman, thanks for being with us tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=6.0s)]
*  President Trump's trade policy took another beating this week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=11.6s)]
*  Most of his tariffs were blocked by a federal judge, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=15.16s)]
*  only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=18.52s)]
*  Still, here he is announcing new tariffs just last night in Pittsburgh. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=26.56s)]
*  We are going to be imposing a 25% increase. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=34.32s)]
*  We're going to bring it from 25% to 50% the tariffs on steel into the United States of America. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=40.0s)]
*  So we're bringing it up from 25%. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  We're doubling it to 50%. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=51.4s)]
*  Congressman, this week even Wall Street, which largely cheered President Trump's second term, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=55.32s)]
*  was joining in making fun of his tendency to chicken out on his big tariff threats. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=62.32s)]
*  What do you make of this new one? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, he's just creating chaos. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=73.16s)]
*  Look, he campaigned against the napalm steel deal. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=76.16s)]
*  He said he was not going to allow Japan to buy a U.S. steel company. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=80.60000000000001s)]
*  Of course, President Biden blocked that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=85.52s)]
*  President Biden stood with the steelworkers. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=87.68s)]
*  Now Trump basically has green-lighted the napalm steel deal and has abandoned his campaign pledge. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  He is not holding them accountable to create those union jobs in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=97.76s)]
*  The steelworkers are concerned about it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=102.6s)]
*  And so he says, well, what can I throw out there? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=104.84s)]
*  I'm going to put out this 50% tariff. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  What about the sale of the steel company to Japan, which President Biden opposed [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=109.04s)]
*  and you opposed on the campaign trail and now are engaged in? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=115.04s)]
*  So there's no consistency. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=118.72s)]
*  And he's offering no funding to build these new steel plants here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  So basically, your view is that he's throwing out these tariffs to cover up for the fact [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=124.36000000000001s)]
*  that he's selling the steel plants U.S. Steel to napalm. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=130.28s)]
*  But staying with Wall Street's response to Trump's actions, analysts are warning that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=136.56s)]
*  his big, beautiful bill could have a big, ugly impact on U.S. markets by adding trillions [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  to the national debt, mostly to pay for his tax cuts. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  And it's reported that some in the finance world are worried the cost of the bill could [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=154.84s)]
*  disturb the U.S. bond market with possible global consequences. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=160.36s)]
*  Of course, the White House says these warnings have been exaggerated. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=166.28s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=170.96s)]
*  I'm glad you point this out because it is a completely reckless budget. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=173.12s)]
*  And this is the last time any Republican should lecture us about debts or deficit. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=178.0s)]
*  We have a 36 trillion dollar debt. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=182.72s)]
*  We have a two trillion dollar yearly deficit. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  President Biden had a plan to bring down that deficit by about a trillion dollars a year [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=189.76s)]
*  to move us back to having deficits not be more than 4 percent of GDP. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=196.2s)]
*  The Republicans just passed a budget that would add 3.8 trillion dollars over the next [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=201.24s)]
*  10 years to the existing two trillion deficit we have, taking the deficit to GDP ratio to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=208.8s)]
*  8 percent, almost unprecedented, not in wartime. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=216.04s)]
*  And this is why you see the bond market reacting. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=219.88s)]
*  It's the most reckless economic policy of any modern administration. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=222.48s)]
*  Now this week, Elon Musk stepped back from his political work, supposedly with a farewell [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=229.16s)]
*  event in the Oval Office. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=235.56s)]
*  You've known Elon Musk a long time and you even offered to help him trim the federal [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  defense budget when he started his work with Doge. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=243.4s)]
*  How would you describe Musk's stamp on the federal government and on America over the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=247.56s)]
*  past four months? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=253.28s)]
*  It's been sadly destructive. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=256.04s)]
*  I mean, he's hollowed out USAID, that is our ability to help not just do humanitarian work, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=257.04s)]
*  but to build alliances. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=263.88s)]
*  He's decimated along with Robert Kennedy, the National Institute of Health. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=265.56s)]
*  They fired seven out of 18 of the directors that do medical research. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=269.32s)]
*  They're decimating the FDA that approves new drugs, hollowing out the VA that helps [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  veterans and not saving any money. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, the deficits as Musk himself has acknowledged are exploding, much worse deficits than anything [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  President Biden or President Obama ever had. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  They are exploding the deficit. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=292.4s)]
*  And so, you know, I've said my fair share of things in politics. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=294.41999999999996s)]
*  Some turn out to be right, some not. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=297.28s)]
*  One of the things I said is he's going to get frustrated in four to five months. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=298.96s)]
*  And I was spot on. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  And the reality is that there was no desire in Republicans to cut actually the defense [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=304.0s)]
*  budget or the fossil fuel subsidies or the actual waste. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=309.56s)]
*  They've exploded the deficits and they've hurt people. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=313.32s)]
*  Now pivoting to Trump's war on higher education, the administration is threatening to revoke [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=316.2s)]
*  visas held by Chinese nationals in California. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  That means as many as 50,000 students could be impacted. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=326.96s)]
*  What would that mean for the state's university system? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=331.96s)]
*  And how can it push back? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=335.84s)]
*  Well, the irony is that a president wants to lower the trade deficit is actually taking [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=338.4s)]
*  a sledgehammer to one of our biggest exports, which is our universities. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=344.0s)]
*  The international students actually pay often full tuition. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  And it is one of the things that helps us finance the education of Americans. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=353.54s)]
*  And then by banning these international students, I mean, at Harvard, he's banned all international [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=358.38s)]
*  students right now. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=362.68s)]
*  Guess who was an international student? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=363.68s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=365.58000000000004s)]
*  He was a foreign student. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=366.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, so he is taking a sledgehammer to all of the students who've come here and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  created jobs here and companies here. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  And with China, now what are they going to do? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=376.34000000000003s)]
*  They're going to stay and create those jobs and companies in China. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=378.54s)]
*  It's a destructive policy and it is a xenophobic policy to single out all Chinese students. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=381.26s)]
*  That bears repeating Elon Musk was a foreign student. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=389.9s)]
*  But I'm out of time. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=393.62s)]
*  But before I let you go, I have to ask you about the track and field championship going [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=394.96s)]
*  on this weekend in Clovis, California, that has attracted the unwanted attention of the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=400.18s)]
*  for allowing a transgender girl to participate. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=407.46000000000004s)]
*  In response, Trump threatened to pull California's federal funding unless it bars transgender [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=411.3s)]
*  athletes from girls sports. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=418.58s)]
*  And as DOJ says, it will investigate the state and the school district for possible sex discrimination [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=421.02000000000004s)]
*  by allowing this girl to participate. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=428.98s)]
*  What would be the right way to handle this situation in your view? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=432.46s)]
*  First, Reverend, let me just say, you know what I resent? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=436.06s)]
*  I resent that Donald Trump is trying to bring in the transgender issue to distract from [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=439.82s)]
*  policies that are giving tax breaks to billionaires, racking up deficits, taking away Medicare, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=446.74s)]
*  Medicaid from ordinary people, taking away food stamps. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=453.02s)]
*  And instead of talking about actually improving people's lives, he's picking on the trans [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=456.62s)]
*  community. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=461.14s)]
*  We have a system and it's a pretty fair system. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=462.82s)]
*  It says local athletic associations should make these decisions. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=465.18s)]
*  They should balance inclusion along with fairness and safety. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=469.5s)]
*  We have a California Scholastic Association that does that. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=473.58s)]
*  You know what I'd like? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=476.97999999999996s)]
*  I'd like a president of the United States to focus on real issues, on lowering the deficit, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=477.97999999999996s)]
*  on helping people, on getting health care and stop dividing this country with these [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=482.9s)]
*  cultural wars that Trump is doing. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=487.34s)]
*  Well, I think the fact is that he uses his cultural wars to evade and avoid real issues, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=489.86s)]
*  like the deficit at $36 trillion and would go up, what, another $2.5 trillion if this [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=499.3s)]
*  bill goes through. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=507.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwK7bPjCrs&t=519.5s)]
