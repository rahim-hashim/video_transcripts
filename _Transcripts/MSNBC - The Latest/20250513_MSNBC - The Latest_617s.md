# Some in GOP 'clutch their pearls' over the Qatari jet — but will they actually do anything?
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38)

*  detail. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=25.3s)]
*  My colleague, Garrett Haik, has a closer look. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=26.3s)]
*  President Trump tonight the guest of honor at a lavish Saudi Arabian state dinner, capping [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  off a day of spectacle and statecraft. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=35.32s)]
*  Saudi fighter jets escorting Air Force One into Riyadh, where the president was met by [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=38.86s)]
*  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=43.1s)]
*  The motorcade escorted by an honor guard on horseback. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=45.54s)]
*  The president touting new deals, with the Saudis agreeing to buy $142 billion of American [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=50.18s)]
*  military equipment. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=55.82s)]
*  Part of what the White House says is a $600 billion investment in the U.S. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=57.42s)]
*  You're going to be creating tremendous numbers of jobs in the United States. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=61.34s)]
*  The president noting a better than expected inflation report, now down to 2.3 percent [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=65.14s)]
*  compared to a year ago, the smallest increase in four years, and bringing with him a host [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=69.74000000000001s)]
*  of top American business executives, including Elon Musk and the CEOs of Amazon, Coca-Cola, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=74.94s)]
*  and Nvidia, and announcing he'll lift sanctions on Syria's new government at the urging of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=81.22s)]
*  the Saudi Crown Prince. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=85.86s)]
*  I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=87.66s)]
*  at greatness. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=93.54s)]
*  Or what I do for the Crown Prince. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=94.54s)]
*  And while Trump is talking about making big deals for this country, his family has been [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=101.14s)]
*  making big deals for themselves in the Middle East. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=105.54s)]
*  The Trump Organization has entered into real estate deals with each country Trump is visiting. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  In one of those countries, the UAE is also financially involved with the Trump family's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=113.78s)]
*  growing crypto empire. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=117.78s)]
*  And of course, there is the huge controversy about Trump's plan to accept the gift of a [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=120.1s)]
*  super luxury jet from Qatar to use as Air Force One. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=125.62s)]
*  We've even seen some Republicans speak out against it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=129.9s)]
*  Trump is visiting Qatar later this week. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=132.82s)]
*  And with that, let's bring in our leadoff panel, Jeff Mason, White House correspondent [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=135.18s)]
*  for Reuters, Carol Lenning, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter with The Washington [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=138.7s)]
*  Post, and Daniela Diaz, a congressional reporter for Notis. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=142.7s)]
*  Jeff, we're going to get into the overt grift in a second, but from a policy perspective, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=145.98s)]
*  the decision to make this his first foreign trip, what is that signal about how he, his [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=150.89999999999998s)]
*  administration are repositioning America's place on the world stage? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  It's not a major foreign trip. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=160.7s)]
*  It's important to remind us or to remember that he also went to Rome for the Pope's funeral. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=163.54s)]
*  wrong to ask the question about why make this basically his first statement in terms of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=168.46s)]
*  foreign travel, going to the Middle East and starting off in Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=176.26000000000002s)]
*  I was on the president's first foreign trip as a first-term president, and he went to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=180.10000000000002s)]
*  Saudi Arabia then, too. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=185.3s)]
*  And I think the message then and the message now is that this president is deeply interested [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  in the relationship between Saudi and the United States. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=192.66s)]
*  The paradigm that we all know to use with regard to President Trump in terms of dealmaking [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=197.02s)]
*  applies perfectly to this trip. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=201.74s)]
*  That's what he did. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=203.46s)]
*  That's what he's doing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=204.46s)]
*  And the dealmaking applies, in this case, both as deals for the country and deals for [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=205.70000000000002s)]
*  himself and his family. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=210.54000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the latter is what makes this so unusual, Jeff. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=211.9s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=217.98000000000002s)]
*  And over the context of another story that I know we're going to talk about in terms [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=220.3s)]
*  of the gift from the Qataris of this plane, it's, I don't know if we want to use the word [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=225.26s)]
*  overshadowing, underlining, underscoring his entire trip. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=230.94s)]
*  Let's talk, Carol, before we get there about Trump calling MBS an incredible man, calling [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=236.54s)]
*  him a friend, the same guy you have US intel believing ordered the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=241.7s)]
*  Yeah, and let's not put too fine a point on it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=246.85999999999999s)]
*  Ordering the dismembering, the bonesawing of a journalist who was critical of MBS and his [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=249.98s)]
*  father and had written about authoritarian moves in that country. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=255.78s)]
*  Authoritarianism doesn't bother Donald Trump, obviously. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  In fact, he is trying in every way in his last 110 days in office to connect himself [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=263.82s)]
*  with authoritarian moves to consolidate power and control it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=274.18s)]
*  I've never seen someone clamp down on it so tightly. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=277.5s)]
*  And so when he calls MBS a grand man, it's for two reasons. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=280.21999999999997s)]
*  One, the guy has a lot of money and that is very appealing to Donald Trump. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=283.58s)]
*  I couldn't agree more with Jeff about the deal making. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=287.94s)]
*  That's that's first and foremost. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=290.34s)]
*  But second, it's it's the way in which some of these leaders lead their country the way [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=292.21999999999997s)]
*  he wants to lead America. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  Let's go back to the Qatari jet. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=298.06s)]
*  I think it is notable, Daniella, that you do have Republicans on the Hill saying, I [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=300.17999999999995s)]
*  don't know how I feel about this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=306.14s)]
*  The fact you have Ben Shapiro out in the right wing blogosphere saying this is actually [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=307.38s)]
*  going to get in the way of Trump's agenda. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=312.5s)]
*  When you talk to folks on the Hill, do you have any sense that they might actually take [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=314.65999999999997s)]
*  action, use the power of oversight, use the power of judiciary to hold the president [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=319.53999999999996s)]
*  responsible? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=324.46s)]
*  I mean, we just heard from Josh Hawley just a few hours ago saying that he doesn't believe [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=325.14s)]
*  that the president should have this much power to accept a gift like this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=329.02s)]
*  He's getting a lot of criticism from rank and file Republicans in the Senate. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=331.97999999999996s)]
*  Even John Thune spoke out saying he wasn't even sure if this deal was real. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=335.82s)]
*  We heard from Shelley Moore Capito, who is also in leadership, saying she didn't really [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=339.9s)]
*  think this was a good idea. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=343.21999999999997s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson just a few hours ago saying, I don't know. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=344.7s)]
*  I haven't seen the details. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=348.5s)]
*  Avoiding the question from reporters. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=349.58s)]
*  This is really tricky for them to wiggle around because it is not the best moment right [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=351.85999999999996s)]
*  now for President Donald Trump to say that he's accepting this gift. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=357.97999999999996s)]
*  And I would argue what Jeff said, it is overshadowing his trip right now abroad. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=360.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, just because you accept a bribe in public does not not make it a bribe. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=365.3s)]
*  You know, that is so interesting the way you put that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=370.26s)]
*  And many of the people that I've interviewed have described exactly that, that he's sort [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=372.26s)]
*  of trying to cleanse a self-enrichment platform by doing it right in front of everyone and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=377.18s)]
*  getting angry the other day, right? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  In the White House, when reporters, Jeff probably included, asked, do you think this is a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  conflict of interest potentially? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=388.74s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=390.58000000000004s)]
*  I'm so glad you brought up the Republicans and their concern, both of you, because what [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=391.26s)]
*  who are they hearing from? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=395.74s)]
*  They're hearing from national security and intelligence officials behind the scenes who [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=396.82s)]
*  are saying, what are we doing taking a plane that could be loaded with surveillance equipment [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=401.38s)]
*  and flying the president of the United States? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=406.58s)]
*  And if I could just add, Carol, you definitely know this better than me, but I'm seeing that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=409.06s)]
*  it's going to cost millions of dollars to retrofit this this plane to make sure that [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=412.53999999999996s)]
*  there's nothing wrong with it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=418.34s)]
*  Should we get it? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=419.86s)]
*  And of course, Trump is touting on social. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=420.86s)]
*  This is a free plane. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=422.9s)]
*  This is a gift to the United States, but it's going to end up costing taxpayers a lot of [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  money. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=428.1s)]
*  Totally. And it undercuts the whole theory of like, oh, I'm tired of waiting for Boeing. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=428.46s)]
*  I need a good plane now. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=432.78000000000003s)]
*  Like, well, it's going to take a little while. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=434.46s)]
*  Well, and then let's layer onto that, Jeff, the fact that you have cutters saying that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=436.7s)]
*  the deal is still under review. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=440.06s)]
*  Trump clear again today. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=442.9s)]
*  He wants that jet. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=444.58s)]
*  Where is this going from here? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=446.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think the Daniela mentioned that some people that she had spoken to in [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=448.94s)]
*  Congress weren't sure if this was really happening. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=453.42s)]
*  It's absolutely happening from the White House perspective. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=455.74s)]
*  That doesn't mean there's not going to be a way to stop it or that others might not get [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=458.54s)]
*  in the way, but it's absolutely something that the president wants. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=462.94s)]
*  And he's made that clear and officials around him that made that clear to your question [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=466.06s)]
*  in terms of next steps. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=471.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=472.22s)]
*  I mean, they clearly were going to have to figure out a few things, including the security [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=473.38s)]
*  issues and the costs involved in that and how you proceed with such an unusual gift [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=477.86s)]
*  from a foreign government that will be used as as the traveling White House in the air. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=483.94s)]
*  That's what Air Force One is. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=489.58000000000004s)]
*  And the security aspects and pieces of that, in addition to the kind of ethical questions [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=491.18s)]
*  that we're asking, are all are all things that will still need to be answered. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=497.78000000000003s)]
*  I do want to say one other thing, though, picking up from what Daniela said about Speaker [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=501.18s)]
*  Mike Johnson, but Mike Johnson, when when leaders like Mike Johnson say I'm not familiar [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=505.78s)]
*  with the details, President Trump uses that as an answer to sometimes when it's just not [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=511.5s)]
*  something he wants to talk about. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=516.1s)]
*  This is a story that's been around now for a couple of days. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=518.02s)]
*  It's it's I think pretty hard to accept that the details aren't clear and aren't being [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=520.74s)]
*  discussed at a level of Republican leadership and people around the president and people [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=525.62s)]
*  in his circle. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=530.42s)]
*  Let's talk about how this likely would would be litigated because we watched a version of [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=531.5s)]
*  this under Trump 1.0. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=535.9399999999999s)]
*  You watched Congress try to bring a case. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=537.9s)]
*  They were told they did not have standing. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=541.3s)]
*  You also had another case that was brought by a group that included crew ultimately gets [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=543.22s)]
*  to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court says, well, at this point, he's no longer president. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=548.1s)]
*  So they punt on the question. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=551.3s)]
*  I mean, the the fact that the Supreme Court didn't weigh in when they had the chance [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=553.42s)]
*  essentially means that legally folks are starting here on a blank slate. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=558.9s)]
*  Should there be an appetite to bring lawsuits here? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=563.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think someone the other day said that this this idea that I had to write a lot about [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=568.34s)]
*  this at the time, you know, all the ways in which the Trump family was enriching itself by [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=574.26s)]
*  having foreign and domestic visits to various hotels where the Secret Service would then [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=579.1s)]
*  have to pay for those places, all the foreign travel where the Secret Service was going to end up at [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=584.9399999999999s)]
*  Trump's hotels. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=589.22s)]
*  You know, it now seems so minor and quaint that those were a physical manifestation, a plane. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxLNeoV5A38&t=590.62s)]
