# Sell, sell, sell: How Trump is destroying America's economic street cred
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA)
*  Let's say the president gets his wish and replaces Jay Powell. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=0.0s)]
*  Not just who is he going to be, not the name of who is he going to put in that seat, but [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  what can that new Fed chair do to get us out of this vortex that we're in? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=8.64s)]
*  Well, unless he makes a Faustian bargain with the president to lower interest rates and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=13.16s)]
*  potentially soften the blow from any impending recession, or he could exacerbate inflationary [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=17.2s)]
*  pressures that come from the tariffs that are currently in place, we don't know. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=22.36s)]
*  It's hard to say what any Fed chair could do. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=27.68s)]
*  By the way, he's not the only voter on the Policy Setting Committee of the Federal Reserve. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=31.14s)]
*  There are many others who voice their opinions and offer their votes, one of whom could be [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=34.92s)]
*  Jerome Powell, whose position as chair may expire in 2026, but he remains a governor [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=39.32s)]
*  until 2028. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=45.8s)]
*  He could stay on for another two years on the board of governors at the Federal Reserve, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=47.08s)]
*  so he would still have a small say, to be exact, one-twelfth of the decision-making [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=50.86s)]
*  process. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  But I don't know what a Fed chair would do if indeed the president replaced Jay Powell, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=57.04s)]
*  which is currently illegal, but if he tried, what we do know is there'd be even more market [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=64.12s)]
*  chaos than we have now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=68.16s)]
*  Tyler, can we go back to the trifecta I mentioned, stocks, bonds, and the dollar all dropping, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=69.48s)]
*  this clear sign that global investors are saying, we don't feel great about America [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  right now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=81.44s)]
*  When do we get to a point where this reality breaks through to this White House? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=83.0s)]
*  What is happening inside the White House with Trump and his team as they're looking at these [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=87.72s)]
*  numbers every day? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=91.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think a big focus for the Trump team right now is trying to make trade [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=94.5s)]
*  deals with some of these countries during this 90-day pause. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=98.6s)]
*  One of the things that I think is important to note is that these trade deals are usually [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=102.68s)]
*  the work of months, if not years, of delicate negotiations. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=106.88s)]
*  Trade deals, Stephanie, as you know, are very complex and require a lot of hashing out the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=112.12s)]
*  details. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=116.88s)]
*  And that is not what Trump is allowing for with this 90-day pause. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=117.88s)]
*  There's a rush of activity to try to get these deals done. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=121.76s)]
*  And some experts say it's likely maybe one or two of them with close allies, maybe Japan [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=124.76s)]
*  and South Korea, could get done in that timeframe. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=129.84s)]
*  But that's unlikely to change the global economic picture. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=132.56s)]
*  And so I think one of the things that we have to watch for is the Trump administration, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=137.52s)]
*  the president and his allies have said that Americans may need to deal with some short-term [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=142.02s)]
*  pain for long-term gain, that they are right-sizing the global economic market and ensuring that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=146.9s)]
*  Americans are getting a fair trade deal with partners. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=152.78s)]
*  The question is, how long is that bargain? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=156.9s)]
*  And one of the larger things looming over all of this is this idea that Trump has put [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=161.54000000000002s)]
*  forth that they are going to restart a manufacturing boom in the United States. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=166.02s)]
*  That is not something that can happen overnight. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=171.44s)]
*  And so if that's the sort of timeframe or horizon that we're looking on, Americans are [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  going to be under some pressure when it comes to prices for quite some time. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=177.88s)]
*  Twenty years and about a few trillion dollars. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=184.28s)]
*  I want to share a bit of what our colleague Steve Leesman said earlier about how the economy [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=186.4s)]
*  is tied to pretty much most of what Trump is doing these days. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=190.84s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=194.8s)]
*  Let me see if I can connect this to the things that you report on all day long, which is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=195.8s)]
*  not necessarily the financial markets, but what's going on with the Supreme Court, what's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  going on with the legal firms, going on with Harvard and these other things. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  There are things that the president has done that nobody ever thought a president would [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  do. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  And that's why in financial markets you cannot dismiss some probability that the president [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  will fire the Fed chair. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  People say, oh, it's not going to happen. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  I said, well, we thought he was going to follow the Supreme Court. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=223.28s)]
*  We thought he was not going to necessarily withhold X billions of dollars from Harvard. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=226.12s)]
*  So it's all of the same piece in that you cannot relax and you cannot bet on a team [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=230.36s)]
*  where the captain is hitting the ball into his own net. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=236.4s)]
*  Susan, what is your reaction? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=240.24s)]
*  I mean, you know this for the last eight years, big Trump supporters have said, oh, that's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=241.84s)]
*  just his bluster. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=246.04s)]
*  He's not going to do it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=247.04s)]
*  But here we have it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=248.56s)]
*  He's doing it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=249.72s)]
*  I think it's right to connect the dots between the assault on many different independent [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=253.16s)]
*  institutions, which is a theme that has run through the not quite 100 days of this second [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=257.56s)]
*  Trump term. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=262.4s)]
*  And I would point out that as far as Chairman Powell goes, you noted that he was appointed [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=263.4s)]
*  by Donald Trump in his first term. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=268.16s)]
*  Donald Trump also repeatedly threatened to fire Powell in his first term. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=270.12s)]
*  In fact, we did reporting for our book, The Divider, and it was clear that some senior [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=275.56s)]
*  officials at the Fed literally could not go to sleep for months worrying about the next [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=280.48s)]
*  day being the day that there would be a constitutional crisis, an impasse between the Independent [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=285.2s)]
*  Federal Reserve and the White House. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=291.6s)]
*  It didn't come to pass in part because it was a very different regime at that time. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=294.4s)]
*  And Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, you know, essentially spent almost full time managing [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=298.56s)]
*  Trump to avoid that kind of catastrophe. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=303.92s)]
*  By the way, Powell was prepared to spend, quote, every last nickel of his own money. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=306.88s)]
*  And he has millions and millions of dollars in order to go to court to stop Donald Trump [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=312.44s)]
*  from eroding the independence of the American central bank, which many Wall Street investors, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=318.0s)]
*  of course, believe is one of the pillars of our economy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  So if Trump takes the next step, I would expect Powell to consider very seriously suing him. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=326.64s)]
*  I would expect there to be a major crisis that obviously will add further instability [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=332.36s)]
*  into our markets and a level of uncertainty at the core of the American financial system [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=337.76s)]
*  that I think is unlike anything we've ever seen if there is that kind of outright confrontation [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=343.36s)]
*  between the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the president of the United States. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=348.12s)]
*  David, almost everything Susan just laid out, I've heard from Wall Street investors and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  bankers over the last five days. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=357.8s)]
*  The last thing they want to see is Jay Powell fired, even if they're not big supporters [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=359.68s)]
*  of him and the Fed losing their independence. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=364.56s)]
*  Very few of them are speaking publicly despite their panic. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=369.52s)]
*  What does that tell you about the fear they have or the concern they have about speaking [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=373.6s)]
*  publicly because none of these people, none of these big investors are shy when it comes [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=377.92s)]
*  to press time? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=382.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's because they paid attention the last decade or so and they've seen how [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=383.8s)]
*  Donald Trump lashes out at critics. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=388.56s)]
*  They have businesses to run, they have investment funds to manage, and they cannot afford to [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=391.0s)]
*  be on the receiving end of a president who is willing to stretch the bounds of executive [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  power. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=401.72s)]
*  And, look, people might be surprised based on what they thought they would get from Trump, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=402.72s)]
*  based on what they got from Trump the first term, but they shouldn't be. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=409.64000000000004s)]
*  Trump always enjoys chaos. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=414.52s)]
*  He is comfortable in it, especially when he's at the center of it and all of the chaos revolves [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=416.48s)]
*  around him. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=422.84s)]
*  And so I think you can expect, particularly because tariffs are the one thing that he [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=423.84s)]
*  is an ideal logged on, that he will keep pushing this and pushing this and try and get other [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=428.44s)]
*  aspects of government to sort of open a relief valve, if you will, to make the impact of [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=436.68s)]
*  the tariffs and his indecision easier for the economy to stomach. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=447.04s)]
*  I think the question is whether or not the Treasury Secretary, Besant, and Lutnick on [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=453.28s)]
*  occasion can get through to him to have him sort of soften the edges of what he's doing. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=461.96s)]
*  They were able to do it somewhat with the 90-day pause. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=468.2s)]
*  The 90 days is going to run out. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=471.35999999999996s)]
*  What is going to happen then? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=473.56s)]
*  Ron, you wrote today about what it would do to America's global reputation if the president [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=475.12s)]
*  replaces the Fed chair. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=481.67999999999995s)]
*  I want you to lay it out for us. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's like any other kind of chaotic event except orders of magnitude larger. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=484.67999999999995s)]
*  Pure chaos, but way worse. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=491.76s)]
*  But way worse. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=493.8s)]
*  No, from what we've experienced now, tariffs, you can argue all day long about whether they're [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=494.8s)]
*  worthwhile or not, even though they're slowing the economy and affecting consumers or will [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=498.92s)]
*  affect consumers sometime soon. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=503.0s)]
*  Independent Federal Reserve, or broadly speaking, an independent central bank is the gold standard [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  of modern economics. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br74KMiBDTA&t=510.8s)]
