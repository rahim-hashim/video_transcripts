# Trump is targeting Harvard to 'divide and conquer Americans': Harvard Prof. Cornell William Brooks
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM)
*  Joining me now is Cornell William Brooks, professor of the practice of public leadership [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=0.0s)]
*  and social justice at Harvard Kennedy School. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=6.34s)]
*  He's also the former president and CEO of the NAACP, and he's a civil rights attorney [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=12.02s)]
*  as well. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=19.32s)]
*  Thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=20.32s)]
*  Let me start with Trump has moved to strip Harvard of more than $2 billion in federal [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=22.8s)]
*  grants, threatened to redirect $3 billion in research funding to vocational schools, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=29.86s)]
*  and sent a letter to federal agencies instructing them to review the approximately $100 million [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=36.46s)]
*  in contracts the government has awarded Harvard and find alternative vendors where possible. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=43.74s)]
*  That was just this week. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  Why has Trump targeted Harvard so heavily? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=55.04s)]
*  So we need to be very clear here and not be distracted by Ivy, prestige, or even the size [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=59.66s)]
*  of Harvard's endowment. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=67.53999999999999s)]
*  This is really an effort to divide and conquer Americans. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=69.32s)]
*  So in other words, in the wake of the war in Gaza, there were instances of anti-Semitism [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=72.88s)]
*  and Islamophobia on Harvard's campus, Harvard Commission, a set of reports, a set of recommendations, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=82.62s)]
*  and a set of actions. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=89.52s)]
*  In the wake of that, the Trump administration has targeted Harvard and talked about anything [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  but anti-Semitism. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=96.46s)]
*  And here's what I mean. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=97.46s)]
*  They have launched this ban against international students, students from Israel as well as [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=100.06s)]
*  Gaza, from France as well as Switzerland. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=107.0s)]
*  They threatened Harvard's tax exempt status. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=109.94s)]
*  They have attempted to micromanage Harvard's governance. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=114.7s)]
*  And to be clear, this week, according to news reports, the Trump administration has been [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=120.72000000000001s)]
*  looking for a named school, an Ivy League school, to cut a deal with so that they could [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=126.5s)]
*  focus on DEI and efforts to limit the participation of Black and Brown students. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=134.3s)]
*  The point being here is they're not focused on anti-Semitism. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=141.66s)]
*  What they're focused on is a kind of anti-Americanism, which is to say a nation of many people from [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  many places around the world who come to this country to study and who participate in this [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=152.34s)]
*  democracy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=158.96s)]
*  So we have to be very clear here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=159.96s)]
*  This is a divide and conquer strategy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=161.72s)]
*  Now international students comprise more than a quarter of Harvard's student body. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=164.4s)]
*  But it isn't just Harvard that relies heavily on international students. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=169.96s)]
*  All American universities do, because they often pay far more in tuition than their American [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=174.54000000000002s)]
*  classmates. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=181.38s)]
*  So why is Trump targeting this population? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=182.56s)]
*  So he's operating on the mistaken assumption that you can erect borders around American [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=186.84s)]
*  as in these tariff wars and borders around American college campuses as in a kind of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=194.42s)]
*  idea tariff war, so to speak. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  Here's my point. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  Harvard is one out of every four students as an international student. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  But think about this. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  It was international students and money from abroad that literally kept state universities [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  in business in the wake of the COVID crisis. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=217.61999999999998s)]
*  So because our universities all across the country are so outstanding, we have people [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=221.3s)]
*  coming from around the world to study here in this country to subsidize, to support, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=227.22s)]
*  to enable American-born students to study in colleges and universities. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=233.22s)]
*  And this is true from the community college level, state universities, research universities, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  private universities, and the Ivy League. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=245.3s)]
*  So we have to be very clear. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=248.4s)]
*  Again, this is divide and conquer, but it's also a strategy of divide and diminishing [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=249.4s)]
*  American competitiveness and the American economy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=254.28s)]
*  Now Trump is already facing a backlash for his move against foreign students. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  Even some of his big money supporters rely on talent from overseas. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=262.48s)]
*  But even if he decides to backtrack on this policy, hasn't he already made America a less [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=267.24s)]
*  attractive place for the best and the brightest from around the world to come study because [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=274.44000000000005s)]
*  of the way he's handling things right now? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=279.16s)]
*  Your question contains a brilliant answer, and the answer is absolutely yes. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=282.88000000000005s)]
*  How so? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=287.6s)]
*  In other words, by making international students call it to question whether or not they can [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=288.6s)]
*  study, whether they can matriculate and graduate from American institutions, it makes American [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  colleges and universities less competitive in a global marketplace for top researchers, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=299.86s)]
*  scholars. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  And let's be clear. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  We're talking about people who start companies that employ Americans, initiate research that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  protect Americans and that heal Americans. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=313.42s)]
*  We're talking about people who literally contribute to this country, some of whom become citizens [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=316.66s)]
*  in this country. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=322.1s)]
*  The other part of this is that by launching this war against colleges and universities, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=323.1s)]
*  we as a country are hurt reputationally, literally around the globe. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  So in other words, despite the fact that we have a federal judge who's issued a temporary [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  restraining order in terms of this international student ban, he's already done damage and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=340.6s)]
*  the damage continues. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=347.14000000000004s)]
*  Which is to say you may see fewer students registered in fall who are paying less tuition, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=349.08s)]
*  less room on board, which makes it harder for us to support American students. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=354.88s)]
*  Let's step back and look at the big picture. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  You and I have been active in the civil rights movement for many years. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=362.58s)]
*  You were when you were president and CEO of NAACP, worked with me at National Action Network. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=366.56s)]
*  I remember you preached one Saturday morning at our rally. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=371.79999999999995s)]
*  We know the academic community has played a critical role in moving our society forward, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=375.38s)]
*  both students and faculty. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=380.97999999999996s)]
*  How much of this current MAGA assault on higher education goes all the way back to the 1960s? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=383.06s)]
*  Are we still locked in the same struggle? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=390.41999999999996s)]
*  We're very much locked in the same struggle. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=394.9s)]
*  In fact, these struggles are united. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=396.34s)]
*  As you well know, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended discrimination, at least on paper, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=398.58s)]
*  in this country. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=404.54s)]
*  The Immigration Act of 1965, which was predicated on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, ended discrimination [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=406.14000000000004s)]
*  in immigration, lifting the caps on the number of people who could come from Africa, could [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=414.5s)]
*  come from Latin America and Asia and other parts of the world. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=420.22s)]
*  So in other words, civil rights and human rights are linked together. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=425.06s)]
*  So when you decline to really address anti-Semitism, stoke Islamophobia, target black and brown [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=428.94s)]
*  students, target DEI, target affirmative action, all of that in an unconstitutional, unlawful [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=438.14s)]
*  manner, here's what happens. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=445.5s)]
*  You divide the country, you make the country less competitive, you pit people against one [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=447.42s)]
*  another, and it is ultimately harmful to the republic. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=454.26s)]
*  So the point being here is you and I have been in this work, been at this work a long [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=458.02000000000004s)]
*  time, and we know this. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=463.62s)]
*  Unless people stand together, they will be victimized together. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=465.98s)]
*  Now, before I let you go, I've been thinking of the last weekend and the fifth year anniversary [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=469.26s)]
*  of the murder of George Floyd. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=476.54s)]
*  I was in Houston speaking and joining his family at his gravesite. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=478.02000000000004s)]
*  The administration has targeted institutions like college campuses, libraries and schools [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=483.06s)]
*  where the story of black America is being written every day. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=489.26s)]
*  They've suggested there's something less American or unpatriotic about our perspectives. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=493.02s)]
*  How can all of us push back and keep them from controlling the narrative? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=499.7s)]
*  Well, first of all, this is a brilliant question. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=503.97999999999996s)]
*  We have to be clear here. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=507.56s)]
*  The protests that we saw in the wake of George Floyd's murder, 26 million Americans taken [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=509.22s)]
*  to the streets across 550 jurisdictions, represents a protest story as powerful as the Boston [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=515.22s)]
*  Tea Party. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=523.68s)]
*  So in order for us in this moment to take charge of the narrative, we need to be clear [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=524.82s)]
*  that history is tied to protest, protest is tied to democracy. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=529.14s)]
*  One. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=534.0200000000001s)]
*  Point two, we need to be very clear. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=535.0200000000001s)]
*  Our movements have to be coordinated, have to be united. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=537.1800000000001s)]
*  We have to resist the forces of fractionalization and division in this moment. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1z8G_zLkM&t=540.4200000000001s)]
