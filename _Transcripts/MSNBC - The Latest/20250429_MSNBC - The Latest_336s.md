# ‘Untenable position’: Fmr. ICE official on mothers deported from the U.S.
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4)
*  All right, joining us now is John Sedwig. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh, Sandwig, former acting director of immigration and customs enforcement, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=2.56s)]
*  ICE under President Obama and former federal prosecutor Barrett Berger. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=6.96s)]
*  John, sorry about that. It's been a long day here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=10.72s)]
*  I do want to ask you, deportations are, of course, nothing new. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. government does them all the time. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=16.48s)]
*  The Obama administration did them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=18.16s)]
*  The Biden administration did them. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=19.44s)]
*  When it comes to children who are U.S. citizens of people being deported, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=21.04s)]
*  how is that usually handled? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=26.0s)]
*  Is there a process for this? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=27.44s)]
*  And if so, was that followed in these cases? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=28.88s)]
*  Well, typically you want to avoid these cases to the greatest extent possible. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=32.8s)]
*  And I think the larger question is here is, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=36.24s)]
*  why were we prioritizing this woman in the first place? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=38.48s)]
*  This woman, based on what I'm seeing, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=41.28s)]
*  it looks like she had what's called a stay of removal, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  meaning that she had gone through the immigration courts [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=44.8s)]
*  and ICE had chosen to allow her to stay in the United States [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=47.04s)]
*  because of those U.S. citizen children. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=50.0s)]
*  The problem is, once she's taken into custody, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=51.92s)]
*  and they say you have three days here, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=53.92s)]
*  regardless of whether or not she had a meaningful choice [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=55.84s)]
*  as to whether or not to give her kids to somebody else, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=58.64s)]
*  it is incredibly difficult under those circumstances [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=60.96s)]
*  to make an informed decision. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=63.6s)]
*  And then, as I understand it as well, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=65.04s)]
*  the family members were coming forward and saying, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=66.48s)]
*  hey, we want to take custody of her. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=68.16s)]
*  And ICE was questioning the legitimacy of that relationship. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=70.0s)]
*  The point here is you put her in an untenable position where, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=73.04s)]
*  although technically she may have had a choice, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=75.92s)]
*  she really didn't have a choice [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=77.36s)]
*  and ultimately has to take her kids with her. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=79.12s)]
*  But again, we go to the larger question, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=80.72s)]
*  which is the president has promised us a focus on criminals, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=83.6s)]
*  a focus on gang members. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=86.32s)]
*  Why did we create this situation in the first place [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=88.24s)]
*  where was this urgent to take this mother and her kids [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  without giving her a meaningful opportunity [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=92.72s)]
*  to find some way to hand off her kids to a family member? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=94.8s)]
*  And Barrett, that's the question I keep asking. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=97.44s)]
*  You know, we even asked the Maryland man [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  who was deported to El Salvador as a lawyer [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=102.0s)]
*  how he got on this list, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=104.08s)]
*  how he became a target of these operations. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=105.52s)]
*  How are they choosing these individuals? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=108.08s)]
*  Do we know? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=110.16s)]
*  Do we know what qualifies someone to qualify for deportation? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=110.88s)]
*  As the administration has said, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=114.88s)]
*  they're focusing on gang members and criminals to that point. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=116.32s)]
*  How do moms and their kids get caught up in this sweep? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=118.96s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=122.8s)]
*  It really shows how the landscape has shifted [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  even in just the last hundred days. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=126.56s)]
*  The administration has said very publicly [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=128.8s)]
*  that they wanted to focus on MS-13 members, gang members, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  people who were here without cause [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=135.92s)]
*  who were then creating violence and committing crimes. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=139.76s)]
*  That's one thing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  Going after people who are here, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=145.12s)]
*  they may be undocumented, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  but they have children that are citizens, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=148.64s)]
*  some of whom have serious illnesses, is a radical shift. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  And it's so important, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=154.64s)]
*  and this really demonstrates why due process [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=155.76s)]
*  is so critical in cases like this. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=158.56s)]
*  Perhaps these mothers wanted to take their children with them. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  Perhaps that was a well-thought-out decision, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=164.16s)]
*  but we don't know. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=166.32s)]
*  There's no great record of that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=167.28s)]
*  We need to make sure those were decisions [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=169.04s)]
*  that were made willingly, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=170.88s)]
*  that they were made based on complete information, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=172.48s)]
*  and that everyone who had a stake in this case, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=175.92s)]
*  whether it's another parent or family members [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=178.32s)]
*  that may have one of these children to stay here, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  had the opportunity to be heard. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=183.28s)]
*  That's why due process is important. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=185.04s)]
*  And it really seems like that is the part [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=186.64s)]
*  that was missing from this whole process. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=191.04s)]
*  Also, if you've been picked up and you have your kids with you [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=191.28s)]
*  and you can't get ahold of anybody else [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  and you're being told you're leaving the country the next day, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=195.04s)]
*  is that really a choice? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=198.32s)]
*  What else are you going to do as a mother? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=199.28s)]
*  You're going to say, okay, let's take the kids with me. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=200.56s)]
*  John, I want to ask you, can you tell me, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=202.88s)]
*  how did deportations happen when you were at ICE? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  Did you get handed a list? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=207.44s)]
*  Did you get handed things that, you know, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=208.72s)]
*  categories of people that you wanted to deport, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=211.28s)]
*  and then you chose the individuals? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=213.28s)]
*  And is it different this time around than what you're used to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  or what had happened in the past? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=217.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, typically what ICE does, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=219.52s)]
*  we establish priorities. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=220.8s)]
*  And the priorities during the Obama administration, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=221.84s)]
*  during the Biden administration, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=223.44s)]
*  were individuals who pose a threat to public safety [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  or had recently crossed the border. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=226.88s)]
*  But we're at a transition point in the Trump administration, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=228.4s)]
*  and it all goes back to something [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=230.64s)]
*  that you guys reported on a minute ago, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=231.84s)]
*  which is these deportation numbers. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=233.68s)]
*  Deportation numbers, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=235.68s)]
*  when compared to the Biden administration, are down. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=236.64s)]
*  Certainly the number of arrests are up, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=239.12s)]
*  but the actual removals are down. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  There are complex reasons for that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=243.04s)]
*  A lot of it's related to the border. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=244.48s)]
*  But the biggest reason is these backlogs [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=246.24s)]
*  in the immigration court. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  So what's clearly happened over the last couple of weeks here [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=249.2s)]
*  is the administration is pivoting away from those criminals [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=251.68s)]
*  and gang members to people who can be quickly deported. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=254.24s)]
*  Who don't need to go back through the immigration court. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=257.2s)]
*  So when you look at this woman's case, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=259.2s)]
*  she falls into that category. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=260.8s)]
*  She had been ordered deported by an immigration court [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=262.24s)]
*  years earlier, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  but ICE had given her what's called a stay of removal. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  Said, because of these kids, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=267.36s)]
*  we're gonna let you stay in this country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  We don't wanna create this family separation issue. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=270.24s)]
*  She was checking in as she was required to do, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=272.8s)]
*  but the administration wants her as a target [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=275.2s)]
*  because she's already ordered removed. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=277.52s)]
*  They can put her on the next plane to Honduras very quickly. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=279.44s)]
*  So as we go forward, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  I think we're really just beginning to see these kinds of cases. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=283.04s)]
*  We're gonna see a lot more of them [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=285.52s)]
*  because the Trump administration needs to drive up [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=287.28s)]
*  or wants to drive up those deportation numbers. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=289.76s)]
*  And the way to do that is to focus on this population [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  that isn't the gang members, isn't the criminals, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYWioXVP_4&t=294.47999999999996s)]
