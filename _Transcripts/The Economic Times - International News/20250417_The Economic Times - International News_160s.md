Video Description: During a joint appearance at the White House, Trump criticised Europe’s immigration policies, calling them overly lenient and damaging. ‘I’m not a big fan of Europe and what they’ve done with immigration,’ he said, warning the continent is being “very badly hurt.” He praised Italian PM Giorgia Meloni’s tough stance, including her plan to process asylum seekers in Albania, though blocked by Italian courts. Meloni said Trump accepted an invitation to Rome to meet more EU leaders soon.

**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI)
*  Europe is very important to me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=0.0s)]
*  Europe is very important to the world. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=1.8s)]
*  I want Europe to do very well. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=3.68s)]
*  I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=5.48s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done with [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=8.56s)]
*  immigration at all. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=11.36s)]
*  And I think they've got to get smart, because Europe is being [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=13.32s)]
*  very badly hurt by what they've done with immigration. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=17.52s)]
*  You will see now the policies of the European Union in the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=20.2s)]
*  last, let's say, two and a half years have been changing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=23.56s)]
*  At the beginning, we were talking only about how we were [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=27.2s)]
*  redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=30.8s)]
*  Now we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=33.8s)]
*  Our friend Mr. Milley just said that you want to make Europe [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=37.92s)]
*  great again. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  And we want to do it together, together to bring Europe [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=42.6s)]
*  back to the West. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=44.84s)]
*  Did you, I guess, that's what you said, Mr. Prime Minister, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  how are you going to do that? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=50.28s)]
*  And are you looking to counter China? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  What is the role of the United States in the United States [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=55.04s)]
*  to do to help us join the United States? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=58.76s)]
*  I hope that Europe is going to be great again. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Europe has gone through a lot of problems and a lot of it's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=64.48s)]
*  having to do with immigration. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=67.2s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done with [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=69.36s)]
*  immigration at all. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=72.28s)]
*  And I think they've got to get smart because Europe is being [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=74.28s)]
*  very badly hurt by what they've done with immigration. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=78.48s)]
*  Now, I'll say this, that the Prime Minister has taken a very [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=81.12s)]
*  tough stand on immigration. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=84.24s)]
*  And I commented to her before, I said, I wish more people would [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=87.72s)]
*  be like you having to do with that subject, but they're not. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  Europe is very important to me. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  Europe is very important to the world. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=97.56s)]
*  I want Europe to do very well. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=104.64s)]
*  Doing it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  You've seen, you've all seen how the policies of the European [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=106.96s)]
*  Union in the last, let's say, two and a half years have been [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=110.36s)]
*  changing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=113.52s)]
*  OK, at the beginning, we were talking only about how we were [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=114.16s)]
*  redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  Now, we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=121.0s)]
*  work with the countries of origin and transit, and to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=125.56s)]
*  return people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=129.16s)]
*  The European Commission just did the new rules about [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=131.12s)]
*  repatriations and things like that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=135.16s)]
*  So things are changing, thanks also to the example that Italy [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=137.0s)]
*  brought in lowering the rates of illegal migration. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=141.6s)]
*  So we are working now together. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=146.2s)]
*  So I'm optimistic on that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt16DEJnHI&t=149.64s)]
